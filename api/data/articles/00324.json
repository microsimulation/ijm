                "text": "The models presented in this paper are intended to contribute to a debate on the impact of hypothetical changes in social security contributions and personal income tax on the distribution of household disposable income and on total public financial revenue from these sources for Luxembourg. Our aim is to take account as far as possible of the non-linearity of socio-fiscal systems and the precise structure of populations, hence the need for microsimulation modelling of both resident and cross-border commuter households. This latter population is involving an essential innovative extension compared with previous assessments. Cross-border commuters are very important in Luxembourg, accounting for over 40% of total employment: 41% in 2017, 43% in 2022. Static microsimulation tools and data are already available for residents (mainly via EUROMOD and EU-SILC), but not for cross-border commuter households. Therefore, there is need for a secondary simulation framework, for example based on EUROMOD and HFCS data (offering some information for cross-border commuters in addition), separately for resident and cross-border commuter households. Such publicly available distributional views on residents and cross-border commuters in countries with high openness where the latter may play an important role in public accounts are not numerous, or even unique in Luxembourg, if we except (expected) imputation-based approaches. The aim of this methodological article is to present the EUROMOD-type models implemented for the resident and cross-border commuter populations in Luxembourg and to highlight the particularities of their construction. Using these tools, we are then able to provide a complementary overview of the two populations \u201cas they are today\u201d. Another objective is to provide a toolbox for an immediate overview of tracks for \u2212 and impact of \u2212 changes in socio-economic policies. Given the important structural differences between resident and cross-border commuter populations in terms of socio-economic status and gross labor and taxable incomes, we show and explain to what extent total revenues from residents are higher than those from cross-border commuters, even considering the relative sizes of the two populations. For the same reason, a change in the socio-fiscal system of policies in Luxembourg could have remarkably different effects between cross-border commuter households and residents. More specifically, these results could also partially serve as a basis for the debate on a pension reform recently launched in Luxembourg. This research was initiated by the <i>Chambre des Salari\u00e9s du Luxembourg</i> (CSL). Consequently, the contents reported here result from exchanges with social partners (not all of whom are familiar with the technicalities of the context). Such a context allowed us to propose an approach more in line with the questions and final expectations of our usual public targets. The present paper also aims to \u201copen the black box\u201d, which can lead to contents that are sometimes technical, but accessible to \u201cpractitioners\u201d who would like to better understand the underlying forces and rely on these models for subsequent counterfactual analyses.",

This approach has been implemented in <i>Tables B</i>. It leads to a total amount of 10.31 billion \u20ac (<i>[TOT/SILC++]</i>), rather than 10.19 billion \u20ac mentioned earlier. Those outcomes are remarkably close each other (a 1.2%-gap).",

Numerous exchanges with experts (social partners) enabled us to provide an approach more in line with the questions and final expectations of our usual public targets.Yet the present paper mentioning Philippe Li\u00e9geois as sole author, its outcomes result from a larger network.The developments presented here are initially based on the model <a href=\"https://euromod-web.jrc.ec.europa.eu/\">EUROMOD/SILC</a> version I4.62+ Beta release (3.4.10). Originally maintained, developed and managed by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER), since 2021 EUROMOD is maintained (with regard to resident populations), developed and managed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission in Seville, in collaboration with EUROSTAT and national teams from the EU countries (including LISER for Luxembourg).The EUROMOD/HFCS-R model is building on the same core version as EUROMOD/SILC, yet running on HFCS data rather, and was developed for its base versions (socio-fiscal policies up to 2017) by Jonas Boone, Johannes Derboven, Sarah Kuypers and Gerlinde Verbist, from the University of Antwerp, together with Francesco Figari, from the Universit\u00e0 degli studi del Piemonte orientale. An extension to the new EUROMOD/HFCS-XB model, involving microdata related to cross-borders for Luxembourg, has been set up by Johannes Derboven, in collaboration with Philippe Li\u00e9geois. A specific documentation for extending EUROMOD/HFCS-XB to all cross-borders, through macro adjustments, was also gathered by Anasse El Maslohi, from LISER. Even if HFCS results from a European-wide effort, Michael Ziegelmeyer from the Banque Centrale du Luxembourg, and Carla Martins from LISER, more specifically but among many others, have indirectly supported the present study through their expertise in those data for Luxembourg.",
