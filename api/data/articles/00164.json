The model describes the natural history of lung cancer from a disease-free state to death. Predictions of individual trajectories depend on a set of covariates including age, sex, and smoking behaviors. The module presented here is designed as part of a comprehensive decision-making toolkit for evaluating lung cancer prevention, screening and treatment policies. The MILC package implements the model in the open-source statistical software R. This paper introduces the main components, simulation algorithm, and specifics of the MILC model, validates it by reproducing observed lung cancer incidence trends in the US population, and uses it to make plausible predictions for 50-year-old men and women with a range of smoking histories.",

Predicted trends about the quantities of interest, resulting from aggregation of a large number of microsimulations, are intended to guide policy decisions. In medical decision making MSMs usually describe the natural history of a disease, often in conjunction with the effect of some intervention, such as screening, treatment, etc. (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kopec, Edwards, Manuel, &amp; Rutter, 2012</a>). To this end they employ mathematical equations with stochastic assumptions to describe both observed and latent characteristics of the underlying process (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rutter, Zaslavsky, &amp; Feuer, 2011</a>).",

They also constitute a practical tool for combining information from various sources, including observational studies, clinical trials, expert opinions, etc., and simulating large pseudo-samples. Due to the great flexibility they provide to researchers, MSMs have proven so far one of the best ways to model the progression of chronic diseases (<a href=\"#bib35\">Oderkirk, Sassi, &amp; Cecchini, 2012</a>). The focus on the individual rather than the average patient can also prove them a very useful tool for assisting improvement of individualized patient care. Therefore microsimulation has risen to prominence as a promising tool for making projections about the impact of interventions (such as screening) when applied to population cohorts, and thus informing health policies and improving medical decision making (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kopec <i>et al</i>., 2012</a>). For example MSMs are often used in Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) studies, aimed at evaluating public health policies and their effect on health status of target populations <a href=\"#bib50\">Zucchelli, Jones, &amp; N., 2012</a>.",

Due to their complexity (combination of several stochastic and deterministic models, a usually large number of parameters, description of latent characteristics, etc.), model calibration requires advanced statistical techniques, and a huge number, usually of an order of magnitude of 12 or more, of microsimulations. The same holds for an extensive validation of the model, let alone a sensitivity analysis, hence it is self evident that the development of an MSM is a computationally highly intensive problem that necessitates special resources for implementing high performance computing techniques. Furthermore, the complexity of an MSM along with the fact that it often tries to describe latent phenomena lead to identifiability problems. The degree of accuracy and the validity of an MSM highly depend on the available information and data for building and calibrating the model. In addition, MSMs are subject to several sources of uncertainty, the combination and expression of which on the final outcomes is a problem not satisfactorily addressed yet (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li &amp; O\u2019Donoghue, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Rutter <i>et al</i>., 2011</a>).",

The model simulates the course of lung cancer from the disease-free state to the local, regional, and distant disease states and eventually to death either from lung cancer or some other cause.

However, unlike the MILC, the FHCRC model focuses on the effect of smoking on lung-cancer mortality without providing an explicit definition of the distinct disease states, or information on tumor diagnosis. The MISCAN-lung model by <a href=\"#bib15\">Habbema, van Oortmarssen, Lubbe, and van der Maas (1985)</a>, on the other hand, does not monitor tumor size in the simulation procedure. Finally, the key difference between the MILC and the Lung Cancer Policy Model (LCPM) by <a href=\"#bib32\">McMa-hon <i>et al</i>. (2012)</a> lies in the way they simulate the initiation of the local stage. The LCPM employs a logistic regression approach to estimate the risk for the onset of the first malignant cell, rather than the TSCE approach followed in the MILC model.",

It is well known that there are several other potential risk factors for lung cancer such as exposure to environmental hazards, second-hand smoking, family history, etc. These are important risk factors that, in certain cases, should be considered for a more accurate and realistic representation of the natural history of lung cancer.",
