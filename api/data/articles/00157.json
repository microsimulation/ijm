By \u201cstructure\u201d we mean the way in which different constituent parts are related to each other in terms of communication and decision-making. Most economies have a complex mix of different structures including markets, firms, and government agencies of various kinds. Despite their differences, all these structures face the common problem of coordinating the activities of constituent parts who possess private information. There are two ways in which markets, firms, and government agencies solve coordination problems: centralization and decentralization. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange has a central clearing house and quotation system (<a href=\"#bib19\">Millo, Muniesa, Panourgias, &amp; Scott, 2005</a>), but Torino\u2019s farmers market has no such central structure. Alfred Sloan granted considerable autonomy to division managers in General Motors (<a href=\"#bib27\">Sloan, 1964</a>), but such autonomy does not exist in all firms (<a href=\"#bib17\">Love, Priem, &amp; Lumpkin, 2002</a>). The United States government consists of various federal, state, and local departments with overlapping jurisdictions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Liesbet &amp; Gary, 2003</a>). The North Korean government is presumably largely centrally organized with organs like the \u201cCentral People\u2019s Committee\u201d and the \u201cState Planning Committee\u201d. As to how the structure of an economic system affects its performance is a fundamental theoretical question with a bearing on the microstructure of markets, the internal organization of firms, and the structure of governments.",

The coordination problem is to order the agents according to their numbers, with the least numbered agent on left and highest numbered on the right. In the centralized system, agents communicate their numbers to a central authority, who uses the information to order the agents. In the decentralized system, agents communicate their numbers to neighbours and swap positions if the number of the agent on left is more than the number of the agent on right. Agents probabilistically make errors in communicating private information in the centralized system and the decentralized system. We find that the decentralized system is more robust to communication errors than the centralized system. This is because the centralized system of coordination involves a strong-dependence between the information communicated by constituent parts (<a href=\"#bib26\">Simon, 1962</a>). Errors in the information communicated by one agent to the central-coordinator negatively affects the usefulness of the information communicated by other agents to the central-coordinator. The decentralized system on the other hand involves weak-dependence between the information communicated by constituent parts. Errors in the information communicated by one agent to its neighbour has a negligible effect on the usefulness of the information communicated by other agents to their neighbours. The localization of decision-making in the decentralized system limits the impact of communication errors on the system\u2019s performance. The strong-dependence between the information communicated by different agents in the centralized system and the weak-dependence in the decentralized system is a consequence of the difference in structure of communication and decision-making in the two systems.",

Imagine placing your hand in a tub of water at 80\u00b0C. There are two ways to communicate this information from the nerve endings in your hand to your brain. One way is to convey the temperature in binary form. Another way is the counting method, where one count is communicated for each 1\u00b0C. Interestingly, the human nervous system uses a mechanism roughly akin to the counting method. This despite the fact that the counting method involves communicating orders of magnitude more information than the binary method. <a href=\"#bib30\">Von Neumann (1951</a>, p. 101) speculates on why the human nervous system uses the counting method: \u201c...the counting method has a high stability and safety from error. If you express a number of the order of million by counting and miss a count, the result is only irrelevantly changed. If you express it by (decimal or binary) expansion, a single error in a single digit may vitiate the entire result.\u201d",

The usefulness of correct information conveyed by all other digits is vitiated by a single error. In contrast to the binary method, in the counting method the absence of a count has a negligible effect on the usefulness of the other counts. If a count is missed, the temperature conveyed is 79\u00b0C. There is strong-dependence among the digits in the binary method, but weak-dependence among the counts in the counting method. The principle of strong and weak dependence are at play in centralized and decentralized systems, and is the cause of the greater robustness of the decentralized system to communication errors.",

The literature on the architecture of economic systems began with the socialist calculation debate between Otto Neurath and Ludwig von Mises, though the modern strand originates from the contributions of Hayek and Lange. <a href=\"#bib13\">Hayek (1945)</a> claimed the market system is superior to communist central planning in using dispersed information to coordinate the activities of different agents. <a href=\"#bib15\">Lange (1936)</a> argued central planning can attain efficient allocation of resources by mimicking the price system. While the relative advantages of price, shadow-price, and non-price mechanisms of coordination are important, \u201cthere is more at stake in the choice of an economic system\u201d (<a href=\"#bib25\">Sah &amp; Stiglitz, 1986</a>, p. 726). One of the differences between centralized and decentralized economic systems is how they perform in the presence of communication errors. The difference between the Soviet centrally planned economy and the US economy is not only one of the extent to which they use price signals to communicate economic information, but also the structures through which they communicate information. These structures influence the performance of the two systems when economic signals contain noise.",

Bolton and Farrell argue that decentralization involves duplication and delay. We too find decentralization involves delay, but for a reason different from Bolton and Farrell\u2019s. In our model, the decentralized system takes more time than the centralized system because the decentralized system has to muddle through numerous local communications and decision-making. In Bolton and Farrell\u2019s model, delay occurs because agents do not communicate with each other in the decentralized system. <a href=\"#bib11\">Guerini <i>et al</i>. (2016)</a> study the macroeconomic performance of a centralized and a decentralized protocol of search and matching.

Our paper shares some ingredients with these papers, while differing from them in important respects. In <a href=\"#bib28\">Stein (2002)</a> model agents do not communicate private information in the decentralized system. In <a href=\"#bib1\">Acemoglu <i>et al</i>. (2007)</a> model agents do not communicate private information in the centralized system. In contrast to Stein and Acemoglu <i>et al</i>., we study the differences in the performance of centralized and decentralized systems due to the differences in their structures of communication and decision-making. <a href=\"#bib18\">Maskin <i>et al</i>.

Our paper studies the differences in performance of systems even when their structures do not influence incentives. Matters other than incentives matter. All this means that even when our conclusions concur with those of other papers in the literature, the reasoning behind the conclusions differ. For instance, <a href=\"#bib28\">Stein (2002)</a> concludes decentralization is preferable when information is difficult to communicate. This is similar to our conclusion that decentralization is preferable when there is a greater likelihood of communication errors. After all, information is difficult to communicate when there are communication errors. However, the reasoning behind Stein\u2019s conclusion differs from ours. In Stein\u2019s case, decentralization is preferable when information is difficult to communicate because no communication is necessary in the decentralized system. In our case, decentralization is preferable when information is difficult to communicate because the localization of communication limits the consequences of communication errors on the system\u2019s performance. Our contribution to the literature on firms is that the internal structure of firms matters because it determines the robustness of firms to employees\u2019 communication errors and the speed with which firms can coordinate the activities of its employees.",

The contribution by <a href=\"#bib22\">Ostrom <i>et al</i>. (1961)</a> sparked an interesting literature on the origin and performance of alternate structures of government. This literature studied a variety of ways in which structure affects performance, including the relation between norms and governance structures (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ostrom, 1999</a>), and the influence of government structure on incentives to truthfully reveal information (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bendor <i>et al</i>., 2001</a>). Our analysis suggests that the structure of government influences performance, even when the structure does not influence social norms and incentives. Most governments have a rich and intricate framework for negotiation and adjudication between different agencies. Negotiation and adjudication involves error-prone communication. Our model suggests that the structure of government influences its robustness to error-prone communication between different agencies and the speed with which governments can execute tasks.

The first agent does not have a left neighbour and the last agent does not have a right neighbour. There are two ways to order the agents: a centralized system and a decentralized system. In the centralized system, each agent conveys its number to a central-coordinator. The central-coordinator orders the agents on a line segment. For instance, if an agent communicates its number as 3, the central-coordinator places the agent in position 3 on the line segment. The central-coordinator orders the agents as the agents communicate their numbers to the central-coordinator. The decentralized system works differently. Each time step, pairs of neighbouring agents are randomly selected. Within each pair, agents share information about each other\u2019s numbers.

Better communication technology allows for more accurate communication of information. This is equivalent to a decrease in communication errors in our model and consequent improvement in the relative performance of the centralized system. Perhaps this explains the emergence of behemoths like Walmart (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bowersox &amp; Daugherty, 1995</a>).

He argues that democratic societies have better internal conflict management mechanisms and therefore do not amplify external shocks as much as autocratic societies. Our paper provides an alternate explanation. We believe autocratic societies are less robust to communication errors of constituent parts than democratic societies because autocratic societies use more centralized decision-making than democratic societies. The greater variability and consequent extreme events in autocratic societies emerge from the way autocratic societies use dispersed information. In contrast to Rodrik\u2019s model, our model predicts that autocratic societies will exhibit greater variance than democratic societies even in the absence of external shocks.",

This is perhaps why one does not find massage parlours with thousands of employees. <a href=\"#bib28\">Stein (2002)</a> presents evidence on how smaller banks provide relationship based small-business lending and larger banks provide services that involve easy to communicate information.

But perhaps the greatest of omissions is an analysis of the relation between decentralization and the price system. Most economists believe markets are more decentralized than firms and governments (<a href=\"#bib5\">Axtell, 2003</a>). Markets involve the use of the price system. Why does the most common form of decentralized coordination nearly always use the price system? Our hypothesis is that the price system decreases the time necessary to create coordination but makes markets less robust to communication errors. The price system is akin to a global telecommunication system which allows agents in one part of the system to know <i>something</i> about the plans of agents in other parts (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hayek, 1945</a>). The price system decreases the time necessary for a decentralized system to produce coordination because prices tell agents more than what they learn from local interactions. With the price system fewer local interactions are necessary for coordination than without the price system. However, the price system also increases the dependence between the information communicated by different agents.",

An increase in the dependence of the information communicated by different agents decreases the robustness of markets to communication errors. The influence of the price system on the robustness of markets is intricately linked to the business cycle phenomena. Exploring the relation between decentralization, the price system, and their consequence on aggregate fluctuations is a fruitful area for future research.",
