                "text": "The ageing of the population and its consequences is widely recognised as one of the major public policy challenges facing Australia, with likely future retirement incomes emerging as a key policy issue. In such debates, the future fortunes of women loom large. Will compulsory employer contributions to superannuation make a difference to the financial position of women in retirement? Will increased labour force participation result in a better retirement? What of the women who were relying on their partner\u2019s superannuation but their marriage has ended in divorce? Models established to date do not provide the best tools to answer questions such as those above. In particular, they are unable to cope with the impact of divorce. With this in mind, NATSEM, with support from an Australian Research Council grant (A79906127), has added a superannuation module onto an existing microsimulation model. This new model allows detailed distributional analysis of future retirement incomes, including analysis of a wide range of policy settings and of the impact on future superannuation of behavioural changes. This paper presents the first, preliminary results using this model.",

A key issue is the likely private incomes of future retirees and the extent to which governments will be willing and/or able to support the living standards of retirees, through the provision of the age pension, subsidised health care, and so on. The need for governments to urgently make decisions in this regard is highlighted by the fact that the first of the baby boomers are turning 55 this year.

The male members of superannuation funds, for example, already enjoy assets almost three times greater than the female members (<a href=\"#bib5\">Goward, 1997, p. <span class=\"page-number\">3</span></a>). There is also concern that occupational superannuation and social security policy are not well integrated, with the Superannuation Guarantee Charge (SGC) possibly being of marginal benefit to women if it simply replaces the age pension (<a href=\"#bib7\">Knox, 1994</a>). An additional major issue is the treatment of superannuation upon divorce where, typically, divorce has a very detrimental effect upon a women\u2019s future retirement income. Many women who are at home raising children or working in low-paid part-time jobs assume that they will enjoy a comfortable retirement because of their husband\u2019s superannuation. But now that one-third of marriages end in divorce, for a very substantial proportion such an assumption may not prove correct.",

There is concern about the likely cost of such support to the taxpayer, particularly as the ageing baby boomers can be expected to also generate significant public health costs. If fiscal pressures upon the government increase, the extent to which any shift from public to private support is feasible will depend critically upon the future incomes and assets of the aged, and the willingness of the aged to draw upon them to meet their own needs.",

The extent of diversity is thus effectively constrained by the number and type of groups specified. Moreover, there is usually no scope for people in the model to move from one group to another.

The dynamic model, DYNAMOD, begins with the 1986 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) one per cent Census sample file. Onto the individuals on this file are imputed additional characteristics (such as more detail on the level and type of education being undertaken, the state in which the person lives, the value of the family home, etc). The result is a base population of 150,000 synthetic individuals with over 80 characteristics each. The model takes this base population and simulates their lives from 1986 onwards, by stepping month-by-month through time until the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. As the individuals step through life, they experience a range of life events, in line with Australian data about the probabilities of those events happening to real Australians. The life events include death; fertility; couple formation and dissolution; emigration and immigration; primary, secondary and tertiary education; labour force changes (full and part-time employment, unemployment and NILF), disability onset and recovery, and the earning of income.",

Additionally, individuals in the model are linked to simulate couple formation and the links broken to simulate couple dissolution. Links are maintained between parents and their children and between current and ex-spouses. In this manner, the model maintains the diversity in the population, copes very well with couple formation and dissolution, and, importantly, allows generation of a longitudinal history (or future) for individual cases in the model. This longitudinal element is essential in order to capture the accumulation processes that underlie growth in superannuation and financial assets. Alternative futures can be simulated by varying particular probabilities, such as the chance of becoming full-time employed or of having a first child, given certain characteristics. The model also contains a capacity to make the summed outcomes for all individuals within the model fit some exogenously imposed total. For example, the proportion of all women of a certain age range that are to be employed full-time in 2010 can be set by the user.",

The accuracy of the modelling, naturally, depends on the availability of good quality data. For dynamic microsimulation there is an additional need and that is for very detailed and preferably longitudinal or panel data. Unfortunately the data available on superannuation holdings in Australia are limited. A significant step forward will be the release later this year of the confidentialised unit record or micro data from the 2000 ABS superannuation survey. At the present time, the major source of superannuation asset data is a survey of major private superannuation funds conducted by RIM in the early 1990s (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brown, 1994</a>).

The latter of these, with its compulsory employer contributions for every employee earning more than $450 per month, is having a dramatic impact on the coverage of superannuation. The ABS estimated in 1993 that 50.3 percent of all Australians aged 15 \u2013 74 were covered by superannuation and 80.5 percent of those employed were covered. In 2000, ABS estimated 87.7 percent of people aged 15 to 54 with one or more jobs had superannuation coverage. While not directly comparable it does indicate the strong upward trend. Superannuation coverage simulated using DYNAMOD shows growth from an estimated 45.9 percent in 1993 to 84.4 percent in 2000 for all people aged 15 \u2013 74 \u2014 again a very strong upward trend. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> shows the projected growth in coverage over the period 1993 to 2030. These figures cover all people aged 15-74 except full-time school students, rather than just those employed. A significant feature of these projections, done using DYNAMOD, is the estimate that by 2000 almost all people in some age groups were covered by superannuation. While the ABS estimates for 2000 are a little lower than this (the ABS estimates were in the low 90s), it is clear that SGC is well on its way to ensuring that everyone is covered by superannuation. The definition of \u2018covered\u2019 used in DYNAMOD means that anyone who has any amount in a superannuation fund is covered. It does not exclude those not currently making a contribution. (For example a person may contribute to superannuation while employed, then leave the labour force for a period to care for children.) Under the DYNAMOD definition the person is covered by superannuation. To qualify a person only needs to make one contribution (or have their employer make one contribution) and they are then regarded as \u2018covered\u2019 until retirement. In the real world, it is quite possible that a person has some superannuation from past employment but is not aware of it. This may have lead to some underreporting in the ABS data.",

In the two comparisons, the population in 1991 (dark colour) is compared with 30 and 60 years later, while the percentage of the population is presented in five year age groups from 0 to 85 and 85+. In 1991 the largest groups were the three groups covering ages 20-35 (ie born from 1956-1971), with a fairly clear decrease in the percentages above that age. The age group 85+ represented only 0.9% of the population (0.25% males and 0.63% females). By 2021 the peak age groups will have flattened and become broader. The 1991 Christmas tree shape has transformed into a more rectangular one. There is now a fairly even distribution of people between the ages of 20-65. The average age has increased and the proportion aged 85+ has more than doubled to 2.0%.",

The first is that since marriage started at an older age, it will finish at an older age. The assumption here is that marriages are of the same duration. In fact, the duration of marriages increased slightly over the period 1988-98 \u2013 by 0.5 years to 7.8 years (ABS 4102.0). The end result of getting married 2-3 years later and the marriage lasting 6 months longer would have the impact of moving the age distribution curve to the right as we see in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. A second or alternative reason for the movement in the curve is the ageing discussed in the previous paragraph. While on average women still outlive men, the ageing of both genders causes wives to become widows at a later age. This trend can be seen in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. The proportion of females who are widows decreases between 1990 and 2030/2050.",

This wide disparity was evident throughout the 1990s, despite a significant growth overall in part-time employment for both genders (the overall proportion employed part-time rose from 20.9% in 1990 to 26.0% in 1999). Labour force participation rates are also quite different when compared on a gender basis. The female participation rate rose by to 2.0 percentage points to 53.9 percent in the 1990s while the male participation rate fell 2.7 to 72.8 percent over the same period. In some age groups the difference was even greater. For example, the participation rate trend for 55-59 year old men is slowly downwards (from 75.0% to 73.2% in the 1990s), while the trend for women of the same age is rapidly upwards (up from 32.4% at the start of the 1990s to 43.6% at the end) (ABS 4102.0 pp. 109).",

As discussed in the section <i>Coverage Projection</i> (page 11) almost everyone will have had superannuation contributions made on their behalf by retirement because of the government\u2019s SGC policy. The amount that will be held in this superannuation account will depend on three factors \u2013 the rate of return of the superannuation fund, the contributions made into the account, and taxation on the superannuation. The last of these, taxation, is not part of NATSEM\u2019s modelling at this stage. The SGC employer contributions are a percentage of earnings, the higher the earnings and the longer the time in employment, the greater the superannuation assets. In most cases a working life spent in full-time, high salary employment and not interrupted by any periods of unemployment or NILF would produce the highest superannuation. This set of circumstances is most likely to achieved by males \u2014 and it is for this reason that average female superannuation amounts were only 45% of those of males in 1993. However, the increasing age of marriage and childbirth, reduced periods of NILF for child raising purposes, and the increased use of part-time employment are having a positive effect. Female superannuation is increasing as a proportion of male superannuation, and is estimated by DYNAMOD to reach 70 percent by 2030. Unless there is complete equality in the labour force roles, the female proportion will remain lower than the male, due partly to lower female earnings and different workforce participation patterns in the child bearing and rearing years.",

The impact of compound growth is evident in the figure. In 1993 few women had contributed to superannuation in the early part of their working life and hence the balance in their superannuation account did not grow through interest being paid and added each year. In comparison, by 2030 most women will have made superannuation contributions at the start of their working life. For the next 30-40 years that contribution will have been added to each year through interest. This, combined with more years of employment than the previous generation\u2019s, results in exponential growth in the value of the asset.",

At the same time the government\u2019s Age Pension provides a maximum income of 25 percent of the average total male earnings. If we make the not unreasonable assumption that the average total male earnings is the average pre-retirement income, those with only the age pension will have an income of 25 percent when they would like 60 percent to be comfortable. We assume people would like their superannuation to make up the other 35 percent required reach the comfortable level. It does not appear this will be the case for the majority of women. Consider women aged 55-64 in 2030 on the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile, if they invested their $93,000 superannuation at 5%, it will produce an annual income of $4,650 - approximately 11% of average earnings (in May 1999). The same calculation for those in this age group with the median $183,600 would add 23%. However, for those at the median, an asset of this size is certainly sufficient to begin affecting the age pension entitlements, via either the income or assets tests.",

Unfortunately, there is limited data available on superannuation holdings in Australia and superannuation holdings for every person in 1986 are certainly not available. Superannuation funds, in general, are private organisations and hence details on individual holdings are not generally available. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has periodically collected data on superannuation, but the majority of their data relates to coverage and annual contributions rather than actual holdings. The reason for ABS not collecting data on actual holdings is clearly based on the unreliability of such data. Until the late 1990s, most people did not know the value of their accumulated funds and they often had more than one account.",

Firstly, there are some 213,747 superannuation funds in Australia (APRA June 2000). Of these, 211,175 have less than five members. This number of small funds makes calculation of an overall rate of return for superannuation funds difficult and perhaps meaningless, as it is possible that a number of these small funds are not motivated by maximising returns over the long term. Exclusion of these small funds reduces the total assets by only 15% (down $68B to $409B) and should allow the rate of return of the remaining major funds to be calculated. However, a second problem with measuring rates of returns then becomes evident - rates of return can still not be accurately obtained as the superannuation industry\u2019s \u2018reserving\u2019 practice. Reserving involves paying a smaller rate of return in good years and putting the extra funds aside for use when the actual rate of return is negative or low. A number of superannuation funds use reserving to implement a policy of not passing on negative returns. In years when the actual return is negative or zero, the reserve is used to pay a small positive return. The practice of using reserves results in a smoothing of rates and makes measurement of actual real returns very difficult to obtain.",
