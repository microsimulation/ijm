Second, we respond, albeit in a simple way, to the recommendation of <a href=\"#bib3\">Bourguignon and Perreira (2003)</a> to integrate \u201creal\u201d households within a CGE framework rather than using representative households. Third, by providing applications to Nepal and the Philippines, we demonstrate that this technique is straightforward to implement and requires only a standard CGE model and a nationally representative household survey with information on household income and consumption.",

One reason is the proliferation of nationally representative household surveys with detailed income information over the course of the decade. Another is that, until recently, CGE modellers have generally shown little interest in the distributive impacts of policies\u2014preferring to focus on welfare effects in terms of equivalent variation (EV) or compensating variation (CV). Nonetheless, the use of CGE models complemented with household survey data is now recognized as well-suited to identifying the mechanisms by which macro-economic shocks affect poverty and income distribution (<a href=\"#bib23\">Winters <i>et al</i>. 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hertel &amp; Reimer 2005</a>).",

(2004)</a>, makes use of \u201crepresentative\u201d households rather than actual/real households. Distributive impacts are simply captured through extending the disaggregation of the representative households in order to identify as many household categories, generally corresponding to different socio-economic groups, as possible. This approach makes it possible to analyze the impacts of policies on incomes and welfare between groups (inter-group distribution) but not within groups as intra-household distribution is assumed to be fixed. It provides information neither on poverty impacts (as the poor may be found in many different socio-economic groups and in varying proportions) nor on intra-group distribution. In order to address the first limitation, some authors have applied a fixed income distribution function among households within each household group in order to compute poverty indices (such as the FGT indices). One way is to assume a log-normal distribution, where the variance is estimated from the base year data (<a href=\"#bib11\">De Janvry <i>et al</i>., 1991</a>). Meanwhile, <a href=\"#bib9\">Decaluw\u00e9 <i>et al</i>. (2000)</a> argue that a beta distribution is preferable to other distributions because it can be skewed to the left or right and thus may better represent the types of income distributions commonly observed within household groups. Yet, <a href=\"#bib2\">Boccanfuso <i>et al</i>. (2003)</a> underscore the difficulty of using restrictive functional forms as distribution could change before and after simulations, and large variations in poverty indices may arise depending on the functional form employed.",

Income underreporting and measurement errors are likely to result from the desire to hide revenues from other family members, neighbours or eventual tax authorities, as well as from the long (usually one-year) recall periods involved for intricate sources of income such as returns to assets, agricultural output and seasonal activities. This is further aggravated by the fact that most households in developing countries receive their income from informal production activities in which family income and business revenues are often combined. Thus, the absence of formal accounting in these activities and within the household make it impossible to constitute an accurate picture of the income of producer households and often lead to underestimated income (or overestimated expenditures) generated by these activities.",

A first comparison of the aggregate household income/expenditure vectors from the survey and the SAM make it possible to evaluate the magnitude and direction of divergences in each of the income and expenditure accounts. There are a variety of reasons why the two sets of vectors will not match. If the initial SAM is based on a previous household survey, it is normal that household endowments and behavior would have changed over time. If instead it is drawn solely from national accounts, the margin for divergences is even greater. Some errors may stem from survey measurement and/or sampling errors.

The opportunity cost of labour is computed by the mean hourly implicit wage for each socio-professional categories adjusted by their respective unemployment rates. This reflects the fact that individuals will engage in self-employment either because they cannot find paid work in their profession or their expected wage from self-employment exceeds those offered in the market. The share of returns to land from agricultural self-employment was estimated by computing the mean regional rental price of land. The value of capital share from self-employment was computed residually as the difference between net revenue and the estimated costs of all other factors used in this activity. <i>NLSS Step 3 (negative capital income):</i> In cases where households reported negative capital income from self-employment, this was deemed unrealistic and the values were set to zero. This correction reduced the share of households with negative savings from 40 to 26 percent. <i>NLSS Step 4 (inter-household transfers):</i> For all remaining household with negative savings, we assumed that this was due to the failure of the NLSS to capture intra-household transfers. Thus intransfers were increased just enough to bring savings to zero for these households, where these in-transfers are financed through a proportional increase in out-transfers from all households with positive reported savings.",

A comparison of income and expenditure vectors from both datasets revealed that household income and expenditure in the NLSS was still understated relative to the SAM in spite of the preceding adjustments. This could be due to various causes such as the omission of households lacking information on incomes, expenditures and/or other socio-economic variables from the NLSS, as well as the 2.4 percent population growth and 7.8 percent inflation between the year of the NLSS (1995/96) and the year of theS AM (1996/97). Consequently, the income and expenditure vectors generated from the survey were increased proportionally to match SAM values. Regional savings rates rates still remained above corresponding SAM values, which we attribute to possible over-estimation of the opportunity cost of factors used in self-employment activities. These values are thus adjusted proportionally to reconcile the SAM and survey savings rates. The aggregate survey income and expenditure vectors were then substituted into the SAM and all remaining minor imbalances were corrected through a least squares SAM balancing procedure.",

The \u201cbridging\u201d reconciliation rules are similar to Nepal, except that no imputation was carried out to estimate for the market equivalent prices of factors (labour and capital) used in self-employment activities. Since factor incomes and transfers for the entire family are assigned to the household head, recovering income earnings for each family member and undertaking imputation exercises on the basis of the characteristics of the household head may alter the survey structure significantly. Instead, self-employment income was directly allocated to capital income. Moreover, no adjustment for inflation was required as income and expenditure data were both collected at the same time in two rounds of visits at six months interval. Nonetheless, inter-household in-transfers were increased proportionally, as there total was inferior to total in-transfers.",

The second adjustment was on total labour income and total capital income, which are, respectively, 40 and 38 percent higher in the SAM. Since both datasets are for the same year, this reconciliation process was straightforward with survey values normalized to SAM totals, implying that capital and labour income for each household was increased proportionally.

Since import-weighted average tariff rates are higher in agriculture, import prices (PM) fall more, and import volumes (M) increase proportionately more in agriculture than in industry. However, as import competition (intensity) is greater in the industrial sector, domestic prices for locally-produced goods (PD and, net of taxes, PL) and consumer prices (PQ) fall more in the industrial sector, whereas they rest almost constant for services, which are not imported. At the same time, faced with a fixed current account balance, rising imports lead to a real exchange rate devaluation and an expansion in exports. Industrial exports (EX) expand more than agricultural and service exports since industry is more export-oriented. Industry also benefits more from falling imported input costs which, together with the depreciating real exchange rate, make domestic industrial products more competitive in the international market. The net impact is a slight reduction in output (XS) in the inward oriented agricultural sector in favour of the service sector and the outward oriented industrial sector. Output prices (PX) also fall less in industry than in agriculture, despite the greater reduction in prices for domestic sales (PL), given industry\u2019s greater export intensity, where export prices are assumed to be constant.",

The service sector, which is unaffected by import tariff liberalization, emerges with the smallest reduction in value added prices.

Overall, the national poverty headcount index falls marginally, whereas both the national poverty gap and severity index increase marginally, implying that the poor become even poorer (<a href=\"#table5\">Table 5</a>). Indeed, the poor are overwhelmingly concentrated in rural areas and thus hit hardest by the fall in agricultural income. A clear pro-urban bias in the poverty results emerges as all poverty indices fall significantly in the National Capital region and compare favourably among other urban households relatively to rural households, for whom all poverty indices increase. Households with highly educated heads also benefit more from tariff reductions than their counterparts with low educated heads, given their greater relative reliance on non-factor and non-agricultural income and skilled wages. Moreover, poverty falls dramatically among households headed by highly educated females given their high share of income from non-factor and non-agricultural sources. As the underlying data is available at the individual household level, analysis by other socio-economic categories would, of course, straightforward.",

This gives us a much more detailed view of how the impacts of trade liberalization vary over the whole income distribution. These figures show that results are very sensitive to the choice of poverty line. While there is some evidence of a slight reduction in the number of the very poorest (under 900 rupees, or $US 43, per capita annual income), the number of moderately poor increases as a result of trade liberalisation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).
