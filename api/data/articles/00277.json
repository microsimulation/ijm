                "text": "With around a million people \u2013 or 6% of the population \u2013 living below the threshold, poverty remains a tenacious problem in the Netherlands. It is especially prevalent among children, migrants and the very elderly. Planned policies, if implemented, will cause poverty to rise by 28% over the next decades, everything else equal. We use two microsimulation models to estimate the effects of various tax-benefit policies and four larger reforms on poverty. To estimate the costs of implementing these policies and reforms, we also document their effects on employment, income inequality and the government budget. The results indicate that reducing poverty is possible but involves considerable costs in terms of public money and/or jobs. Introducing a budget-neutral universal basic income at the level of the state pension reduces poverty by 60% but requires very high income tax rates and reduces employment by 8%. Other policy options are cheaper but generate smaller reductions in poverty. These findings demonstrate the social trilemma faced by policymakers in modern welfare states: to simultaneously provide adequate minimum income support, maintain sufficient financial incentives for people to find a job, \u00e1nd keep the government budget in check. This has become increasingly difficult due to slow wage growth at the bottom of the earnings distribution. However, we also find important differences in cost efficiency. Of the policies with a budgetary impact of 1 billion euros, increasing minimum income support achieves the largest reduction in poverty. Raising the means-tested child budget is a relatively efficient way of reducing child poverty.",

In fact, if implemented, planned policies will cause poverty to rise by more than a quarter over the next decades, everything else equal (<a href=\"#bib44\">Olsthoorn et al., 2020</a>). In the short term, the steep rise in consumer prices puts further pressure on the standard of living, in particular for those at the bottom of the income distribution. While this is expected to increase poverty in 2022, the extensive support package of the Dutch government is expected to (at least temporarily) mitigate these effects in 2023 (<a href=\"#bib17\">CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, 2022</a>).<a href=\"#fn1\"><sup>1</sup></a>",

When zooming into the specific aspects of our analysis, it primarily relates to a growing literature that uses microsimulation methods to assess the effects of a range of tax-benefit policies on the distribution of income. Examples include <a href=\"#bib33\">Immervoll et al. (2006)</a> and <a href=\"#bib3\">Atkinson et al. (2017)</a>.<a href=\"#fn3\"><sup>3</sup></a> Some of our findings also speak directly to studies that focus on one particular reform, such as raising minimum income benefit or introducing a basic income (see for example <a href=\"#bib5\">Browne and Immervoll, 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2022</a> and <a href=\"#bib40\">Martinelli, 2019</a>). In this respect, the studies by <a href=\"#bib4\">Boone et al. (2018)</a> and <a href=\"#bib2\">Aerts et al. (2021)</a> that simulate the effects of introducing a basic income are of particular interest because of their shared focus on the Netherlands. The primary contribution of this study is that it simulates a broader range of antipoverty policies and compares their impact and cost efficiency. We briefly compare our main findings to those of earlier studies in the concluding section.",

While aimed at providing social assistance in a cost-efficient manner, they have also made the system complex and opaque. It is notoriously difficult for households to assess the consequences of a change in gross income for their net disposable income. As a result, various aspects of the system are the subject of fierce public debate, particularly the allowance scheme, which we describe below.",

It provides an income and assets tested safety net of last resort and tops up existing income, if any, so as to ensure that recipients receive the <i>social minimum</i>. The benefit is conditional, as recipients have to meet a number of requirements, such as actively searching for work and engaging in community service as a compensatory activity. The amounts vary with a person\u2019s age and living situation and constitute the government norm for a minimum existence.<a href=\"#fn4\"><sup>4</sup></a> They are updated twice a year based on changes in the <i>reference minimum wage</i>. This is the net income of a couple in the hypothetical situation that one of them receives a before tax benefit equal to the <i>statutory gross minimum wage</i> including holiday supplement, while the other receives nothing (and the pair does not have any other income).<a href=\"#fn5\"><sup>5</sup></a> In practice, the benefit amounts constitute fixed proportions of this reference minimum wage. For working age singles aged above 21 without cost-sharing residents, the net amount equals 70% of the reference minimum wage. This percentage increases with the number of co-residents above the age of 21 but less than proportionally because larger households are assumed to realise economies of scale. As an example, couples receive 100% of the reference minimum wage, while a couple with a 25-year old child living at home receives 130%. No extra benefit is paid for minor children but child allowance and child budget are added to the norm amounts of their households.<a href=\"#fn6\"><sup>6</sup></a>",

Moreover, households have to apply in order to receive the funds and the Dutch tax authority typically only checks much later whether the stated income is correct. The main advantage of this approach is that people who experience financial problems can quickly get support. The disadvantages are a non-take up rate of 10% and ex-post downward revisions of almost half of all awarded allowances. Such downward revisions increasingly leave households with excessively high levels of debt. They also contribute to ex-ante income uncertainty among allowance beneficiaries, as people feel increasingly insecure about whether the funds are actually theirs. It has become clear that the allowance system can also be a cause of poverty rather than a tool to prevent it. In light of these problems, the system has come under severe criticism for its complexity and inaccessibility. The call for a simpler system grew even louder after it became public that the Dutch tax authority had wrongly accused thousands of households of child care allowance fraud and demanded huge repayments. In January 2021, these problems led the Dutch government to resign.",

The questions of how well-being should be interpreted and what minimum level constitutes a reasonable threshold are the subjects of long-standing academic debates (e.g. <a href=\"#bib47\">Rawls, 1999</a>; Sen, 1999; and Ravallion, 2016). In this paper, we employ the <i>generalised reference budget approach</i> developed by the SCP and used since 2007 to measure poverty in the Netherlands (<a href=\"#bib51\">Vrooman et al., 2020</a>). According to this approach, an individual agent is poor if he or she consistently lacks the means to obtain the minimum necessities of his community. In practice, this definition is operationalised by comparing someone\u2019s annual disposable income to a budget-based poverty threshold. Two reference budgets are compiled. The first variant, the <i>basic needs</i> budget, includes the expenses that can be viewed as minimum necessities in the Netherlands. These include items that are difficult to avoid such as food, clothing, housing and various others. The second variant, the <i>modest-but-adequate</i> budget, is somewhat less conservative and also contains the minimum expenditures on recreation and social participation. Both budgets are for the most part derived from expert data of the National Institute for Family Finance Information (Nibud) and have been validated through the use of consensual focus groups (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hoff et al., 2010</a>). <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a> lists the items and amounts for a single-person household in 2017. According to the basic needs criterion, the poverty threshold amounted to \u20ac1,039 per month. According to the modest-but-adequate criterion, it stood at \u20ac1,135 per month. Thresholds for other household types are derived by applying the equivalence scale of Statistics Netherlands (<a href=\"#bib48\">Siermann et al., 2004</a>). Since the modest-but-adequate criterion was deemed most appropriate in the focus groups, this is the one we use in our analysis.",

Statistics Netherlands (CBS) biennially reports estimates based on its <i>low income threshold</i> (<a href=\"#bib8\">CBS, 2021</a>).

The European Union instead uses the <i>at-risk-of-poverty (AROP) threshold</i>, which is fully relative and amounts to 60 percent of median disposable income (<a href=\"#bib39\">Besharov and Couch, 2012</a>). A disadvantage of these alternative methods is that they are not based on an actual assessment of what is minimally necessary in the Netherlands. In addition, the fixed (constant price) character of the low income threshold also raises doubts, as the Netherlands has become considerably more prosperous over the past decades and the norms for a minimum existence have presumably increased as well. The EU\u2019s AROP threshold <i>does</i> reflect changes in prosperity but determines poverty solely by comparing someone\u2019s income to the median and is often seen more as an inequality measure (<a href=\"#bib18\">Darvas, 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Van Praag and Ferrer-i-Carbonell, 2004</a>).

The first three policy options listed in <a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a> are specifically targeted at single parents and large families. In particular, the first option raises the (means tested) child budget amounts for the third and any subsequent children up to the point where they match the amount paid for the second child. The results show that this option costs \u20ac 0.2 bn and reduces the incidence and intensity of poverty in the general population by 2.5% and 1.1%, respectively. When we focus only on children, the estimated reductions in poverty are 7.2% and 3.4%. Employment and income inequality show small estimated declines, although the employment effect disappears due to rounding. The small impact on employment is representative for child policies more generally, which contribute to the costs of children but do not fundamentally alter the relative payoff of paid work vis-\u00e0-vis other activities. Overall, despite its complexity and its small adverse effect on labour market incentives, raising the child budget for large families is a relatively cost efficient way of reducing child poverty.",

Policy option 5 in <a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a> makes the in-work tax credit refundable, analogous to the <i>Earned Income Tax Credit</i> (EITC) in the US. This primarily helps families with low earnings from work because they are the ones who currently pay insufficient income tax to fully benefit from the tax credit. It also means that the marginal tax rate on income from work at the lower end of the income distribution becomes lower, which increases the incentives for benefit recipients to find a job. Implementing this option costs \u20ac 0.3 bn. Overall poverty declines by 0.8%, while in-work poverty falls by 1.1% (both in terms of the incidence and in terms of the intensity of poverty).

Eventually, when earnings surpass the threshold of around \u20ac 35,000, the amount starts slowly decreasing until it reaches zero. Policy option 6 proposes to let the fast build-up of the amount of in-work tax credit start from zero earnings rather than from the threshold of \u20ac 10,000. This costs \u20ac 1.2 bn and reduces the incidence and intensity of poverty by 3.1% and 1.7%, respectively. For in-work poverty these effects amount to 8.8% and 4.5%. Because the maximum amount of tax credit is now reached at a lower level of earnings, it becomes more attractive to work fewer hours. As a result, the policy option comes at the expense of a small reduction in employment. Income inequality is expected to fall by 0.4%. Policy option 7 represents a combination of options 5 and 6 but generates effects that are larger than the sum of the individual effects, which illustrates that the options mutually reinforce each other considerably.",

Our baseline simulation, which does not account for behavioural responses, indicates that this policy option costs \u20ac 1.4 bn.

This is likely to have non-negligible effects on people\u2019s labour market decisions. <a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a> therefore also reports the simulated budgetary impact (\u20ac 2.9 bn) that results when we add the expected fiscal consequences of such changes in behaviour. The estimated effects of this policy option are considerable. The share of people living below the poverty line falls by 20.0%, while their total income shortfall declines by 8.8%. For benefit recipients specifically, it would even eradicate more than half of existing poverty, both in terms of people and money. As pointed out, the policy option is likely to affect labour market participation and hence employment is expected to drop by 0.9%. Income inequality also falls by 0.9%.",

Since the baseline scenario assumes that all planned policies, including the gradual decline of the minimum income benefit, have been fully implemented, this policy option represents an <i>increase</i> in minimum income support, relative to counterfactual. The budgetary effect is smaller than for option 8 and amounts to \u20ac 0.9 bn (\u20ac 1.9 bn when we account for changes in behaviour). The effects on poverty are also somewhat smaller.

Poverty among people of retirement age is very low in the Netherlands, due to the relatively generous state pension. However, not everybody is fully entitled to this pension, as it depends on the years resided in the Netherlands. In addition, some of the elderly face considerable health-related expenditures which can also push them below the poverty line. Policy option 11 makes the tax credit for retirees refundable. The tax credit for retirees is a fixed income tax discount of around \u20ac 1,600 for retirees with incomes up to \u20ac 37,000. Above that threshold, the discount starts decreasing until it reaches zero at an income of around \u20ac 48,000. For retirees with low taxable incomes, the amount of income tax can be insufficient to be able to fully use the available tax credit. Policy option 11 makes the tax credit for retirees refundable so that it is always fully used. This raises the income of retirees at the bottom of the income distribution. The option costs \u20ac 0.8 bn and lowers poverty in the general population by 1.7% (incidence) and 2.2% (intensity). These effects are larger among the elderly: 10.0% and 14.6%, respectively. Income inequality is reduced by 0.4%. Any effects on employment are likely to be negligible because of the low labour market participation of the elderly population. Policy option 12 instead raises the healthcare allowance for the elderly by \u20ac 0.3 bn. This allowance is an income and assets tested contribution towards the cost of health insurance. For incomes up to \u20ac 21,000, the 2020 monthly amounts were \u20ac 104 and \u20ac 199 for households with and without a benefit partner, respectively. For higher incomes, the amounts are gradually reduced until they become zero at an income of around \u20ac 30,000 or \u20ac 39,000, respectively. Policy option 12 raises these amounts proportionally until a total budgetary impact of \u20ac 0.3 bn is reached. However, the healthcare allowance for the lowest incomes amounts to the cheapest health insurance policy. Since people\u2019s benefit cannot exceed the cost of their insurance, any effect of this policy option is therefore likely to be limited.

In addition, for elderly people with incomes below \u20ac 35,000, a multiplying factor of 113% applies. This means that they can deduct more than they actually spent. Policy option 13 raises this multiplying factor up to the point where the expected budgetary impact reaches \u20ac 0.3 bn. This further supports elderly people with low incomes and considerable out-of-pocket health spending. <a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a> shows modest effects on poverty, which is to be expected given the already low poverty among people of retirement age.",

For higher incomes, it was linearly reduced at a rate of around 5.7% until it reached zero for incomes above \u20ac 68,508. Most households are in principle eligible for this tax credit. However, people with low incomes may not be able to fully use it because their income tax is too low. The policy option makes the general tax credit refundable so that everyone can fully use it. The option costs \u20ac 4.8 bn and reduces poverty by 16.0% (people) and 19.1% (euros), respectively. It also lowers employment by 0.8% and reduces income inequality by 1.1%.

The latter is done in such a way that the upper and lower income thresholds of the phase out trajectory remain the same and the linear rate at which the tax credit declines for higher levels of income is raised (hence the phase out path becomes steeper). This means that the effective marginal tax rate in income increases, which weakens the incentives of people to work. Policy option 15 costs \u20ac 5.4 bn and reduces the incidence and intensity of poverty by 17.5% and 20.1%, respectively. It lowers employment by 0.8% and reduces income inequality by 1.3%. The last option in <a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a>, policy option 16, raises the tax deductibility of healthcare costs. This is identical to option 13 except that it applies not only to the elderly but to the whole population. As before, it costs \u20ac 0.3 bn.

There is therefore no a priori reason why their effects on poverty should be of a similar magnitude. But even when accounting for differences in costs, the effects on poverty are hardly comparable. While raising the child budget or the minimum income benefit offers the most bang for the buck, policy options aimed at the working poor, the elderly or the general population are less efficient in combating poverty. To some extent this is to be expected given the relatively high incidence of poverty among children and minimum income benefit recipients. But even the most cost efficient policies provide far from a free lunch. Lowering poverty by 20 percent through raising minimum income benefit to the level of the state pension, for example, costs almost 3 billion euros. This is around half the total budget of the minimum income scheme in the Netherlands. In addition to the budgetary costs, raising minimum income support \u2013 through lowering labour market incentives \u2013 also costs jobs. The general picture that emerges from these results is that reducing poverty is possible but comes at the expense of public money and/or jobs. It illustrates the \u2018social trilemma\u2019 faced by policymakers in modern welfare states (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cantillon and Vandenbroucke, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cantillon et al., 2019</a>). Due to slow wage growth at the bottom of the earnings distribution, it becomes increasingly difficult to simultaneously provide adequate minimum income support, maintain sufficient financial incentives for people to find a job, \u00e1nd keep the government budget in check.",

If policymakers would have a billion euros to spent, which policies are expected to yield the biggest reductions in poverty? As before, we order the policies according to age groups. Starting with <i>children</i>, policy option 1 lifts the (means tested) child budget amounts from the third child onwards to the amount that parents receive for their second child. In addition, all amounts are proportionally raised further. Policy option 2 instead proportionally increases the child allowance, which is a universal government contribution to the costs of children. Moving on to the <i>working age population</i>, policy option 3 raises the in-work tax credit for all eligible workers, while policy option 4 increases the benefit amounts for all recipients of minimum income benefit. Policy options 5 and 6 instead lift the incomes of the <i>elderly population</i>. The first does so by making their tax credit refundable and proportionally raising the amounts for all those that are eligible. The second instead raises the healthcare allowance specifically for the elderly. Finally, the last three policies in <a href=\"#table5\">Table 5</a> are of a more general nature.

Raising the <i>minimum income benefit</i> is exclusively aimed at the lowest incomes and therefore has the largest impact. It lifts almost one fifth of the poor population out of poverty and lowers their joint income shortfall by around 8%. Among minimum income benefit recipients, it eliminates poverty by more than half, both in persons and in euros. These reductions in poverty not only have an adverse effect on the government budget of initially \u20ac 1.0 bn but also make paid work less attractive. This lowers employment by 0.7%. It also means fewer people in a paid job and more people on minimum income support, leading to an estimated doubling of the budgetary effect. Hence, raising minimum income support is effective in combating poverty but costs fairly much in terms of money and jobs. A somewhat smaller impact on poverty is achieved when instead investing the taxpayer\u2019s money in raising the <i>rent allowance</i>. This also targets the lowest incomes \u2013 although not as much as minimum income support \u2013 and therefore has a considerable impact as well. It leads to around 11% fewer poor people and an 8% reduction in the intensity of poverty. An advantage of this option is that it costs fewer jobs than raising minimum income support. The other options in <a href=\"#table5\">Table 5</a> yield smaller reductions in poverty, which is at least partly because they are less targeted (<a href=\"#bib36\">Koot and Gielen, 2021</a>). Raising the <i>child budget</i> from the third child onwards and further increasing it for each child lowers the incidence and intensity of poverty by 7.3% and 3.3%, respectively. Among children alone, it eliminates around one fifth of the poverty in persons and around one tenth of the poverty in euros. It also has a small downward effect on total employment. The child budget is in principle less targeted at low incomes than the next most effective policy, which is the <i>healthcare allowance</i>. Still, it offers a poverty reduction that is of at least similar magnitude. A likely explanation is that its focus on children, particularly those in large families, compensates for its lower degree of targeting because poverty is especially prevalent among this group. This also explains why raising the <i>child allowance</i> \u2013 which is not means tested at all and is therefore relatively inefficient \u2013 still generates non-negligible effects on poverty. The remaining four policy options have (mostly) smaller effects, which is to be expected. The <i>general tax credit</i> and the <i>in-work tax credit</i> have relatively long phase out trajectories and are therefore rather crude instruments for reducing poverty. The two options aimed at the elderly are also not very effective, most likely because poverty among this age group is rare to begin with.",

A UBI has long been touted as a solution to poverty (see e.g. Gentilini et al. 2020 for a literature review). Naturally, the effects depend on the amount that is transferred and on how the UBI is financed. In both of the scenarios we simulate, the UBI is combined with a simplification of the tax and benefit system but the degree of simplification and the amount of transferred UBI are different (see <a href=\"#table6\">Table 6</a>).",

The UBI is therefore higher than the amount of minimum income benefit in our baseline scenario. Note that both of our UBI scenarios assign an income to individuals as well as households. In scenario 1 each individual receives 560 euros per month, and each household 500 euros per month. This implies that the total UBI of a couple is not twice but approximately 1.5 times the amount of UBI of a single person household. The rationale behind this choice is related to the current design of the Dutch tax and benefit system, which is characterised by a mixture of individual and household-level measures. We analyse how a basic income can simplify the current system by replacing these measures with individual and household UBI components.",

Simplifying the allowance system in this way may lower poverty by reducing non-take-up. However, it can also come at the expense of targeting specific groups, which may actually result in higher poverty. Following <a href=\"#bib36\">Koot and Gielen (2021)</a> , we replace the rent allowance, healthcare allowance and child budget by one unified allowance. We determine the amount of this allowance by implementing a two-step procedure. In the first step, we estimate the parameters that should be used to determine the amount of allowance if it were to minimise the impact on household income. In the second step, we adjust these parameters in such a way that budget neutrality is guaranteed. This results in the following equation for the amount of the unified allowance (<a href=\"#bib36\">Koot and Gielen, 2021</a>):",

The first is a negative <i>income</i> effect, which originates from the extra income support that the UBI provides and the disincentive to work that comes with it. The second is a negative <i>substitution</i> effect, which occurs because the higher tax rates needed to finance the UBI also make work less attractive. The income and substitution effects imply that workers work fewer hours (the intensive margin) and people who are not employed are less likely to find paid employment (the extensive margin). In our analysis, these adverse effects on employment manifest themselves mostly among second earners in couples with children. The employment of singles and single parents is least affected.",

Consequently, this scenario results in an even larger poverty reduction, but also in an even lower structural employment, as the income and substitution effects are amplified (see <a href=\"#table7\">Table 7</a>). The abolition of the child care allowance and child budget has an additional disincentivising effect on single parents and second earners in couples with children. This scenario also has large redistributive consequences. Income inequality falls by 11.7%. Moreover, the median effect on household disposable income is most favourable for the lowest quintile of the income distribution and gradually decreases for higher quintiles (see <a href=\"#table9\">Table 9</a>). Nevertheless, not all low income households are doing better under this scenario. For many of the ones with children, for example, the increases in the UBI and (universal) child allowance do not fully cover the loss of the child care allowance and child budget. By contrast, the incomes of richer households, who receive less or no child budget and less child care allowance, may actually increase because of the higher (universal) child allowance. These opposite effects are illustrated by the results in <a href=\"#table9\">Table 9</a>, which document a wide variety in the predicted income change for families with children.",

When looking at different types of households specifically, they all document negative median income effects, except for single-earner couples. As before, the latter clearly benefit the most from these reforms. The decline in structural employment is only 0.9%. This scenario hence shows that it is possible to substantially reduce poverty without a large system overhaul and large universal transfers.

The results show that it would increase employment by 0.6% and lower the Gini-coefficient by 0.7% (see <a href=\"#table7\">Table 7</a>). At the same time, it would also lead to substantially more poverty. This seemingly contradictory result can be explained as follows. Due to the chosen parameters for the amount of the unified allowance, households with incomes around the minimum wage gain from the reform, while households with a slightly lower income lose out. The latter tend to be households on benefits, as <a href=\"#table11\">Table 11</a> shows. While the introduction of the unified allowance would have only a small negative median effect on income, it would have more substantial effects on the lower incomes. This would incentivise these households to increase employment, which would then result in an increase in structural employment. Naturally, the increase in poverty could be prevented by raising the allowance but this would come at the expense of lower employment. This scenario clearly points at a long-run trade-off between poverty reduction and employment. It also shows that policymakers face the difficult choice between simplifying policies on the one hand and making sure they target the right households on the other. Nevertheless, as <a href=\"#table11\">Table 11</a> shows, the unified allowance for most households does a reasonable job in limiting the effects on income. This demonstrates that simplifying the allowance system and thereby reducing non-take-up is a real possibility for policymakers.",

Which tax and benefit policy options does it have and what are the costs and benefits of these options? In this paper we have tried to answer these questions by simulating the effects of a range of individual policy measures and four budget-neutral reforms of the income support system. Our results indicate that reducing poverty is possible but involves considerable costs in terms of public money and/or jobs. This political trade-off runs like a red thread through our results and is most starkly illustrated by the simulated effects of introducing a universal basic income at the level of the (relatively generous) state pension. This is expected to structurally reduce the number of poor people by 60% but, under the budget neutrality constraint, would require the lower and higher income tax rates to be raised to the (almost unprecedented) levels of 56.5% and 75.4%, respectively. Unsurprisingly, these changes would have a big impact on employment, with an estimated 8.3% of jobs disappearing. Even policymakers that are firmly committed to reducing poverty would probably be hesitant to pay such a high price. Other policy options are cheaper but also generate smaller reductions in poverty.",

Spending a billion euros on a more generous minimum income scheme exclusively helps the lowest incomes and therefore achieves a larger poverty reduction than a similar investment in other existing tax and benefit policies. At the same time, it costs a lot of jobs and extra money to accommodate the new inflow of benefit recipients. An alternative and cheaper option \u2013 with a somewhat smaller impact on poverty \u2013 is raising the rent allowance. Increasing the child budget is also relatively cost efficient, presumably because of the high incidence of poverty among Dutch children. Policy options aimed at the working poor, the elderly or the general population are less efficient in reducing poverty.",

As also emphasised by these authors, one should keep in mind that our results do not reflect the administrative burden of implementing the various policy options. While some of the targeted measures may be more cost efficient in theory, they can add considerably to the complexity and bureaucracy of the social security system. A possible consequence is that claiming benefits remains feasible only for people with a considerable ability to think and act.",
