                "text": "A concern about a more extensive use of the Value Added Tax (VAT) in national tax systems often arises both from its impact on aggregate consumption and its alleged regressivity over income. Yet, the empirical evidence on this latter issue is still narrow mainly due to the lack of joint data on income and expenditures with enough detail to account for commodity-specific tax rates. After discussing relevant problems in the measurement of VAT incidence over current income \u2013 which are likely to cause severe upward bias in the estimated regressivity \u2013 the paper aixsms at analysing the distributional implications of different VAT structures. In a framework of marginal tax reforms, relying on the concept of Gini elasticity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Yitzhaki, 1983</a>), a general methodology is proposed to analyse and improve the distributional profile of VAT over income. Using a static microsimulation model (EGaLiTe), the methodology is applied on a comprehensive dataset of expenditures and incomes obtained by a statistical matching of two different sources representative of the Italian population. It is shown that an alternative allocation of goods among existing rates could mitigate the regressive profile of the tax over income, and that a properly designed two-rate setting could even improve the distributional outcome compared with the current setting. Finally, behavioural responses to tax-driven price changes are also simulated in order to assess the potential impact of the proposed reforms on aggregate expenditures.",

This finding is confirmed by the various patterns of tax incidence that past research has found when using an income-based or an expenditure-based approach (<a href=\"#bib29\">O\u2019Donoghue <i>et al</i>., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ruiz &amp; Trannoy, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Crossley <i>et al</i>., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Carrera <i>et al</i>., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Decoster <i>et al</i>., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adam <i>et al</i>., 2011</a>).",

Looking at the upper dashed curve, a steep regressive incidence profile appears, especially when moving from the first to the second decile. It is evident that most of the regressivity depends on the incidence in the first and in the last deciles, while a milder decline is recorded within the 2<sup><i>nd</i></sup> and the 9<sup><i>th</i></sup>. A necessary warning about these estimates is that they can be affected by under-reporting of incomes which could be positively related to income itself also in relative terms.<sup><a href=\"#fn13\">13</a></sup> However, as discussed above, this occurrence determines a lower (downward) distortion in the measured regressivity compared to that (upward) introduced by expenditures temporarily higher than income. Inspecting rough data actually reveals there are households whose values of expenditures (17% of the population) or even amounts of VAT (0.14%) are greater than current income, and some other cases where the reported income is zero (0.1%). In particular, such cases are more frequent in the bottom deciles of the income distribution. In a static perspective, these cases can either derive from genuine economic factors such as risk sharing mechanisms that allow consumption smoothing or be an indicator of measurement errors affecting more seriously incomes compared to expenditure variables (see, for example, <a href=\"#bib14\">Decoster <i>et al</i>. 2010</a> and <a href=\"#bib2\">Arsi\u0107 &amp; Altiparmakov 2013</a>). Whatever the reason, this occurrence leads to implausible values of VAT-to-income ratios that, as shown in <a href=\"#s3-1\">Section 3.1</a>, determine a severe upward bias in the measured regressivity. Thus such evidence cannot be assumed as a policy guide for reforms.

This conclusion potentially reduces the appeal of any revision of the multiple tax rate structure, leading to a more radical claim for a uniform VAT rate, and supporting the idea that distributional concerns can be better dealt with elsewhere, such as by personal income taxes or social expenditures. Furthermore, since it is thought that VAT is not associated with the individual ability to pay, its effectiveness on the distributional ground has often been challenged with the argument that it is an indirect device of redistribution (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boeters <i>et al</i>., 2010</a>), a position also held by international institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Commission (EC).

Furthermore, if the targeting were correct, there would be no possibility to reallocate the goods among the three tax rates to obtain a better distributional outcome. <a href=\"#figA2\">Figure A2</a> shows the scattered points of the values of <i>K</i> for the 276 commodities against the VAT rates (including exempt goods that are reported as if they were taxed at zero rate and goods with weighted average tax rates).

This occurs both with equivalent expenditures (panel A) and equivalent disposable income (panel B) used as the ordering variable in the calculation of <i>K</i> in <a href=\"#eqn7\">equation 7</a>. A way to visually inspect the goodness of targeting of tax rates is to include a kernel interpolation. In the case of correct targeting, this interpolation should have a monotonic non-decreasing path (higher tax rates associated to higher values of <i>K</i>). As can be seen, instead, the kernel fit \u2013 while slightly increasing when moving to higher tax rates \u2013 is not monotonic, which means that some goods could be potentially reallocated across the three tax rates improving the distributional outcome. This implies that some room is left, in Italy, to reform the structure of VAT, and the following analysis will be focused on this issue. To this regard, it is worth noting that some exempt goods could be taxed without adverse distributional impacts. However, the choice has been to delimit the analysis to the already taxed commodities, for the main reason that exempt goods are subject to specific European regulation that \u2013 among other things \u2013 also involves the logic of merit goods.<sup><a href=\"#fn21\">21</a></sup>",

Finally, goods that are initially taxed at 21% have moved to 10%, but this occurs only in one case (telephone bills and mobile phone cards).

This implies that the redistributive impact of the two-rate VAT, in principle, might worsen because some goods that should be taxed at 4% are taxed at 7%, but at the same time improve because some goods that should be taxed at 10% are instead taxed at 7%. The net effect is of uncertain sign, but it is possible to show that a significant contribution to the improvement of the distributional outcome comes from those goods that initially taxed at 10% have moved to the new equilibrium standard rate, as well as from the good (telephone bills) that initially taxed at 21% has moved to 7% in the two-rate VAT. Indeed, when a two-rate VAT is designed starting from the <i>status quo</i> (i.e., by taxing at 7% all goods initially taxed at the reduced rates), the distributional outcome would be similar to that of the <i>status quo</i> itself and worse than that obtained with a two-rate VAT based on the intermediate step.<sup><a href=\"#fn27\">27</a></sup>",

For example, only electricity has moved from 10% to 4% in the intermediate step, while a certain number of commodities have moved from 10% to 21%. However, given its high budget share, a significant contribution to the positive distributional impact of R2 comes from the reduction of the tax rate on fuel from 21% to 10% in the intermediate step and then to 7% in the two-rate structure. What happens on fuel points out that the implementation of these reforms does not take into account the possible nature of merit or demerit goods of some commodities. The assumption here is that the correct \u201csocial price\u201d is achieved through excise taxes, which have the aim of realigning the market price to the cost of the externality produced (see, for example, <a href=\"#bib8\">Cnossen &amp; Smart 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Decoster <i>et al</i>. 2010</a>).

On the other hand, where the greatest reduction in taxation occurs (transports and communications with \u22122.50% and \u22122.22% VAT variation in R1 and R2, respectively) both reform scenarios would generate a large increase in pre-tax expenditures (0.73% and 1.96%).

Yet, evidence on the entity of regressivity over income is still limited due to unavailability of joint data sources on income and item-specific consumption. The paper aims at filling this gap by analyzing the joint distribution of very detailed commodity expenditures and incomes on an innovative dataset, which allows assessing the impact of VAT reforms in terms of incidence over income and redistribution. First, the paper discusses a potential source of serious upward bias in the measure of VAT regressivity on cross-sectional income data related to the presence of consumption smoothers in the sample. Indeed, temporary fluctuations of income below consumption in a single-period give rise to a quasi-hyperbolic incidence tending to infinity in the bottom tail of the income distribution. For the Italian case, it appears that the regressive profile of VAT in terms of disposable income is almost entirely driven by the very bottom and the top quantiles, with the incidence profile appearing just mildly decreasing in the central part of the distribution.",

An application of this methodology on Italian data reveals that, regardless of the fact that households are ranked by income or expenditures, an improvement in the distributional outcome does not necessarily require a further differentiation of tax rates. Rather, a proper reallocation of commodities among the existing three rates and even a two-rate VAT could improve upon the current arrangement. Quite interestingly, it is demonstrated that the results hold for different combinations of reduced and standard tax rates, leaving the policy-maker with some degrees of freedom in choosing the proper mix between the two. Finally, by using external price elasticities of demand for groups of expenditures, a robustness check is carried out to assess whether consumer reactions to changes in prices are sufficiently small in terms of the expected impact on aggregate consumption (and tax revenues) to be consistent with a first-order approximation. While these results have an immediate relevance for the Italian case, the methodology proposed is general enough and usefully applicable to countries, in particular the EU ones, where adverse distributional impact of VAT is a source of concern for national tax systems.",
