The paper adds to the growing literature on the interaction between health and work, to which the authors have greatly contributed over the recent years. The second health microsimulation paper, by Abbygail Jaccard and co-authors, focuses on the very crucial topic of uncertainty estimation, where uncertainty is measured by means of global sensitivity analysis (that is, by analysing the effects of each parameter in isolation and their interaction). They apply this method to the UK Health Forum microsimulation model, focusing on BMI and related diseases.",
