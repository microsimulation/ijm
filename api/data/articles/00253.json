There are results which show that both men and women, but in particular women, adjust their hours of work when they get another child. Women decrease their hours. The size of the adjustment depends for instance, on the education and labor market attachment of the woman and on the eligibility to and replacement rate of maternity and family allowances. For men there are conflicting results. In Sweden there are indications that also men, at least some men, also decrease their hours, but there are also results, in particular for other countries which suggest that married men with children work very long hours.",

I would rather like to concentrate on those incentives which lie in the core of most microsimulation models, on those incentives which a microsimulation model has a relative advantage in computing, i.e. the incentives from taxes and benefits. The advantage of a microsimulation model compared to alternative approaches is its capacity to compute with great detail the taxes and benefits which fall upon a household. Many other economic models only use stylized tax and benefit systems which might distort the analyses, but in microsimulation models one can include all the details and use the policy parameters actually used by the politicians. An average marginal tax rate is not a policy instrument but the definition of the tax base is (incl. deductions, thresholds etc.), and the location of the kink points which define tax brackets and the tax rates as such are policy instruments. In evaluating the incentive effects all these details should be used and a microsimulation model is a good instrument for doing it.",

For instance, in many models the marginal tax rate or the composite marginal effect of taxes and benefits is the key measure of work incentives, and a static tax-benefit model can be used to compute marginal effects for various groups of individuals. If they are large, one might also expect large behavioral adjustments. We have been used to see diagrams of marginal effects as a function of income, but the marginal effect is just the slope of the budget set, and it might be useful to visualize the whole budget set. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a> illustrates how this could be done. These diagrams are borrowed from <a href=\"#bib4\">Klevmarken et al. (1995)</a>. The two top diagrams in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> gives the budget sets with the 1985 and 1992 tax systems for a couple. In the left diagram the budget set is a function of the husbands work hours and in the right diagram a function of the spouse\u2019s work hours. In the first diagram the spouse\u2019s hours are kept at their observed number and in the second diagram the husband\u2019s hours are at their observed number. The vertical line marks the observed hours for the husband and wife respectively. The diagrams show that the introduction of the new tax system increased after tax income, and if the husband would increase his hours, he would have gained more from the new system than the old, while the spouse\u2019s gain if she would increase her work hours is not much greater with the new system compared to the old.

At this number of hours there is not much change in median income as a result of the tax change, but the marginal return of a change in work hours is a little higher (in the median) in the new tax system.

In addition to variables like age, schooling and labor market experience, there are three income variables attempting to capture incentive effects. They are the income an individual would obtain after tax if he/she did not work at all, if he/she worked half-time or full-time. These variables interact with age dummies and a pension dummy to make it feasible to differentiate the incentive effects by age and by pension status. The larger the potential income from full-time work is, the higher probability to take up work, in particular for males older than 30 years. The estimates for females were insignificant.",

The idea behind the Hausman model is illustrated in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. Along the horizontal axes we mark hours of leisure and along the vertical axis income after tax. The convex piece wise linear curve shows the budget set of an individual with a progressive tax system. The slope of the curve becomes smaller the more the individual works, and the higher his income and marginal tax rate becomes. (A move towards the income axis.) An indifference curve has a point of tangency to the budget set at h* hours, which is the optimal \"desired\" number of hours for this individual. We do not observe h* but h because it might not have been possible to find a job at h* or there might be measurement errors in our measure of hours of work. The deviation h*-h is usually assumed to be random and normally distributed. The estimates of the wage rate and income elasticities used in MICROHUS are reproduced in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>. All income elasticities are negative. As income increases singles decrease their work hours more than married and cohabiting couples. In the latter group males react marginally stronger than females. All compensated wage rate elasticities are positive and the elasticity for singles is much higher than those for married and cohabiting males and females.",

By allowing the parameters of the offer distribution to depend on factors which are related to vacancies or unemployment it is possible to introduce a heterogeneity in the risk of becoming unemployed. There is, however, a remaining problem with timing. The budget set of a Hausman model is usually an annual budget set because taxes are computed on an annual basis, but a person might become unemployed at any time in a year. A mechanism is thus needed which dates the transition from employment to unemployment. (One reason for this is that unemployment compensation is given on a daily basis.) One possibility is to draw a date randomly, another to allow job offers to arrive sequentially every day or every week and scale down the probability of exits to unemployment to daily or weekly probabilities. It is, however, not obvious how such a mechanism could be made consistent with utility maximization subject to an annual budget constraint.",

This probability could be made a function of the vacancy or unemployment rate and of personal characteristics, and thus vary both across individuals and over time. In this way most individuals will keep their old jobs and work hours, but some will become unemployed unless they get another job offer and accept it, and some will accept new job offers although they already have a job. To estimate such a model one will need annual panel data with at least two observations on each individual. The possibility to identify and estimate both preference parameters and offer distributions will depend on what 6 specific assumptions are made and what kind of data are available.",

Jobs are not only characterized by their hours of work but also by a wage rate, fringe benefits and other work conditions. More generally, the compensation for a job could be given in the form of a flat hourly wage rate, a monthly salary or some kind of incentive scheme. With a job could also follow the opportunity to do over time, or the obligation to do it, and certain rules for the corresponding compensation, all of which might be of importance to explain incentive effects of taxes. A job is thus a package of all these things, and if we had data of sufficient detail they could be included in the model. But to simplify and disregard everything else but work hours and wage rates, the distribution would then become a bivariate distribution. By drawing from this distribution, a combination of work hours and a wage rate would then be offered to each person. Wage offers would depend on, for instance schooling, experience, seniority, industry and occupation.",

For some purposes this is rather unrealistic. For instance, people\u2019s educational and occupational choices are usually thought of as determined by the relation between the discounted stream of expected future earnings and the costs of studying, taking student grants into account. Also, the demand for housing should be seen as the result of an intertemporal utility maximization. In both cases expectations about future taxes, and in the housing case future housing allowances and interest subsidies could influence decisions. For instance, in modeling educational choices one would need life cycle earnings after tax and net of student grants and loans. The conditions of student loans in terms of interest rate and repayments would thus need to be extended into the future.",

Similarly, a change in the tax and benefit system which increases the cost of housing, like in the 1991 Swedish tax reform, should be capitalized in smaller market values of owner-occupied houses and co-operatives.",
