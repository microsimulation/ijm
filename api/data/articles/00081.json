In the second paper of this issue, Tony Lawson uses random assignment schemes as an alternative approach to model household expenditures. The central idea is that the behavioural response of a household in its expenditures following a change in income can be reflected by a \u2018donor\u2019 household. The latter is selected to be similar to the receiving household, while being different only in its income. Lawson uses the OpenABM model to illustrate the approach by comparing specific groups (single pensioners, families) to the average, and by considering the impact of positive and negative income changes.",

They discuss the implementation of the savings and asset allocation decision of households in the Italian model CAPP_DYN. Their approach takes into account the role of lifetime economic resources in households\u2019 consumption decisions, as well as internal habit formation and subjective expectations on pension outcomes in the econometric stage. Finally, intergenerational transfers of private wealth are also included.",
