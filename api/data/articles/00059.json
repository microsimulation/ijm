                "text": "Health&WealthMOD is the first Australian microsimulation model designed to determine the economic impacts of disease on older workers, aged 45 to 65 years. Chronic health conditions are known to be associated with early retirement. This paper describes an application of Health&WealthMOD to estimate the impact of this association on projected labour force participation to 2020 given the ageing population and long-term trend in chronic conditions. Due to ageing and disease trends, the number of people with chronic conditions in the 45\u201364 years age group was expected to rise to about 4.8 million by 2020, an increase of 82% from the 2003 population of the same age group. About 904,000 persons in the 45\u201364 age group were projected to be out of the labour force due to ill health in 2020, when only the ageing and population growth were considered. When trends in illness were captured, the figure was increased to about 1.2 million persons. This demonstrates that health is a major driver of labour force participation and retirement and that economic policies alone, with no consideration of health interventions to treat or prevent chronic illness, will only have a limited impact on labour force participation. Thus, it is important that the government focuses on both health policies and economic policies in order to make sure that there will be an adequate supply of labour force in future.",

Indeed, the previous government responded by providing a number of economic incentives to encourage older workers to remain in the labour force until at least the age of 60 years. For example, the government removed the 15 per cent tax on superannuation schemes if retirement is delayed until the age of 60 years (<a href=\"#bib8\">Australian Government, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1998</a>), and changed the superannuation rules to allow workers to continue to work while drawing on a superannuation pension from 1 July 2005 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Australian Government, 2004</a>).",

As ill health is a major constraint on older workers\u2019 labour force participation, these economic incentives may not increase the future supply of older labour as substantially as it otherwise could have. Accordingly, measures to reduce ill health amongst older workers may be just as important in preventing labour shortages as economic measures.",

Similarly, there has been a fall in the prevalence of some health risk factors (such as smoking) and a rise in others (such as obesity). There has been mixed evidence about trends in disability. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) reported rising age adjusted national rates of disability between 1981 and 1998 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2001</a>). However, the AIHW later concluded that rising age adjusted rates of disability observed over this period were due to changes in the Australian Bureau of Statistics Disability, Ageing and Carers Surveys. Nonetheless, it was concluded that there had not been a fall in age adjusted rates of disability (<a href=\"#bib10\">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2003</a>).

Assuming linear growth in the age sex standardised prevalence rates, trends in each chronic condition were calculated to determine whether there was a significant increase or decrease over the 10 year period from the 1993 survey to the survey conducted in 2003, with the exception of dorsopathies (back conditions) which was calculated over the period 1998 to 2003 as changes in definitions meant that the series was not continuous. The growth rate over the 10 year period for different conditions varied between an annual growth rate of 12.3% for diseases of the nervous system and \u22123.4% for diseases of the eye and adnexa.

In this study, we have assumed that without the chronic condition, persons might have achieved the labour force participation of their 5-year age and sex cohort.

While ageing was expected to produce a net increase of around 250,500 non labour force participants, trends in chronic illness were anticipated to have a considerably greater effect.

Lifestyle factors such as smoking, or being sedentary or overweight in midlife have been shown to be predictors of subsequent disability (<a href=\"#bib35\">Vita <i>et al.</i>, 1998</a>). While smoking rates in Australia have declined considerably, increases in obesity and reductions in physical activity have been well documented (<a href=\"#bib11\">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2006</a>), and obesity is widely recognised as a major risk factor for multiple chronic diseases and subsequent disability (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sturm <i>et al.</i>, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gill, 2002</a>). Given the strong evidence to support the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions and medications in prevention of chronic disease and subsequent disability (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gillies <i>et al.</i>, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Baigent <i>et al.</i>, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">British Cardiac Society <i>et al.</i>, 2005</a>), the findings from Health&amp;WealthMOD provide further evidence to support large-scale investment in these interventions to avert the projected increase in chronic disease with its considerable impact on the future workforce.

However, apparent inconsistencies between the current findings and those of previous studies are the result of methodological differences. While our data suggests that more women are out of the labour force due to ill health than men (346,297 and 308,126 respectively), the Retirement and Retirement Intentions survey conducted by the ABS (<a href=\"#bib4\">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1998</a>) found the opposite: 154,300 women had retired due to their own ill health compared to 335,400 men. However, those figures include only people who had retired from full time work and thus women, who are more likely never to have worked full time, are underrepresented. The current study, on the other hand, included all people out of the labour force in 2003 regardless of employment history, resulting in a higher count of women. Proportionally, however, women in this study were less likely to be out of the labour force due to a health condition than their male counterparts (51% and 76% of those out of the labour force respectively). They were also less likely to be out of work due to poor health than for other reasons, both findings consistent with the Retirement and Retirement Intentions survey. address the health conditions associated with low labour force participation. Thus, government Several limitations need to be taken into account while interpreting the results of this study. The chronic illness used in this study is the respondents\u2019 self-reported main condition and co- morbidities are not accounted for. Although self- reported health is regarded as a valid measure (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wannamethee &amp; Shaper, 1991</a>), a possible bias in the results can not be excluded. Similarly, the exclusion of co-morbidities in the study makes the impact estimates of chronic conditions on labour force participation a conservative estimate. Finally, it is assumed in this study that the growth for each group of condition would be linear. It is possible that there will be a flattening out of the trend for each disease at some point. However, there is insufficient data to assess this and while the precise figures may not prove to be exact, the results point to the critical importance of addressing the rising prevalence of chronic conditions as part of labour force policy.",

This is important in itself in a country where policy options have focussed on economic incentive to delay retirement such as changes to superannuation taxation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Australian Government, 2006</a>). This paper demonstrates that these economic policies, however important they are, will only have a limited impact on labour force participation, without health policies which policies need to focus on both health interventions to treat or prevent chronic conditions and providing economic incentives to increase the labour force participation of the older working Australian population to ensure an adequate supply of labour in the future.",
