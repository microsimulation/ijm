Dynamic population microsimulation models, which age an entire population through time for some decades, create particular validation challenges. This article outlines some of the issues that arise when attempting to validate dynamic population models, including changing behaviour, the need to align results with other aggregate \u2018official\u2019 projections, data quality and useability. Drawing on recent experience with the construction of the new Australian Population and Policy Simulation Model (APPSIM), the article discusses the techniques being used to validate this new dynamic population microsimulation model.",

The modern welfare state today typically consists of a plethora of overlapping tax and outlay programs designed to meet multiple social policy objectives -including income redistribution and ensuring that most citizens enjoy an adequate standard of living and have reasonable access to such social services as health and education. These objectives are met through a very wide range of policy instruments, including both means-tested and universal cash transfers or service provision; means-tested and/or categorical eligibility for various tax concessions; and publicly-mandated insurance schemes or payments to be made by employers, employees or individuals. In an environment of such complexity, it is not surprising that policy makers attempt to reduce some of the risk associated with unintended or unexpected outcomes from policy change by using microsimulation models.",

However, in recent years many of the key policy challenges faced by the welfare state have required a much longer term perspective than that typically embodied in static microsimulation models (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cotis, 2003</a>). In particular, the phenomenon of structural population ageing where, in decades to come, a relatively smaller proportion of taxpayers will have to support a relatively larger proportion of retirees, has created a desire among policy makers to look at policy consequences five or more decades into the future. In essence, in many countries there are grave doubts about the extent to which generous cash transfer programmes for retirees or highly subsidised health and aged care services will continue to be affordable (for recent examples from across the world see <a href=\"#bib24\">Harding and Gupta, 2007a</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gupta and Harding 2007</a>; and <a href=\"#bib51\">Zaidi et al, 2009</a>).",

Dynamic microsimulation models were the brainchild of Guy Orcutt who, frustrated by the macroeconomic models of the day, proposed a new type of model consisting of interacting, decision-making entities such as individuals, families and firms (<a href=\"#bib43\">1957</a>, 2007). Dynamic models move individuals forward through time, by updating each attribute for every individual for each time interval. Thus, the individuals within the original microdata or base file are progressively moved forward through time by making major life events \u2013 such as death, marriage, divorce, fertility, education, labour force participation etc. \u2013 happen to each individual, in accordance with the probabilities of such events happening to real people within a particular country. Thus, within a dynamic microsimulation model, the characteristics of each individual are recalculated for each time period.",

Such dynamic microsimulation models have played a central role in government policy formation in many countries, including DYNACAN (used for Canada Pension Plan projections (<a href=\"#bib38\">Morrison, 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2009</a>)); DYNASIM, CBOLT and MINT in the US (used to inform the decisions of Congress and policy players about future welfare and tax policies (<a href=\"#bib6\">Butrica &amp; Iams, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Favreault and Sammartino, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sabelhaus and Topoleski, 2006</a>)), MOSART in Norway (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fredriksen &amp; Stolen, 2007</a>), SESIM in Sweden (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sundberg, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Klevmarken &amp; Lindgren, 2008</a>); Destinie within France (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blanchet &amp; Le Minez, 2009</a>); PENSIM within the UK Department of Work and Pensions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Emmerson et al., 2004</a>); and MIDAS in Belgium (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dekkers, 2010</a>). Such models are being used to shed light on the likely future costs of welfare state programs and the distributional impact of possible changes. For example, in Sweden, projections suggested that their retirement pension scheme would be unaffordable in the future and the government successfully legislated to reduce future benefits and increase the age at which retirement pensions became payable (<a href=\"#bib16\">Flood, 2007</a>). Australia itself began a five year project in late 2005 to construct a dynamic population microsimulation model, the Australian Population and Policy Simulation Model (APPSIM) (covered in more detail below).",

To give one example, international conferences of the microsimulation community in 1993, 1997, 1998, 2003 and 2007 have resulted in six edited volumes, which together provide a very good overview of the state of microsimulation and its development over the past two decades or so (<a href=\"#bib22\">Harding, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gupta &amp; Kapur, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mitton et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">Harding &amp; Gupta 2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gupta &amp; Harding, 2007</a> and <a href=\"#bib52\">Zaidi et al, 2009</a>). Yet, almost all of the dozens of chapters in these books focus upon the results of policy simulations, with only a handful dealing with validation issues (most notably the excellent chapter by <a href=\"#bib7\">Caldwell and Morrison, 2000</a>). As Wolfson noted, the US National Academy of Science, in a specially commissioned panel study on microsimulation for public policy purposes in 1991, highlighted two major problems with microsimulation \u2013 validation of model results and provision of adequate data (2000, p. 155). Almost a decade after this review, Wolfson observed that the National Academy panel\u2019s recommendations on validation seemed \u2018generally not to have been followed\u2019 in the US and elsewhere (2000, p. 162).",

This article thus aims to share key aspects of NATSEM\u2019s experience on the validation of dynamic population microsimulation models.

Finally, the linking of the records of an individual through time allows lifecycle analysis. For example, one of the functions of the welfare state is to smooth income flows across the lifecycle of individuals, providing extra support through transfers and public services during the early lifecycle years of study and in retirement while levying higher taxes during the peak working years (<a href=\"#bib21\">Harding, 1993</a>).

The model must create cross-sectional output for future years that appears credible. Often, the users will require the summed results for the individuals within the model to match external benchmarks that are considered reliable, such as official population projections. Similarly, for example, results from the Canadian DYNACAN model had to be aligned to the cell-based actuarial valuation model ACTUCAN (<a href=\"#bib39\">Morrison, 2008</a>, p. 9). Aligning the micro values produced by dynamic models with known or projected macro aggregates usually involves some modification of model estimates. Whilst this modification does change the aggregate outputs of the model, it generally doesn\u2019t change the distributions, preserving the microeconomic content (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson 2001</a>, p. 2\u20136). On occasion, the aggregated results produced from other models that are trusted by policy makers conflict with one another, or are created on a different basis to the microsimulation model (e.g. by including different populations, such as those in non-private dwellings), making the task of matching the projected aggregates particularly challenging. A further difficulty is that there may be no other available projections of a variable of interest produced by a dynamic microsimulation model, so that no data exist against which to compare the model output.",

If there are too many transitions simulated within the model \u2013 for example, too many divorces or too many periods of unemployment \u2013 then the estimates of future retirement incomes and other crucial variables will be incorrect. This is a particularly problematic area for most dynamic modellers. First, as Zaidi et al. noted when commenting on the need for further validation of the long-term trajectories of employment and earnings produced by the UK SAGE microsimulation model, \u2018unfortunately there was little reliable independent data available with which to compare the simulated results\u2019 (2009, p. 371). Second, as they also noted, period and cohort effects are also important and \u2018we cannot assume that those entering the labour market in the 1990s will follow the same trajectories as the previous generation\u2019 (2009, p. 371). This same caveat applies across many of the areas that dynamic microsimulation models seek to simulate, with the on-going long-term decline in mortality rates providing another pertinent example. Continuing changes in behaviour, in the economy, in government policy and in health status all combine to present challenges to the validation of the output of dynamic models.",

Accurate estimation of the transition probabilities underlying dynamic models requires the availability of panel data, where the same individuals are tracked through time. To help in the estimation of relative rare events (such as the likelihood of having a child), a large sample is highly desirable. To assist in the evaluation of how frequently individuals change their state (such as entering or leaving the labour force or a de facto partnership), panel data that spans a significant number of years is ideally required. While there has undoubtedly been an improvement in the availability of panel data during the past decade, most researchers attempting to construct dynamic models still do not have access to all of the data that they ideally require to build and validate the model.",

Credibility for APPSIM, a dynamic population microsimulation model, is critical for its continued development and acceptance within government. One essential element that is required for APPSIM to be accepted as credible is its ability to track historic data and produce projections that are reasonably consistent with other related official and non-official projections \u2013 and, where no such projections exist, the results must be plausible.

In practice, this feature of APPSIM has shown itself to be of great value, with the researcher who has estimated the transition probabilities or design of a particular module being successfully able to identify errors made within the code written by APPSIM\u2019s key programmer.",

The advantage of APPSIM\u2019s modular structure is that some modules can be simulated independently of others. This allowed the developers to build modules one at a time, and to run APPSIM to check for errors as it was developed. For example, the first prototype versions of APPSIM only simulated disability demographics, household formation and dissolution, education and the labour force.

In contrast, with alignment set to OFF, the outcomes of that module will be purely an outcome of the transition probabilities or equations within that module. This allows model developers to validate the equation-generated outputs of each module in isolation. It is difficult to over-estimate the significance of alignment in a dynamic population microsimulation model that is to be used for projections by government and other agencies. For example, within the five year timeline of the existing APPSIM project, there have already been remarkable changes in both individual behaviour and government policy including, for example, sharp changes in fertility and the immigration intake. Given the time lags involved in the production of panel data and the relative rarity of some events, it is simply not possible to simulate such marked swings in behaviour or policy by re-estimating the equations underlying many of the APPSIM transitions. As a result, in many cases alignment has to be used to produce sensible results or policy change simulations. More detail is provided below on the alignment procedures used within APPSIM.",

The IOT enables each individual in scope for a transition to be output, along with the algorithm coefficients and parameters generated within the simulation at that point in time. This output provides a valuable source dataset for validation. In the case of logistic regression equation algorithms, every simulated coefficient, parameter and outcome is able to be checked and compared with theoretical or externally calculated values. Similarly, in the case of applying a distribution of outcomes based on a probability distribution, the simulated outcomes for individuals and the overall groups can be compared with theoretical outcomes for those in scope.

The IOT can also be used to ensure that the correct individuals are being selected for transition. For instance, while we want a certain proportion of women to have a child in every year, we do not want the same women to be chosen each year. In other words we can use the IOT to observe the lifetime childbirths of a person and ensure these lifetime results are valid as well as the cross-sectional results.",

Users who do not require complex, in-depth analysis of results can simply look at the charts, rather than analyse the \u2018everyone output\u2019 themselves by using a statistical package such as SAS or STATA. Furthermore, summary statistics make validation easer, as modellers can tell quickly whether their aggregate output appears reasonable or not. There is a time cost to the production of this user friendly output, although our initial calculations suggest that this cost is only a few minutes per year of simulation, with a simulation of the full database (of some 200,000 individuals in the start year) for 50 years currently taking more than 12 hours to run<sup><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup>. However, one of the lessons from NATSEM\u2019s earlier experience with the DYNAMOD dynamic microsimulation model and from on-going experience with the STINMOD static microsimulation model is that it is essential that a model be made as accessible to non-programmers as possible. While there will always be a handful of sophisticated users who require access to source code and who have the skills to analyse complicated output datasets, constant turnover of staff within client agencies means that it is essential to do everything possible to facilitate usage and training if a microsimulation model is to stay \u2018alive\u2019.",

This form of validation is essential before moving towards multi-module validation, as one can be reasonably sure that errors in the model output are due to flaws in the module under examination. For example, if a modeller examines unaligned output to validate the labour force module and finds that labour force participation is too low, it could be that the labour force module is mis-specified, or it could be that errors in the education, family formation, births or disability modules are affecting labour force participation, as all these modules provide inputs into labour force participation.

For both sexes APPSIM simulates retirement rates that are lower at young ages; this is largely because in APPSIM one cannot retire until one turns 55 while, in HILDA, some people retire at age 54 or earlier. APPSIM retirement rates can be expected to be slightly lower as APPSIM does not attempt to simulate the effect of some generous early-retirement pensions, which are now being phased out in Australia. Likewise, APPSIM retirement rates are slightly higher among the oldest people shown in this graph, as APPSIM assumes 100 percent retirement by age 75. The long-term cross-sectional validation of the labour force module involved comparing APPSIM outputs to long-term projections \u2013 out to 2047 -made by the ABS and Treasury. These projections were far less detailed than the short-term data available, so long-term validation was performed on the basis of labour force participation by age and sex only.",

For men, overall APPSIM simulations track Treasury\u2019s simulations reasonably closely, with the exception of slightly lower full-time employment among males in their 30s and 40s, due to higher rates of part-time employment and unemployment. However, overall participation patterns are reasonably similar to Treasury projections. The main difference in labour force participation is that Treasury projections show labour force participation starting to decline among men in their fifties, while APPSIM shows men maintaining high rates of labour force participation up until their sixties. This is due to a key assumption made by the APPSIM labour force model which is that, as the age at which one can access superannuation increases to age 60, men will be much more likely to remain in the labour force until they are out of their fifties. It should be noted that Treasury has recently released revised labour force projections as part of its latest Intergenerational Report, which provides a pertinent illustration of how the external benchmark data against which the output of a dynamic microsimulation model is being evaluated can change relatively rapidly (<a href=\"#bib49\">2010</a>).",

For example, consider the two centre charts, those that show APPSIM and HILDA transitions in the 25\u201354 age group. The APPSIM chart (on the left) shows that 88 percent of 25\u201354 year olds who were full-time employed in APPSIM in 2004 were still employed full-time in 2005. Eight percent of these people switched to part-time employment, two percent were unemployed and two percent had left the labour force. The HILDA chart (on the right) shows that 91 percent of people who were full-time employed in 2004 were still working full-time in 2005. Of the remainder, seven percent worked part-time, one percent were unemployed and one percent left the labour force. These charts offer some reassurance about the year to year labour force transitions simulated in APPSIM \u2013 although it should also be recognised that there is considerable \u2018noise\u2019 in the HILDA estimates due to small sample size in some groups and also that the HILDA data were collected during a period of strong economic growth, so an ability to change the APPSIM alignment parameters is essential given such factors as the recent Global Financial Crisis.",

For example, if the Australian Treasury\u2019s long-term modelling shows, hypothetically, that a two percent increase in labour force participation over the long term produces a three percent increase in total superannuation balances after 20 years, APPSIM could be tested by using alignment to simulate a similar increase in participation and comparing its increase in superannuation balances to those simulated by Treasury.",

They attribute this to the fact that the further the probability of an event is from 0.5, the less likely the equations are to produce the desired result. In other words the simulation may under or over predict the number of events (<a href=\"#bib42\">O\u2019Donoghue et al. 2009</a>, p.25). Unfortunately, in the real world, few event probabilities are close to 0.5 (for example, the chance of childbirth in the next 12 months for a woman aged 15 to 49 years is 0.04) and, thus, even perfectly specified models will produce incorrect event outcomes.",

In the earlier \u2018simpler\u2019 versions of alignment, every person in scope for a particular event was assigned a probability score. Then the in-scope population was ranked based on their score. In this \u2018simple\u2019 version of alignment, the appropriate number of people to make the transition were then selected, based their ranking, to match the external benchmark. This strategy effectively ensures that correct number of persons with the right characteristics experience the event. However, in the real world these events are stochastic \u2013 there is an element of randomness in who is selected to transition.

As four per cent of women in this age group have a child, it could be expected that all of the actual births would have come from the highest probability quintile. In reality only 43 per cent of births came from this group and 20 per cent of births occurred to women in the lowest probability quintile.

The method currently implemented in APPSIM provides both variability in those selected for transition and control over the amount of variation. In theory, different levels of variation could be used for different events -and a very high level of variation be used for an event like childbirth but a low level of variation be used for, say employed fathers of young children leaving the labour force. At this stage in APPSIM\u2019s development, the level of inversion used to introduce variation is set at a single value for all events and this level of inversion is user- defined.

Thus, this involves examining whether a reasonable number of marriages, employment transitions, education transitions and so on appear to be simulated over the longer term. Validation and any associated possible longitudinal alignment are particularly difficult in this domain, because of the typical lack of adequate data to benchmark or calibrate against. However, one area where we have experimented with improving our longitudinal outcomes is in the simulation of fertility within APPSIM. This was initially prompted by the substantial number of larger families being generated by the fertility transition equations originally estimated from the HILDA data. The alignment spreadsheet has been refined by adding parity to the fertility alignment benchmarks for each age and marital status group. Every year, once births have been initially allocated, APPSIM\u2019s alignment process examines how many women in each age bracket have had one, two, three, four or more children. If too many women in a particular age bracket have had too many children, alignment will reallocate the births for that year so that the distribution of children among women is appropriate. Examination of the outcomes from the family formation and dissolution modules is continuing, to determine whether any special measures need to be taken to control the number of marriages, divorces, and de facto partnerships and separations.",

As Morrison observed, DYNACAN, for example, was required to align its earning outcomes to target distributions prescribed by the ACTUCAN model (2008, p. 16). MIDAS separates monetary alignment by sex and uses a two-stage uprating process to align earnings. This allows earnings to be aligned while still taking into account the impact of the age and sex distribution within the population on average earnings (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dekkers et al, 2010</a>). Within APPSIM alignment to a range of monetary targets has been implemented. For example, average earnings increase at a constant rate defined by the model user. In the modelling of superannuation (retirement pension) contributions, a range of alignment techniques are used. Macro alignment is used to ensure the aggregate amount contributed matches benchmarks. Meso-alignment is used to match the proportion of people making voluntary contributions by age, sex and labour force status and the proportion of their income that each contributes.",
