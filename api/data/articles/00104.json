The authors use this to assess the economic consequences of premature mortality, which they find to be substantial. The simulation of counterfactuals -what has <i>not</i> happened- is of course an interesting facet of this paper. Also interesting from the point of view of methodology is that the link between the two models is based on a compound metric, called SEIFA, summarizing a range of information on social and economic conditions of individuals and households in a given geographic area.",

Although this clearly is a key factor in households\u2019 financial vulnerability, it does not receive the attention it deserves, mainly because of the problems in data and modelling. Their paper integrates microeconomic household data with macroeconomic data to simulate the evolution of households\u2019 debt in Italy. They find, first of all, that the proportion of vulnerable households in Italy is not expected to change dramatically over the next years. But they also find that a change in income growth has a considerably larger effect than changes in the interest rates.",
