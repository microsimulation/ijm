                "text": "This article presents SWISSMOD, a new microsimulation model of the Swiss Tax and Transfer System (TTS) built on the EUROMOD platform. The significant variations in tax burden and transfer payments due to subnational fiscal autonomy make the Swiss TTS\u2014and thus SWISSMOD\u2014particularly intriguing for economic analyses. We focus on three core aspects of SWISSMOD. First, we provide an overview of EUROMOD-based and Swiss microsimulation models, followed by an introduction to the Swiss TTS, highlighting its fiscal autonomy, wealth taxation, joint taxation types, and the administration of social assistance at the subnational level, leading to substantial variation in transfer payments. Second, we provide insights into the Swiss SILC dataset, which forms the database of our model. Given the dataset\u2019s lack of information on cantonal residence and wealth, we outline our approach to imputing this missing data using the Swiss Household Panel. Third, we present the results of the micro- and macro-validation. The micro-validation indicates that the model accurately represents the existing TTS. The results of the macro-validation confirm a high degree of fiscal precision at the aggregated level of income taxation. However, certain limitations exist concerning wealth taxation, driven by the lack of information on wealth. Overall, the model provides reliable results concerning the Swiss TTS.",

This accuracy is further corroborated by the macro-validation, which demonstrates a high degree of fiscal precision at the aggregated level.

Common wealth indicators are identified and retained in the extended dataset, along with household and original dataset identifiers. A total wealth variable is created by combining all wealth variables present in the SHP dataset, which naturally has missing values for all CH-SILC observations. Similarly, a mortgage variable is created, which is also empty for CH-SILC observations. Subsequently, a weighted predictive mean matching is performed. Each CH-SILC observation is matched to its closest counterpart and assigned the corresponding monetary amount of wealth recorded for that match. The same procedure is applied to the mortgage data from the SHP dataset. After the matching process, SHP observations are removed, and the imputed wealth is assigned to the household head. Mortgages are also aggregated. As a last step, for all individuals under 18, wealth is recoded to zero, as their wealth is already included in household wealth and, by law, assigned to their legal guardian.",

However, a different picture emerges when examining wealth taxation, where SWISSMOD underestimates revenues at both cantonal and municipal levels. This discrepancy can be attributed to data issues. As mentioned in section 4, the imputation of wealth data has led to an underestimation of large fortunes, which make up a sizable part of the overall wealth distribution in Switzerland (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mart\u00ednez, 2022</a>). There may be room for improvement in the imputation of wealth data into the SILC dataset, however, the issue likely also stems from underreporting in the donor dataset (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ravazzini et al., 2019</a>). A possible solution would be to use tax data as the basis for the simulation, which proves to be very accurate regarding the documentation of wealth (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mart\u00ednez, 2022</a>). We did not choose this approach because tax data is not accessible for all cantons. Further, since the wealth tax burden is not explicitly included in the Swiss SILC data, we cannot simply include the burden in our output dataset, like in, e.g., the Spanish version of EUROMOD (<a href=\"#bib33\">Recio Alcaide et al., 2024</a>).

As previously mentioned, the actual number of recipients in 2023 was only 1,236 individuals across Switzerland (<a href=\"#bib48\">BSV, 2024</a>), making accurate representation in our dataset very challenging. The underestimation of family allowances is likely caused by our simplified simulation approach, which assumes a relatively low uniform benefit rate across all cantons, neglecting regional variations.

We also extend our sincere thanks to the European Commission for offering training opportunities in static microsimulation models, providing access to research infrastructure, and fostering international collaboration. An earlier version of this study was presented at the 9<sup>th</sup> World Congress of the International Microsimulation Association at the University of Vienna in 2024. We appreciate the valuable comments and suggestions from the participants at this event. We thank Bernhard Neum\u00e4rker, Tobias M\u00fcller and Justin Van De Ven for the professional exchange and helpful advice. Special thanks go to Martha Brinkmann for her excellent research assistance.",
