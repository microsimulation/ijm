The framework is designed to project life histories through time, building up a detailed picture of career paths, family (inter)relations, health, and financial circumstances. The modular nature of the SimPaths framework is designed to facilitate analysis of alternative assumptions concerning the tax and benefit system, sensitivity to parameter estimates and alternative approaches for projecting labour/leisure and consumption/savings decisions. SimPaths builds upon standardised assumptions and data sources, which facilitates adaptation to alternative countries \u2013 models based on the framework currently exist for the UK, Greece, Hungary, Italy, and Poland, and are under development for Germany, Spain and Sweden. Projections for a workhorse model parameterised to the UK context are reported, which closely reflect observed data throughout a validation window between the Financial crisis (2011) and the Covid-19 pandemic (2019).",

This sample window avoids complications associated with the 2008 Financial crisis on the one hand, and the Covid-19 pandemic on the other.

This, in turns, depends on the research questions that the model is designed to address, which should ultimately determine what validation tests the model has to pass. SimPaths is currently being used for a number of different research projects (see Section 5), with more applications being evaluated: a discussion of all the different research questions involved is therefore outside the scope of the present paper. Consequently, we opt here for a generic evaluation of how \u201crealistic\u201d the full set of model outcomes are, under a baseline parameterisation. Given the large number of state variables in the model, such a broad validation strategy spans multiple dimensions, covering both cross-sectional (evolution of summary statistics of variables over time) and longitudinal measures (transitions between states), referring both to individual variables and to their joint distribution (e.g. correlations).<sup><a href=\"#fn25\">25</a></sup> For the sake of brevity, we discuss here only a selection of cross-sectional measures, presented in graphical form for ease of visualisation, leaving validation of longitudinal measures to a future exercise. For each simulated series, 95% confidence bands are displayed, computed based on the uncertainty assessment strategy outlined in Section 3.11. The simulated confidence bands are shown against the weighted means of the corresponding variables computed on the UKHLS data.",

This implies a slower increase than observed in the data. This is partly attributable to a conservative choice about continuation of estimated trends in the projections. More in details, specifications assume a linear time trend. This is motivated by the relatively short length of the estimation panel, which would not support a more flexible modelling of the time trend. However, extrapolating a linear trend is problematic, as it will eventually lead to implausible levels of the variable of interest. In projections, SimPaths stops the estimated linear trends after a given calendar year. The default option \u2013 adopted in this and other processes - is to stop any estimated time trend at the end of the estimation sample (2017). Data shows that the trend towards increasing educational levels is continuing beyond 2017.",

This is potentially due to the fact that the underlying random utility model of labour supply is estimated on one cross section of data only (2017). Sensitivity analysis shows that estimating the model on previous years results in broadly constant coefficients, which is consistent with the assumed structural nature of the model. However, the data seems to suggest that preferences might have indeed changed slightly over time.",

Results show that the policy response prevented a further 3.4 percentage points (pp) increase in the prevalence of common mental disorders (CMDs) with respect to pre-covid levels, on top of the more than 10pp increase observed in 2020-2021 with covid-19 legislation in place.

The coincident costs of social care are projected to rise from \u00a335 billion in 2020 (1.6% of GDP) to 152 billion by 2070 (2.8% of GDP), with a large fraction of this cost being sustained by depleted savings.",

The latter will distinguish between housing, pensions, other assets and unsecured debt. Private transfers between households (e.g. parents helping with the home purchase of their children) will also be included, with implications for intergenerational fairness and the intergenerational transmission of inequality. Self-rated health and psychological distress are being replaced by the physical score component (PSC) and mental score component (MCS) respectively of the SF-12 health assessment. More health outcomes are also being added, including loneliness, nutrition, and tobacco consumption. Measures of neighbourhood safety and housing quality are being introduced as pathways between socio-economic position and health outcomes. A separate workstream looks at improving modelling of external migration, which is currently treated as a residual (see Section 3.1.1). Estimates are being updated to include more recent waves of the input data, account for migrant status and ethnicity, and improve the modelling of health outcomes (including mortality). Finally, as mentioned, some of these models have already been estimated (e.g., Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Spain and Sweden).",

A quick aside may, however, provide the reader with some appreciation for the issues involved. Empirical estimations of the equations that govern evolution of relationship status in the model were evaluated using pooled data from the UKHLS. From this basis, it was found that SimPaths tended to understate proportions of population projected to be in a relationship during the validation window. After further analysis, it was found that the discrepancy between the model and survey data was attributable to the interaction between the matching method used to identify partners from within the pool of simulated individuals identified as entering a relationship, and the probit relationships governing the incidence of relationship transitions. This type of mismatch reflects an issue that underlies any effort to identify parameters outside of a given model\u2019s structure. Ideally, all model parameters should be evaluated together and endogenous to the model of interest. This is the case, for example, in related two-stage econometric methods including Simulated Minimum Distance (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee and Ingram, 1991</a>), Method of Simulated Moments (<a href=\"#bib49\">Stern, 1997</a>), Indirect Estimation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gourieroux et al., 1993</a>), and Efficient Method of Moments (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gallant and Tauchen, 1996</a>). In practice that is often not possible, which generates a source of model mis-identification. In the current context, an alignment method was implemented to account for the model mismatch. The alignment method adjusts the intercept of the estimated probit equations governing the incidence of entering a relationship until the model reflects summary statistics for the proportions of the population observed in survey data to be in a relationship. For years beyond the validation period, the intercept is kept constant at the last calibrated level.",
