                "text": "Many microeconometric models of discrete choice include alternative-specific constants meant to account for (possibly besides other factors) the density or accessibility of particular types of alternatives. A notable area of application is labour supply, where for example part-time jobs vs. full-time jobs might be more or less accessible. The most common use of these models is the simulation of tax-transfer reforms. The simulation is usually interpreted as a comparative statics exercise, i.e. the comparison of different equilibria induced by different policy regimes. The simulation procedure, however, typically keeps fixed the estimated alternative-specific constants. In this note we argue that this procedure is not consistent with the comparative statics interpretation. Since the constants reflect the number of jobs and since the number of people willing to work changes as a response to the change in tax-transfer regime, the new equilibrium induced by the reform implies that the constants should also change. A structural interpretation of the alternative-specific constants leads to the development of a simulation procedure consistent with the comparative statics interpretation. The procedure is illustrated with a simulation of alternative reforms of the income support policies in Italy.",

When using the models for evaluating reforms of institutions or policies with long-run effects (such as tax-benefit reforms), comparative statics is the appropriate perspective: i.e. we want to compare two different equilibria induced by two different policies. With the notion of equilibrium we refer in general to a scenario in which the economic agents make optimal choices (i.e. they choose the best alternative among those available in the opportunity set) and their choices are mutually consistent or feasible. In what follows, we will make the specific assumption that mutual consistency of the agents\u2019s choices implies that the number of available jobs be equal to the number of workers willing to be matched to those jobs. To the extent that the alternative-specific constants reflect also the demand side (e.g. the availability of jobs), a new equilibrium induced by a reform should entail a change of the alternative-specific constants. Instead the standard simulation procedure leaves those constants unchanged: in this paper we argue that the standard procedure is not consistent with the comparative statics interpretation of the simulation results. Based on a structural interpretation of the alternative-specific constants, we propose a simulation procedure that is consistent with comparative statics.",

Then, since the {<i>\u03b3<sub>l</sub></i>} reflect \u2013 at least in part, depending on the interpretations \u2013 the number and the composition of available market jobs, and since the number of people willing to work and their distribution across different job types in general change as a consequence of the reforms, it follows that in general the {<i>\u03b3<sub>l</sub></i>} must also change. Moreover, if it is assumed that the mechanism leading to the equilibrium is a change of the wage rates, then the wage rates should change as well. sometimes the standard simulation procedure is interpreted as a long-term scenario with a perfectly elastic labour demand and therefore constant wage rates: even in this scenario, however, the {<i>\u03b3<sub>l</sub></i>} must change since in general the number of employed people and jobs do change.",

By adopting his approach and with sufficiently rich data on job characteristics, vacancies, individual productivities and job search activities, it might be possible to model and empirically identify the labour market equilibrium as a stable matching. However, in this exercise we follow a different route. Expression (<a href=\"#eqn4\">4</a>) is also compatible with alternative representations of the equilibrium process. First, we assume that any individual can in principle choose among all the jobs available on the market: the number of jobs of type <i>j</i> available to individual <i>i</i> is the same for everyone and is also equal to the total number of jobs of type <i>j</i> available on the market. Therefore <i>J</i>, the number of jobs available to individual <i>i</i>, is also the total number of available jobs. We might allow for different opportunity sets available to different types of individuals: for example in <a href=\"#s4-2\">Section 4.2</a> and in the empirical illustration of <a href=\"#s5\">Section 5</a> we will assume gender-specific individual opportunity sets. However it remains true in our assumptions that the opportunity set available to any individual of a given type coincide with total opportunity set available to that type. This is clearly a special assumption. In the more general case of strictly individual-specific opportunity sets (as in <a href=\"#bib15\">Dagsvik 2000</a>) there is no straightforward relationship between the number of jobs available to any particular individual and the total number of available jobs. Second, we adopt a simple, \u201ctextbook\u201d, concept of equilibrium. The equilibrium wage distribution (or equivalently, the equilibrium moment vector of the wage distribution) is such that the number of available market jobs of type <i>j</i> and the (expected) number of people who choose a job of type <i>j</i> are equal. The equilibrium means that there is a job of type <i>j</i> for everyone choosing a job of type <i>j</i>. The model does not explicitly represent the process by which individual <i>i</i> is allocated to a particular job among the jobs of type <i>j:</i> the random component <i>\u03b5<sub>ij</sub></i> (which accounts for the specific utility contribution of unobserved characteristics of individual <i>i</i> and/or jobs of type <i>j)</i> determines which specific job (among jobs of type <i>j</i>) is allocated to individual <i>i</i>.",

In terms of economic interpretation, they are consistent with a competitive scenario. In <a href=\"#s2\">Section 2</a> we have mentioned the possibility of empirically implementing, with appropriate data, more complex and general frameworks such as the one developed in <a href=\"#bib15\">Dagsvik (2000)</a>. However, even within the limits of the approach adopted in this paper, many extensions are feasible. For example one might depart from the competitive scenario and assume that the wage rates and the number of available jobs are set by the employers or the unions (collectively acting as a monopolist) or by a bargaining among them. Such alternative assumptions would of course require a suitable reformulation of the equilibrium conditions.",

This happens when the model includes a representation of aspects of the pre-reform equilibrium (such as the availability of different types of jobs) that are going to change in the post-reform equilibrium but these changes are not properly accounted for. We have proposed a simulation procedure that takes into account such changes and leads to a consistent interpretation of the simulation results as an exercise in comparative statics. We have adopted a very simple notion of equilibrium, but the same procedure can accommodate different and more complex ones. We have illustrated the relevance of the different simulation procedures with an evaluation of alternative reforms of the Italian income support policies.

EUROMOD is a tax-benefit microsimulation model for the European Union that enables researchers and policy analysts to calculate, in a comparable manner, the effects of taxes and benefits on household incomes and work incentives for the population of each country and for the EU as a whole. EUROMOD was originally designed by a research team under the direction of Holly Sutherland at the Department of Economics in Cambridge, UK. It is now developed and updated at the Microsimulation Unit at ISER (University of Essex, UK).",
