On behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ), the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology provided cost estimates on the basis of the microsimulation model MikMod-KiZ. This research note provides a short overview of the difficulties associated with the estimation of the short-term fiscal effects of this reform and the methodology used to construct both an appropriate database and to operationalise the microsimulation model. In fact, MikMod-KiZ consists of three independent static microsimulation models targeted at different groups of potential recipients, all using different data sources. One model is used to calculate the effects of policy changes on current recipients. A second model aims at low-income households with incomes above the level that qualifies for social welfare payments. The third focuses on those currently receiving social welfare benefits. Since the major objective of the reform was to entitle additional social welfare recipients to the KiZ, in the following we will describe the data and model used to estimate the reform effects on this specific group only.",

Because of the complex interactions with means tested social welfare benefits and housing allowances granted to non-needy low-income families, this leads to a situation where benefits are only granted to families within a very small income bracket. (For a more detailed description of the KiZ, see <a href=\"#bib1\">Knabe, 2005</a>.) As a consequence, the KiZ is granted to far less than 1 percent of German children.",

The major problem is that, since the major social welfare reform in 2005, there exists no accessible microdatabase with a focus on social welfare recipients. A representative large-scale sample that covers one fourth of all social welfare recipients is available only for the years before 2005. Despite the fact that it is already dated and therefore does not include information about a sizeable number of households which have become entitled to welfare benefits since the 2005 reform act, the major drawback of this database is that some of the data essential to calculate claims under current law is either missing or must be derived from partly incomplete data. However, due to the absence of alternative data sources, this sample forms the basis of our microsimulation model.",

Such a uniform distribution is broadly consistent with results taken from the latest German Income and Expenditure Survey. However, even if this imputation procedure may not capture all heating costs correctly, later data adjustments (described below in <a href=\"#s3\">Section 3</a>) minimize these possible errors.",

KiZ payments alone exceed social welfare payments only in a small number of cases.

However, the model design accounts for this fact. In a first step, the model calculates results for the given law. These results are stored in a special output-vector. In a second step, the policy reform is simulated but results are stored in a different output-vector. We then use a static aging approach (see e.g. <a href=\"#bib2\">Merz, 1986</a>) to adjust the results of the first simulation to available consolidated statistics on social welfare recipients. These statistics, covering the year 2007, come from the German Federal Employment Agency (BA) and provide information about the number and type (married or unmarried, number of children) of households within a certain income bracket as well as their social welfare benefits and housing costs. Case specific weighting factors in the microdatabase are then adjusted such that aggregated results stored in the first simulation round resemble the official numbers provided by the BA as good as possible. The algorithm used for this adjustment is programmed by Hermann Quinke. Based on the Minimum Information Loss Principle and employing the standard Newton-Raphson solution it is more or less identical to Merz\u2019s \u2018Adjust\u2019 reweighting algorithm (<a href=\"#bib3\">Merz, 1994</a>). The total number of restrictions put on the dataset within this adjustment process is 540.<a href=\"#fn1\"><sup>1</sup></a> A comparison between the adjusted microdata and the corresponding official statistics shows no statistically significant difference with respect to central tendencies as far as they are inferable from the aggregated official statistics. Using the adjusted weighting factors, the effects of the policy reform can then be immediately derived by aggregation of weighted differences in the two output-vectors.",

Therefore, our results had a large impact on the extent of the final reform. Subsequently, the model has been used to evaluate the impact of policy changes in different areas of the social security system that interact with the KiZ. Examples include changes in child allowances, housing allowances or (annual) increases in social welfare benefits. All this research is conducted on behalf of the BMFSFJ.",
