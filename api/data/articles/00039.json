It is particularly important as it is faster changing than other demographic processes such as fertility and mortality and so can impact upon the structure of the population quickly. In this paper we review methods that have been used by other models and describe the choices and methods used in the Pensim2 dynamic microsimulation model. In particular we model immigration flows, emigration flows and the overseas population. We divide our method into modelling how many migrate using external macro data and who emigrates, based upon micro processes.",

Fertility and especially mortality are relatively slow moving processes as they reflect long-term trends in society and in the health status of society. Migration, the flows of people into and out of a location, however changes relatively quickly in response to change in economic circumstances and in policy as witnessed by the recent entry of the new-entrant states to the EU. As a result this process can add significant uncertainty as to the size of the population and to population projections.",

Modelling demographic characteristics such as migration therefore is important within analytical programmes for evaluating and designing pension\u2019s policy reform such as dynamic microsimulation models. Migrants can be seen as a contributor to reducing the dependency ratio and improving the sustainability of the pensions system in OECD countries (See <a href=\"#bib18\">St\u00f8len, amd Texmon, 2007</a>). These immigrants, given the typical age profile may reduce the ratio of retirement to working age. However they themselves will build up future pension entitlements. In addition if one\u2019s focus is on trying to capture the financial cost of the pension system, also depending upon the design of the pension system, people may accumulate pension entitlement while working in a country and then be eligible for receipt of pensions while living overseas. As most dynamic microsimulation models have a single country focus, these people with pension entitlement are typically not covered in nationally focused microsimulation models.",

About 30% of emigrants are EU citizens. Overall there is a greater number of British nationals emigrating than immigrating with the gap reaching 126,000 in 2006. All other nationalities have positive net inflows, particularly in recent times for EU nationals. Most of the inflow and out-flow is concentrated in and around London, but there has been a slight trend since the mid 1990\u2019s for greater dispersal across the country of immigrants.",

One must then make an assumption as to how to disaggregate this net variable into these gross components. One possibility is to use historic ratios of emigration and immigration totals. However the question then is how to transform changes in the net migration totals to the gross migration totals. If net outward migration or net inward migration increases, then it may be reasonable to apply the ratio of the net migration to the gross migration totals to produce new estimated gross flows. However the difficulty occurs when the net migration total changes sign. In this case the ratio will be negative, having no sensible meaning in adjusting the gross control totals. Our solution is rather than concentrating on the level of the net totals, we focus on the absolute change in the net totals. Consider the following.",

In this graphic we consider the performance of our assumptions based upon a dataset that exhibited relatively small variations from 35,000 to 1,05,000 in the period 1991\u20131997, but increased rapidly to 1,50,000 to 2,25,000 in the 1998\u20132005 periods. In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, we consider in turn the assumption that (a) <i>k</i> depends upon the transition in the previous year, (b) that <i>k</i> depends upon the average transition over the period and (c) that <i>k</i> depends upon the value based upon 1991 transitions. We find that assumption (a) performs the best as the transitions year on year are smaller than over longer periods, while the average in (b) performs better than when <i>k</i> is based upon the 1991 transitions in (c). This is particularly noticeable in the 1998\u20132005 when there is greater volatility, but less important in the less volatile 1991\u20131997 period. This is not surprising as a sudden surge is likely to be as a result of either a large increase in immigration or emigration, due to an asymmetric shock such as immigration due to a war or entry of new states to the EU or emigration due to a downturn in the national economy. We would therefore argue for <i>k</i> based upon the shortest time, the lag order one.",

They may themselves bring with them other dependants such as children and spouses. Therefore as for emigrants we face the issue that the relevant unit of analysis is wider than the individual.

In other words the total number of immigrants depends upon the Office for National Statistics (ONS) individual level population statistics, while we desire benefit units to immigrate together. Therefore cloning is not simply the case of taking a random sample of individual immigrants and bringing them into the model, we need to take a random sample of immigrant families and ensure that the numbers of individuals are consistent with the external control totals. These individual control totals can themselves be decomposed into sub-groups such as age-sex-nationality further complicating the process. As outlined above, we need to distinguish between UK-national immigrants and non-UK national immigrants on the grounds of location and thus pension entitlement while abroad to produce the consistency with the emigration module. Also native and non native immigrants have quite different characteristics. For example native reimmigrants tend to be older than non-native immigrants. Therefore, we store two immigration samples to clone individuals, containing (a) a sample of UK-national immigrants and their UK and non-UK national dependants and (b) a sample of non UK national immigrants.

The method builds on methodologies used in other models, particularly in Sweden, Canada and Australia and focuses in particular on defining the algorithms used. We hope that these algorithms will prove useful to other model builders. Our migration module consisted of a number of parts. Firstly immigration was modelled using a sampling routine from an external sample of British and non-British migrants.",

Emigrants move into an external pool of emigrants who are then subjected to a sub-set of processes in order to be able to model pension expenditure amongst pensioners living abroad. Unlike the domestic pensioners, at present it is not possible to model the relative welfare of these pensioners as we neither model other family members and family formation, nor do we model other income sources. However the model is useful in capturing future liability for pensions paid to overseas pensioners and to assess the cost of pension reforms for this group.",

(2002</a>) describe the situation of migrants in the UK, highlighting that immigrants tend to be younger, more like to be in work, but also likely to be both in the highest paid professions and the lowest paid professions, but less represented in the middle of the distribution. New immigrants are also more educated than older immigrants. Also there is quite a significant wage gap between immigrants and UK born. However for background information, it would be useful to have a handle on the extent to which migrant and non-migrant histories differ, even if only to provide some contextual background for simulations.",

However <a href=\"#bib5\">Duleep and Dowha (2008c</a>) acknowledge that this approach from the point of view of simulating migrant earnings is problematical. It is likely to misrepresent the earnings profiles of migrants. They also recommend that in estimating models of migrant earnings, that separate equations should be estimated for migrants rather than simply including dummy variables in existing earnings regression models. This recommendation is likely to apply to other components of the labour market as well. Therefore it is hoped to improve this aspect in future developments of the model.",
