This field has progressed significantly in recent times, so this paper is a timely summary of the current methods.",

This paper also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, but from an applied perspective, rather than the methodological perspective provided in Paper 2. This paper makes an important contribution to the literature in the spatial microsimulation area by bringing all the applications together in one paper, and is a starting point for anyone wanting to know what work has been done before in a particular application of spatial microsimulation.",

The paper was initially presented at the First International Microsimulation Conference in 2007, and was finally edited and submitted to the journal in 2013. The paper is important in outlining the differences between these two approaches, and highlighting the different results achieved through them.",

It describes recent innovative work on bringing together a CGE model, a Tax/Transfer microsimulation model and a spatial microsimulation model. This allows the researcher to look at the small area impacts of a macro-economic shock to the economy. This research is very much at the cutting edge of spatial microsimulation research, but from first looks, the link is possible, and it provides plausible results.",

In this paper, the information on each of the buildings has then been used to estimate heat consumption taking into account the occupants of the buildings, but as the authors conclude, the range of questions that can be analysed with a synthetic population allocated to buildings is extensive.",

The innovation of this paper is the use of local cultural factors to achieve better predictions from a projections model. In particular, fertility is known to be lower for French speakers and English speakers in the city compared to suburbs, but not for those where the first language is not French or English, where the fertility rate is higher in the city than the suburbs. This paper uses the detail available in a spatial microsimulation model to provide more realistic population projections into the future.",
