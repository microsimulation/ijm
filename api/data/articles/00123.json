Indeed, devising effective policy interventions requires appropriate ex-ante evaluation instruments, not only informative about the macro-level revenue consequences, but also about the distributional outcomes of specific interventions. In this respect, and particularly in a single-country framework, the accuracy of a particular model in accounting for aspects that are more salient in the national context, or the object of planned reform interventions, is key to its predictive power and, therefore, relevance.",

The first is tax evasion, which is extremely high, i.e. estimated in the range of 18\u201325% of G<span class=\"small-caps\">dp</span> in terms of unreported incomes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Giovannini, 2011</a>). Various political leaders, as well as a significant share of the public opinion, seem to justify tax evaders on the grounds that tax rates are too high and the tax schedule far too progressive. At the same time, the distributional consequences of tax evasion are often neglected in the public discourse, or dismissed with generic statements based more on anecdotal evidence than grounded empirical analysis. For example, little is known about the distinct effects that tax evasion may bear to progressivity (vertical effect) versus horizontal equity and re-ranking (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aronson &amp; Lambert, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Urban &amp; Lambert, 2008</a>). Microsimulation models have a major potential in this respect. The second aspect is that of tax expenditures. Over the last decade, tax expenditures in Italy have consistently increased as a share of G<span class=\"small-caps\">dp</span>. Recently, the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance identified 720 measures of tax expenditures that account for about the per cent of G<span class=\"small-caps\">dp</span> (<a href=\"#bib24\">Keen <i>et al</i>., 2012</a>). Among these, the individual income tax expenditures are the largest (4.84% of G<span class=\"small-caps\">dp</span>). Because of the entailed reduction in tax revenues, and the induced distortions in taxpayers\u2019 behavior, there is an increasing debate, both at the national and international level, on the use of tax expenditures as alternative to direct expenditures (e.g. see <a href=\"#bib3\">Avram, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Burman, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Burman <i>et al</i>., 2008</a>; Poterba, 2011; <a href=\"#bib36\">Tyson, 2014</a>), also on the grounds of their regressive effect (e.g. <a href=\"#bib26\">Matsaganis &amp; Flevotomou, 2007</a>).",

In more detail, B<span class=\"small-caps\">etamod</span> improves on the existing Italian models<a href=\"#fn1\"><sup>1</sup></a> by estimating a distribution of individual tax evasion rates, based on total individual income level, its composition in terms of sources, and geographical area. With respect to other Italian models, where tax evasion rates are assumed to be constant within population subgroups (e.g. by income source type, by income classes), B<span class=\"small-caps\">etamod</span>, assigns a tax evasion rate to each individual. This allows to evaluate more accurately how tax evasion may alter the redistributive effect of personal income taxation, and to measure the horizontal, vertical and re-ranking effects, each of which is possibly altered by tax evasion. Moreover, B<span class=\"small-caps\">etamod</span> accounts thoroughly for a detailed set of tax allowances and tax credits. Compared to the majority of current microsimulation models for Italy, B<span class=\"small-caps\">etamod</span> includes all kinds of individual income tax expenditures and allows us to estimate the distributional effects of all tax expenditures simultaneously and of specific tax reliefs or categories of expenditure in turn.",

In the individual level questionnaire, besides information on education, health and occupation, detailed information on individual\u2019s income from various sources relevant for tax base assessment (employment, self-employment, old age and disability pensions, incapacity and disability benefits, rents from properties, investment income and other incomes) is covered. For income components subject to taxation<a href=\"#fn4\"><sup>4</sup></a>, the amount as net of taxes (and of social insurance contributions, where applicable) is collected, because net amounts are generally regarded as less exposed to measurement error and recall bias than gross ones. Reflecting the structure of the Italian fiscal system, where incomes earned in the solar year <i>t</i> are taxed in the following (<i>t+1</i>), the reference period in income-related questions is the previous fiscal year, that is 2010. This represents a mismatch with respect to demographic information, which reflects the situation of households at the time when the fieldwork was carried out (i.e. March and April 2011), and which has therefore been brought backward to 2010.",

Drawing from the same survey, we also impute insurance premiums and house refurbishments expenditures, relevant for the computation of specific, and quantitatively important, tax reliefs. Imputation from S<span class=\"small-caps\">hiw</span> has been performed using statistical matching techniques, where S<span class=\"small-caps\">hiw</span> individuals have acted as \u2018donors\u2019 of the otherwise missing information for I<span class=\"small-caps\">t</span>-S<span class=\"small-caps\">ilc</span> observed \u2018recipients\u2019. Matching aims at selecting, for each I<span class=\"small-caps\">t</span>-S<span class=\"small-caps\">ilc</span> recipient, the S<span class=\"small-caps\">hiw</span> donor that is closest to observational identity, i.e. the most similar in terms of characteristics, observed in both surveys that are predictive of the variable to be imputed. The quality of the matching procedure relies crucially on a so-called <i>common support</i> requirement of overlapping in the distribution of predictive characteristics in the donors\u2019 and recipients\u2019 samples, which has been empirically tested. The matching procedure we have adopted is based on a combination of stratification and Mahalanobis distance nearest neighbor algorithm (<a href=\"#bib33\">Rubin, 1980</a>). Matching has been performed at the household level and with replacement, that is allowing the same S<span class=\"small-caps\">hiw</span> household to act as donor for multiple I<span class=\"small-caps\">t</span>-S<span class=\"small-caps\">ilc</span> households, if deemed as the most adequate, rather than being discarded after having served once as donor. The donors\u2019 and recipients\u2019 samples have been stratified by main residence homeownership, other properties homeownership and geographical area, so that exact matching on these variables is ensured; then, within each stratum, the donor household has been selected based on the Mahalanobis distance metric, measured on other predictive variables. These include equivalent household income, the percentage of household members with more than upper secondary educational qualification, a set of household composition dummies, and the main earner\u2019s employment status. The quality of matching has been gauged by investigating the balance (e.g. in terms of equality in means) in predictive variables between recipients and matched donors, and the procedure adjusted as long as achieved balance was deemed unsatisfactory. More detail on the implementation of the matching- based imputation, and the achieved balance, is reported in Appendix A.",

Secondly, when taxpayers are compared by quantiles of net incomes, a problem of re-ranking may arise. In fact, with respect to the distribution of after-tax income recorded in the survey, tax evasion shifts downwards individuals in the distribution of net income in the official data, so that, especially at low-income classes, the tax evasion rates are over-estimated. To overcome these drawbacks, B<span class=\"small-caps\">etamod</span> estimates tax evasion rates as the percentage differences between the true gross incomes (as resulting from the net-to-gross conversion module) and the reported incomes declared to fiscal authorities. Clearly, since the true gross income is unknown and it is the results of the net-to gross procedure, tax evasion may be affected by approximations that depends on the estimation method.",

The design of each evasion-by-income profile results from an optimizing procedure, which aims at minimizing the distance between simulated and administrative reported income.

In addition, tax rules require some taxpayers to report a zero gross tax liability even if it is in fact positive: this applies for example to pensioners with gross income (excluding the cadastral return on main residence) lower than 7,5 thousands euros, or to taxpayers whose only income, if lower than 500 euros, is that from buildings.",

Since the tax credit is decreasing in income, the B<span class=\"small-caps\">etamod</span> tax credit results greater than in tax returns data. As to the dependent family members tax credit, the striking similarity in the number of beneficiaries is motivated by this variable having been taken into account in the weighting design, while the simulated amount of tax credit is -4.0% lower than the official figure, presumably reflecting the sample distribution of household composition, relevant for identification of dependants. The other most sizeable tax credits, namely healthcare expenditures, house refurbishment, energy interventions and mortgage interest tax credits are remarkably close to the administrative figures.

Overall, the B<span class=\"small-caps\">etamod</span> distributions are strikingly similar to the fiscal data ones, especially in the classes of reported income where most of taxpayers fall (12\u201326 thousands of euros). Such pattern of similarity is confirmed when considering the distribution of average gross and net tax liabilities across income classes (<a href=\"#table9\">Table 9</a>).

Again, the similarity between the two is striking, and is also confirmed for other tax allowances (the related figures are reported in Appendix C).

The effect of tax evasion is mainly due to its negative income gradient, reducing gross income more at the lower end of the distribution. The exemption of imputed rent increases progressivity since this figurative income component is proportionally more sizeable for lower income taxpayers. On the other hand, deductions have an inequality enhancing impact, plausibly motivated by the proportional effect of social insurance contributions on the self-employed being offset by pro-rich pattern of personal expenses. Not surprisingly, the tax schedule exhibits a major progressivity effect. It is tax credits though that are the most important determinant of progressivity, their contribution amounting to about 58% of overall progressivity. This is mostly driven by income-source and dependent family members tax credits, whose design entails positive withdrawal rates as taxable income increases. Other tax credits, subsidizing personal spending on a wide range of goods and services, including housing, healthcare and education, while less sizeable, do display a regressive effect.",

As a result of non-compliance, the taxpayers in the bottom income class, for instance, moves from about 10% when considering true gross income to about 14% when considering reported income relevant for taxation. Evaders who enter the bottom income class come from the 2nd to the 8th income class (up to 29 thousands of euros), rather than from higher income classes, reflecting the decreasing income profile of tax evasion rates. Moving to the upper classes, we observe a similar pattern of shifts across income classes, although the number of shifts is progressively reduced, again because of the negative income gradient in tax evasion.

First, two constraints need be satisfied to make matching feasible: (i) the two surveys must be random samples from the same population; (ii) there must be a common set of conditioning variables. In our case, the first condition is met by design, since both the IT-SILC 2011 and the SHIW 2012 data are representative of the Italian population. As far as the second constraint is concerned, the variables (X) common to each dataset and chosen for the process of imputation of self-reported asset value of the main residence, insurance premiums and house refurbishments expenditures are: equivalent household income, the percentage of household members with more than upper secondary educational qualification, a set of household composition dummies, and the main earner\u2019s employment status. The final sample is made up of 7.951 households from the SHIW survey and 19.399 households from the IT-SILC Survey.",

In order to obtain a more precise matching, the sample was stratified in cells according to the main residence homeownership, other properties homeownership and geographical area so that exact matching on these variables is ensured; then, within each stratum, the donor household has been selected based on the Mahalanobis distance metric, measured on the other X variables. The Mahalanobis metric is a measure of dissimilarity between observation which measures the distance between units i from the recipient dataset IT-SILC and j from the donor dataset SHIW weighting each coordinate of X in inverse proportion to the variance of that coordinate:",

Once the matching procedure was complete, we check the quality of the matching. The quality of matching was evaluated in terms of maintaining the asset value of the main residence, insurance premiums and house refurbishments expenditures distributions, both in terms of preserving the pre-existing variables distribution as well as in terms of pre-existing relations between variables of interest.",

The differences between the common-fusion correlations in the S<span class=\"small-caps\">hiw</span> data set versus the fused I<span class=\"small-caps\">t</span>-S<span class=\"small-caps\">ilc</span> data set were well preserved for most variables.

Before matching we expect differences, after matching the variables should be balanced in both groups and significant differences should not persist. The covariate balancing test, included in <a href=\"#tableA-1\">Table A1</a>, shows that the matching is effective in removing differences in observable characteristics between the recipients and matched donors. In particular, the median absolute bias is reduced by approximately 82%-98%. The Pseudo R-squared after matching is always close to zero, correctly suggesting that the covariates have no explanatory power in the matched samples. The chi-square test conducted before and after matching, proves that the propensity score removed bias due to differences in covariates between the recipients and matched donors.",
