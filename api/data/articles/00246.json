The model is simulated to analyze the impact of policy changes not only on mean behavior but also on the entire distribution of target variables. Micro simulation models have thus, for instance, been used to analyze how changes in the income taxes influence the tails of the income distribution (the incidence of poverty). Micro simulation complements a more traditional economic analysis. It is demanding in terms of modeling effort, data requirements and computer capacity. The issues of statistical inference related to micro simulation are in principle no different from those in econometric modeling generally. In practice the large scale and complex structure of a typical micro simulation model and the shortage of good micro data raise inference issues of particular relevance for micro simulation such as the choice of estimation criteria, calibration to benchmarks and model validation. Much in current practice does not meet high scientific standards, but there is a potential for a promising research program.",

This is the art of model building and of using \u201crhetoric\u201d to convince fellow economists and policy makers of the benefits of a particular model<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup>. The only advice the econometrician can give is to put the model to the test of data using our battery of diagnostic tests. There is, however, no foolproof procedure to follow to the \u201ctrue\u201d model. For a given finite sample many models will pass the diagnostic tests and with very large samples almost every model would become rejected. The existence of a true data generating process is a useful assumption made by the econometrician to be able to discuss properties of econometric methods, but it is not really needed in economic analysis. What is important is to find a model that is useful for a particular purpose. In the search for such a model one might be willing to neglect less important deviations between model and data and accept certain properties of the model even if diagnostic tests would reject them. The economist must, however, be able to show that these properties are of no consequence or at least \u201cless important\u201d for his purpose. Some analysts take this kind of argument as an excuse to fit very simple structures to data and to neglect the diagnostic testing. This is not well advised. Diagnostic tests that signal likely specification errors are always warnings to be taken seriously and we usually prefer an economic model, which fits data better than a model that does not fit as well.",

Aggregation is thus no simple adding up but involves the interaction of micro units on markets and under institutional constraints. To set up a research program which permits not only random but also nonrandom heterogeneity in the behavior of economic agents, that allow them to interact in various ways and that also allow the explicit introduction of institutional constraints and policy parameters, a new framework is needed.

Each micro unit is defined and characterized by a set of properties (variables) and as the model is simulated these properties are updated for each and every micro unit. The model might simply be a set of deterministic rules such as the income tax rules of a country operating on a sample of taxpayers and used to compute the distribution of after-tax income, the aggregate income tax revenue or other fiscal entities of interest.

It stimulates the researcher to pay attention to the institutional circumstances that constrain the behavior of consumers and firms. It also in a straightforward way suggests what data should be collected and from whom. Similarly, in a micro simulation model it is possible to include the true policy parameters and the rules which govern their use, such as the tax rate scales, eligibility rules, tax thresholds, etc. One is not confined to using average tax rates applied to everyone.

One is Guy Orcutt\u2019s idea about mimicking natural experiments also in economics and his development of the behavioral dynamic micro simulation model DYNASIM<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> that later was further developed by Steven Caldwell into the CORSIM model (<a href=\"#bib1\">Caldwell, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Caldwell, 1996</a>). Another source is the increased interest among policy makers for distributional studies. Changes in the tax systems of many Western economies has developed a need for a tool to analyze who will win and who will loose from changes in the tax and benefit systems. As a result, many governments now have so called tax-benefit models. Examples are the Danish LAW model, the UK model POLIMOD<sup><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup> , STINMOD<sup><a href=\"#fn4\">4</a></sup> in Australia, SWITCH<sup><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup> in Ireland, and FASIT<sup><a href=\"#fn6\">6</a></sup> in Sweden. At the European level EUROMOD is an ambitious attempt to build a tax-benefit model for all of EU<sup><a href=\"#fn7\">7</a></sup> These models usually do not include behavioral relations but only all the details of the tax and benefit rules. These rules are then applied to a sample of individuals for which one knows all gross incomes and everything else needed to compute taxes and benefits. For every individual in the sample one is thus able to compute the sum of all (income) taxes due and the disposable income for each household. The output becomes, for instance, the distribution of the disposable income. It is then possible to change the tax rates or anything else in the tax code and run the model once again and compare to the previous result. In this way one can analyze who will gain and who will loose from a tax change and estimate the aggregate budget effects of tax and benefit changes. The simulation model will, however, only give the first-order effect of a tax change, because household composition, work hours and incomes are assumed unchanged and not influenced by the taxes. This is both a strength and a weakness of the tax-benefit models. It is a strength because it is easy to understand what the model does, and no controversial assumptions are needed. There is also no difficult inference problem. All the analyst needs to do is to draw an inference from the random sample of taxpayers to the population of taxpayers, which is something we know from sampling theory. The weakness is of course that we do not know the relative size of any adjustments of behavior to the tax and benefit changes. Many tax reforms aim at changing the behavior of taxpayers. The first-order effect might then become a bad approximation. As a result, attempts have been made to enlarge the tax-benefit models with behavioral models to capture these adjustments. <a href=\"#bib5\">Duncan and Weeks (1997)</a> gives an example of a tax-benefit model amended with a labor supply model. Additional examples can be found in <a href=\"#bib18\">Klevmarken (1997)</a> Table 3. In this way the tax-benefit models approach Orcutt\u2019s DYNASIM and its successors.",

Although the supply of micro data has increased very much in the last 20-30 years it is still hardly possible to find one data source or one sample which will contribute all the information needed for a typical microsimulation model. In fact, many model builders have found it necessary to use guestimates of model parameters and then try to calibrate the model against known benchmarks. Calibration is nothing but an attempt to tune the unknown parameters such that the model is able to simulate reasonably well the distributions of key variables. In this respect there is a similarity between microsimulation modeling and general equilibrium modeling. Both rely too often on the calibration technique. <a href=\"#bib14\">Hansen and Heckman (1996)</a> criticized this approach because they found too little emphasis on assessing the quality of the resulting estimates.

Instead, we might prefer to get a representation of the distributions of \u201cresiduals\u201d by resampling from the empirical residual distributions. b) In some cases, for instance when the distributions of income and wealth are simulated, we have to work with strongly skewed and highly non-normal distributions. c) A typical microsimulation model includes a rather complex mixture of different submodels, functional forms and dependence assumptions, such that it might become difficult to set up a likelihood function.",

As already mentioned, we are not only interested in good mean predictions, but also in good representations of cross-sectional distributions and of transitions between states. When an event occurs becomes important in any dynamic microsimulation exercise. A micro-simulation model is likely to have a number of simplifying assumptions about lack of correlation and independence, both between individuals and over time.
