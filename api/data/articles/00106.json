                "text": "While the direct costs of mortality to the health care system are known to be significant, there is less information regarding the wider economic impacts of mortality including the implications for productivity, household incomes and government revenue. This paper outlines the development of LifeLossMOD, a new microsimulation model to estimate the economic impacts of premature mortality in Australia. The model is based on a census of 2003 mortality records and applies projections from the APPSIM microsimulation model to estimate the counterfactual lifetime trajectories forgone to the year 2030. We estimated that mortality in 2003 accounted for over 280,000 full time working years lost to the Australian economy. Future applications of LifeLossMOD will explore the distributional impacts of mortality on employment, GDP, government revenue and household income, wealth and retirement savings. These estimates will allow decision makers and others to more accurately determine the full economic impacts of mortality by cause. In addition, the model will be able to quantify the financial gains likely to accrue with preventative health care interventions, which can in turn be reported on in cost effectiveness analyses.",

However, there is relatively little information on the economic impacts of premature mortality that occur outside the health system, including the impacts on productivity and government revenue. This is despite studies finding that the productivity related costs of disease can far outweigh the direct health care costs, in some cases accounting for over 80% of the total costs of illness (<a href=\"#bib21\">Max, Rice <i>et al.</i> 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Max, Sung <i>et al.</i> 2009</a>).",

The results of LifeLossMOD will allow decision makers and others to determine the economic impacts of premature mortality, as well as the financial gains that would accrue with interventions able to prevent particular conditions, and thus mortality due to that condition.

This generalisation does not take into account evidence that both income and type of illness differ by age, sex, education and occupation. For example, a higher degree is related to 100% higher earnings in later working life (<a href=\"#bib16\">Johnson &amp; Lloyd 2000</a>).

The burden of disease study applied projected disease trends to the 2001 deaths in order to reflect the likely distribution of deaths by cause in 2003. A total of 131,495 mortality records were extracted from the adjusted dataset, of which 68,704 were classified as occurring prematurely (that is, before the age of 80); these records formed the base population of LifeLossMOD. Each mortality record contained variables describing the cause of death as well as the individual\u2019s age, sex and SEIFA quintile. SEIFA is a metric developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) that summarises a range of information about the economic and social conditions of people and households within a given geographic area. It then ranks areas in Australia according to relative socio-economic advantage and disadvantage (<a href=\"#bib42\">Trewin 2003</a>).

The major drawback was its limited nature in terms of the key outcomes we wished to model, including labour force participation, income and wealth. In order to overcome this limitation, it was necessary to impute estimates of relevant variables onto the mortality records. This was achieved using data from the APPSIM model.",

The primary reason for matching the mortality dataset to APPSIM, as opposed to merely applying mortality risks to APPSIM records, was to account for the socio-economic factors that influence both the type of illness an individual may experience, as well as the likelihood of death. The SEIFA variable in the mortality dataset was able to provide this information on an individual level, which once matched to records in APPSIM was able to greatly enhance the variability in the model.",

Due to the enhanced matching power that a SEIFA variable would be able to provide in terms of accurately assigning labour force and income data to the mortality dataset, we first imputed SEIFA indexes onto the APPSIM records.

The variables in common between APPSIM and the SIH that were most consistent with the final outcomes we wished to model were identified, these being the household income quintile, household wealth quintile and individual labour force status. For every combination of these variables, the proportion of SIH records falling in to each SEIFA quintile was calculated. A Monte Carlo process was then used to assign a SEIFA quintile to each APPSIM record based on these underlying distributions. The reason why a Monte Carlo process was used in this instance, rather than simply allocating the most likely SEIFA quintile to an individual with a given combination of characteristics, was due to the inherent variability within the SEIFA index itself. As SEIFA is an area-based index, individuals across the full spectrum of socio-economic characteristics may appear within each quintile. The Monte Carlo process was able to allow for some less likely SEIFA allocations occur, as is consistent with how this index is allocated in practice.",

Firstly, individual records in both the 2003 mortality dataset and the 2003 APPSIM population were grouped into homogenous cells, or \u2018bins\u2019, based on their combination of five year age category, sex and SEIFA quintile. Approximately 0.9% of mortality records were excluded due to a missing SEIFA variable. In the second step, each mortality record within a particular bin was linked with an individual from the APPSIM dataset that appeared in the same bin. As the APPSIM dataset contained records across all possible bins, the matching process was able to be performed with 100% accuracy such that distributions of income and employment variables by age, sex and SEIFA quintile were identical within both APPSIM and LifeLossMOD. Where there were multiple APPSIM records in the same bin as an individual mortality record, matching was performed randomly with replacement, consistent with the \u2018unconstrained matching\u2019 approach described by Rassler (<a href=\"#bib30\">R\u00e4ssler 2002</a>). Under this process, the same record in APPSIM could be synthetically matched with multiple mortality records. To allow for the effects of uncertainty in the linking of records, the matching process was performed on each of the 100 APPSIM datasets described above, to create 100 uniquely matched datasets, henceforth referred to as LifeLossMOD.",
