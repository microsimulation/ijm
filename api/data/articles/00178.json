This is particularly relevant for EUROMOD, the tax-benefit microsimulation model for the European Union, because it is intended to be widely used. This paper explains how the quality of EUROMOD is assessed. It focusses on the validity and scope of results as particularly important dimensions of quality, and on the transparency with which this assessment is done. It also provides evidence on the extent and breadth of the use of EUROMOD. Some of the key trade-offs between different aspects of quality are identified and the paper concludes with a view on the appropriate division of responsibility for quality assessment, between model developers and users.",

There are many potentially relevant dimensions of \u201cquality\u201d and their importance depends on the particular exercise being carried out. The dimensions that are feasible to assess meaningfully are limited to those for which there are independent benchmarks, standards or expectations against which to compare. There are many varieties of microsimulation models with different purposes and underlying methodologies and technologies (<a href=\"#bib32\">O\u2019Donoghue, 2014</a>). All of this means that it is difficult to discuss quality in abstract or general terms. To provide a concrete focus, this paper refers explicitly to the quality assessment of one particular model, EUROMOD, the tax-benefit microsimulation model for the European Union (EU). It concentrates on one important, generally applicable dimension of quality: the validity and scope of results. EUROMOD has a long-standing tradition of being made openly available to the academic and policy community. The result is a well-developed set of practices and protocols for ensuring high quality. Given this, the paper also presents some evidence giving an indirect outcome indicator of EUROMOD\u2019s quality: the extent and breadth of its use.",

It is a statement of model quality, especially focussed on the validity and scope of results, for users to refer to.

This is particularly relevant as responsibility for EUROMOD\u2019s updating and maintenance transfers from an academic setting at the University of Essex to the European Commission.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> It provides an opportunity to pass on the lessons we have learned not only to those who will take over, but also to the wider microsimulation community.",

This is done either for an existing policy system or a reform specified by the user using a purpose-built user interface and tax-benefit calculation language.

The EU-SILC has an annual reference period but administrative statistics often count recipients at a point in time. Thirdly, the administrative statistics may not refer to the same distinct instruments or income components that are itemised in EUROMOD. They may refer to sub-instruments or to combinations of several instruments. In some cases, they are only available with a long time delay and in others they are not made publicly available at all. Furthermore, the process of validation is cumulative. If there is a problem with one income component, this will also affect the precision of simulation of the components which rely on it. As an example, if earnings are under-reported in the survey, not only will social insurance contributions be under-estimated, but so will be the size of any tax relief on the contributions. Income taxes will be over-estimated for this reason, but at the same time under-estimated because of the under-reporting of earnings.

This is only unnecessary if all the components can be fully simulated by EUROMOD or if none of them can and they are all treated in the same way by the rest of the tax-benefit system. The simplest solution leading to the highest quality results is if it is possible to combine the disaggregated components from the national version of the EU-SILC with the UDB.

First, suitable external statistics, especially for the most recent year, may only be available with some delay. Secondly, the projection itself is subject to some error. Input data are projected forward to a recent or current policy year by inflating income sources using specific indexes (see the Country Reports for detail and <a href=\"#bib17\">EUROMOD (2018b)</a> for the principles behind these adjustments).

The first is to match administrative statistics derived from the process of the collection of income tax, so (ideally) taking into account evasion as well as avoidance in the simulations. The second is to measure income tax liabilities, assuming full compliance within the reporting period, which would typically imply a larger amount than captured by tax administration statistics, but which is difficult to validate due to lack of external information.

However, the interpretation of comparisons across countries is aided by country-by-country documentation available with standardised format and content, as is provided in the Country Reports. In general, comparability cannot be established by looking at the results and must be assessed through qualitative examination of inputs, protocols and processes intended to ensure comparable treatments. This means that protocols and processes must be documented and their implementation in practice monitored and reviewed.

An accompanying commentary explains which specific policy changes (or lack of changes: the calculations assume a counterfactual indexation by CPI) are responsible for the picture shown. While this analysis does not provide hard evidence that the effects of changes in policies are simulated accurately, it is a powerful plausibility check since national experts (authors of the Country Reports) as well as the Essex EUROMOD development team are involved in explaining the changes.

First, a model that is shown to capture the effects of taxes and benefits on the household income distribution in an accurate and precise way in the baseline may not measure the effect of changes so well (and the reverse may alternatively be the case). Calibrations and adjustments that force baseline results to match some external requirement (such as National Accounts aggregates) may distort distributions of relevant baseline variables to the extent that the effects of changes are less well captured than without the calibration. Secondly, broadening the policy scope of simulation and hence the questions that can be addressed by the model, must be balanced with the quality of the estimates that may be achieved using extensive imputations and assumption. Thirdly, comparability of results across countries may be to some extent at odds with maximising quality in any one country, given the different tax-benefit policy systems and their varying requirements from the input data (and, potentially, varying quality of input data). This trade-off between quality and comparability is one key aspect of appreciating how to assess the quality of EUROMOD.",

This illustrates how a quality assessment for one purpose may not be generally applicable and that much of the responsibility for relevant quality assessment of results from EUROMOD necessarily rests with the users of the model rather than its developers. The responsibility of the developers is to provide in the public domain (i) basic quality assessments that are fully documented, explained and the results interpreted, (ii) information on the principles and processes involved in constructing the model, including the approach to key trade-offs between different dimensions of quality, and (iii) transparency when assumptions have been made or there are choices for the user.",

This statement of purpose can be seen as an important component of a comprehensive quality profile. In the case of a multi-use and multi-user model, such as EUROMOD, this is not straightforward to define, since new unanticipated applications may always be developed. Nevertheless, <a href=\"#s2\">Section 2</a> of this paper includes an attempt to describe the purpose of EUROMOD. The trade-offs are (deliberately) not all resolved by EUROMOD\u2019s developers and many choices can and should be made by the user. Thus some of the dimensions of quality that are particularly salient in the case of EUROMOD may be those not considered in any detail here, such as its transparency, flexibility, timeliness and the user experience in general. Assessment of these is the subject of further work, as is EUROMOD itself.",
