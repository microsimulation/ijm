The paper features an integrated CGE microsimulation model with explicit incorporation of non-market activities and gender decomposition. This makes it possible to assess the effects of trade liberalization on between and within-group poverty, as well as on gender-disaggregated household production and leisure. The findings reveal that trade liberalization is strongly gender biased against women.",

Indeed, the country exhibits much higher poverty than expected for a country with its level of per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Poverty has a strong gender dimension, showing that female-headed households have a 50 percent higher poverty rate than male-headed households. In addition, unemployment figures have shown that females suffer more from unemployment than males. This context makes it imperative to deal with the phenomenon of gender poverty.",

By 1994 when the country officially became reintegrated into the global system following a successful transition from apartheid policies towards democracy, most quantitative restrictions had been removed, although quantitative restrictions on agricultural products were still in place. In the same year, the country signed the Marrakech Agreement under the Uruguay Round of the GATT. Essentially, this involved removal of quantitative restrictions, export incentives and a reduction in the number of tariff lines. Government agreed to binding 98 percent of all tariff lines, reducing the number of tariff lines to six, rationalising the twelve thousand commodity lines and replacing quantitative restrictions on agriculture by tariff equivalents. South Africa has made a lot of progress towards meeting these commitments implying that there has been substantial trade liberalisation. Average tariff rates have been halved.",

Some sectors are male-intensive (i.e. mining, food, beverage and tobacco, heavy manufacturing and construction), while others are female-intensive (i.e. textile, and private services). Women are engaged primarily in tertiary activities, while men are spread throughout primary and secondary sectors. Unemployment rates for women are much higher than for men. This is true for all population groups, especially in urban areas where unemployment was estimated at over 28 percent for women, compared to 24.1 percent for men. Higher female unemployment may be explained, inter alia, by lower education and literacy rates. In situations of declining demand during the liberalized and deflationary period, women were pushed into the informal sector.",

The model assumes profit maximization among producers and utility maximisation among consumers. Relative prices then adjust simultaneously in such a way that the markets clear. In addition, the model distinguishes between male and female workers as well as market and non market activities, thereby resulting in a gender-aware model. The gender-aware integrated micro-macro model is constructed in several steps. First a standard Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) is constructed using the Supply and Use Tables (<a href=\"#bib6\">Statistics South Africa, 2003</a>) and the integrated economic accounts for South Africa, both for 2000. Second, labour market segmentation between male and female workers is incorporated into the standard SAM. These are considered as different factors of production in the same way workers are differentiated according to skill or geographical location in other contexts. Third, non market activities and leisure time are incorporated into the model with the recognition that women are more likely to perform household work while men are more active in the labour market and have more leisure time (<a href=\"#bib4\">Statistics South Africa, 2001a</a>). Thus, this accounting framework brings together market and non market activities using macro- and micro-economic datasets for South Africa. The SAM also incorporates 4000 households derived from the Income and Expenditure Survey and Labour Force Survey of 2000 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Statistics South Africa, 2001b</a>). The resulting SAM has household-level data on expenditure, income as well as the allocation of time to different activities.",

In particular, the elimination of import tariffs is likely to increase poverty more among women and children living in poverty than men.

The findings reveal a strong gender bias against women with a decrease in their labor market participation, while men participate more in the market economy. This strong result is due to the fact that female workers are concentrated in contracting sectors that were initially among the protected sectors and that benefit little from the fall in input prices. In contrast, male workers are more concentrated in the expanding export-intensive sectors. Female labor market participation drops particularly for black African women, as they are more concentrated in contracting sectors. As male labor market participation and real wages increase more than for their female counterparts, their income share increases within the household. Women continue to suffer nonetheless from a heavy time use burden given their increased domestic work with trade liberalization.",

In particular, two issues point to areas requiring immediate government attention. First, the simulations show that because of the many competing demands on women, they continue to suffer from a heavy time burden and it is therefore important to design complementary policies to reduce this time burden on women through measures that save time or improve the productivity of time use, such as women\u2019s access to education, land, credit, information, and technology. Second, the simulations show that government may offset revenue losses through an increase in indirect taxes. For the modeling community, the approach used in this paper was, to our knowledge, the first exercise of its kind in South Africa. Major innovations in the work are that unlike any previous CGE work in the country, the modelling incorporates explicitly non-market activities (household production and leisure activities). This integrated CGE microsimulation approach makes possible the assessment of between and within-group distribution, poverty and inequality following a trade liberalisation. Another advantage of the approach is that it enables explicitly working out how trade liberalisation influences household production and leisure.",
