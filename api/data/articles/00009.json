The principle computing characteristics include the degree of modularisation, parameterisation, generalisation and robustness. The paper describes the decisions taken with regard to type of dynamic model used. The LIAM framework has been used to create a number of different microsimulation models, including an Irish dynamic cohort model, a spatial dynamic microsimulation model for Ireland, an indirect tax and consumption model for EU15 as part of EUROMOD and a prototype EU dynamic population microsimulation model for 5 EU countries. Particular consideration is given to issues of parameterisation, alignment and computational efficiency.",

While most models have been built as stand-alone efforts, a number of attempts have been made to avoid the start-up costs and learning curve in building the model by utilising the same framework for alternative applications. There were some efforts in the 1970s to write generic microsimulation computer software packages. However because of the complexity of the systems to be simulated, users typically found that they had specialist requirements that these software packages could not cater for.

Not being funded by a major research grant or by a government institution LIAM falls into the latter \u201clow budget\u201d category, being developed initially as part of a PhD and latterly expanded with small research grants and with the assistance of a number of PhD students. As a result, it is freely acknowledged that current implementations of LIAM are relatively basic compared to the existing proprietary models listed above. But these shortcomings can be overcome, subject to improved data and funding availability. The advantages already offered by LIAM lie in its flexibility and modularity, and its objective of providing an unconstrained model development platform, adaptable to future uses and future proofed to allow for future enhancements.",

The individual is then passed through each ageing module in turn. The ageing modules to be used are specified as part of a parameter list, which allows the order and the types of the transition processes to be varied. Input parameters for each ageing module are stored in Microsoft EXCEL spreadsheets and are accessible via the user front end. Output from each ageing module is stored, in memory, in alignment storage matrices. For example, alignment regressions produce a deterministic component XB to which is added a stochastic component, \u03b5. These are stored in a dynamic data structure and ranked with the highest Z percent of values taken from the exogenous totals in the alignment process. If the ageing module is a transition between states, then the output will be a probability, otherwise if the ageing module is a transition between continuous amounts, for example incomes, the output is a real variable. When all individuals have been passed through the particular ageing module, alignment occurs (see section 5 below for a description). This ensures that aggregates from the micro model match macro aggregates. Finally if a variable for any individual changes then this change is registered in the database (i.e. in both the physical relational database, stored on the hard disk in ASCII and the virtual database stored in random access memory). In what follows the operations of each of these components of the ageing module are unpacked in more detail.",

Making data storage event driven, new data is stored only when a new event occurs and thus the data changes. Gender is therefore only stored at birth. One can make significant savings in memory as a result. Each individual variable, however, requires more information than is the case in a cross-sectional data structure.

Thus each individual could be read from the database, their life course simulated and then stored in the database one at a time. LIAM, however, uses a closed model. Except for new births or immigrants, no new individuals are generated. Marriages, for example, link individuals already in the database. This method is more straightforward to interpret as it mirrors what happens in the real world. As a result of this closed approach, individual behaviour can become dependent on the characteristics and behaviour of other members of the sample. For example, alignment to required global totals means that the chance of employment for an individual is not independent of the rest of the population, but depends upon the aggregate outcomes of the whole labour market. Other operations in the model that may depend on other individuals include the marriage market and other processes which depend on spousal information and alignment routines.",

To this end, therefore, during a model run the virtual database stored in memory during the operation of the program mimics the structure of the relational database stored on the hard disk. Once the data have been read from the database into memory, LIAM runs through each object type (person, family and so on), in turn simulating the life course events desired for each object of that type. Simulation processes are therefore object-type specific",

They may be initialised elsewhere and have other operations carried out in other parts of the program. As the modelling framework is so large and complicated, it rapidly becomes difficult to keep track of all the places in LIAM which need to be altered when a new variable is included. As a result, instead of declaring variables within LIAM, we declare the list of variables to be used separately in a parameter sheet (dyvardesc) .LIAM then creates space for the variable, initialises the data and carries out all necessary transformations and operations automatically. This minimises the number of model alterations necessary when a new variable is introduced, keeping the framework entirely flexible with regard to the set of variables used whilst maintaining its robustness. For example, if the user wishes to introduce a new instrument with an output variable such as health status, then the user simply needs to introduce the variable into the parameter sheet and LIAM will do the rest, without the user having to recode the framework itself. Another advantage of the flexible declaration of variables is that, because variables are stored in vectors, new composite variables can be produced easily. For example, a complex variable like disposable income, if not simulated directly, can be generated from the vector of its components such as employment income and capital income.",

The result is a set of independent components that do not interact with each other directly, allowing the framework to operate as a collection of independent building blocks. Because each process module is entirely self contained, each can be run independently, left out or replaced by an alternative module. Constructing a program in this way allows for the model to be easily expanded to deal with new behavioural equations or functions. Also, because it allows the user to focus on individual components one at a time, without interaction with the rest of the program, the robustness of the model can be improved.",

Similarly sociological analyses and long-term care analysis may depend upon wider kinship networks. These linkages are not strictly hierarchical (e.g. region, household, family, individual). The may, in fact, consist of a web of linkages (region, firm, household, family, individual, mother, father, partner, children and so on). This multi-level structure with its complex interactions between levels is one of the main complications of microsimulation models that make it difficult to use person-based modelling frameworks. While it is not infeasible to simulate using non-hierarchical linkages such as those between relatives across households using other software packages such as social simulation and statistical packages, the non-hierarchical structure often requires one to be \u201ccreative\u201d in designing the model due to inflexibilities in the model as they are often non-standard requirements.

Therefore calculation of the number of persons in a household is a process carried out at the household level. This new household level variable, npers, can be accessed by individual processes using the prefix h_npers. (The actual prefix used is user-defined.) In similar fashion linkages can be made between objects of the same type.

However it is also desirable that the new child inherits the linkages of the parent. So, for example, the partner (if any) of the mother at birth becomes the child\u2019s father.

One solution is to simulate the range of characteristics of new immigrants on arrival. However the range of characteristics is very broad and variable and so it would be very difficult to retain the correct multi-dimensional distribution of characteristics. To avoid this problem we sample (with replacement) from a set of immigrant households in the data. Thus whenever we need an immigrant household we simply select a \u201creal\u201d (data-dependent) family with the actual characteristics of a new immigrant family. In addition to preserving the multi-dimensional distribution, it saves substantial computing time compared to having to simulate all of the relevant immigrant characteristics.",

This feature exploits the modularisation inherent in LIAM, where because each process is seen as a separate building block, the number, type and order of processes can vary without having to change the programme code. Each process or module has a corresponding parameter sheet in the parameter file \u201cTransitions\u201d. These parameter files tell the model the output variables of each process, the type of process, whether a process needs to be aligned and the actual process parameters themselves, such as the transition rates, regression equation and policy rules and so on. If a particular process is to be aligned, then LIAM will look for an appropriate set of <i>alignment</i> parameters. Sometimes individual parameters may be required to be changed between runs without any change to the set of processes.

Transition Matrices are often used to perform these operations. They specify the probability of an individual with particular circumstances moving from state A to state B. In this framework, transition matrices can be stored as log-linear models (See, for example, <a href=\"#bib6\">Dobson, 1990</a>). In this way transition rates are decomposed into average and relative transition rates. As a result extra-relative transition rates can be added with ease. For example, if a mortality rate on average fell by 0.1% every 10 years, then a time-dependent relative probability parameter of 0.999 could be added. Similarly, this approach allows the model builder to combine information from different sources. So, for example, we combine actual age-gender specific mortality rates for 1991 taken from life-tables and use relative mortality rates taken from <a href=\"#bib13\">Nolan (1990)</a> that incorporate socio-economic relative mortality rates.",

In addition we employ the order of Decreasing Differences algorithm proposed by Howard Redway at the UK Department for Work and Pensions, which creates a measure of the distance of an individual from the centre of the population (or the average characteristic of the population) and first selects for matching the females with the most unusual characteristics, who are likely to be the most difficult to match.

For example, when using discrete choice models such as logit or probit models, the predictive power is often poor. Duncan and Weeks (<a href=\"#bib7\">2000</a>:292) highlight that \u201ceven in functionally well-specified models, the predictive performance is poor, particularly where some states are relatively densely or sparsely represented in the data\u201d. Greene (1997:894) attributes this to the fact that \u201cthe maximum likelihood estimator is not chosen to maximise a fitting criterion based on prediction of y, as it is in the classical regression (which maximises R<sup>2</sup>). It is chosen to maximise the joint density of the observed dependent variable.\u201d Thus the further the probability of an event occurring is from 0.5, the less effective these decision rules are at producing the desired result. As a result models may under or over predict the number of events. So, for example, if 5% of individuals of individuals should have the event, then the logit model may not necessarily produce 5% of events. Alignment, however, will constrain the event to occur to 5% of individuals. This is effectively a calibration mechanism and will produce the correct proportion of events. Of course, care must be in its use as alignment may lead to the disguising of errors in model specification.",

We wish to include occupation in the alignment as occupational structure is very important for other characteristics in the model, and because there are known to be significant differentials in occupational mortality rates. However if one of the core targets in the model is to achieve the mortality distribution supplied by external sources such as official population projections, which may be disaggregated only by age and gender, then our meso-alignment may produce different aggregates. This will happen if our underlying occupation distribution is different to the one implicit in the official forecasts. It may therefore be desirable to adjust the results again to achieve these targets. This process is known as macro alignment.

However one would have to shift earnings as well. unfortunately, due to rigidities in the labour market, this may not necessarily happen. Labour demand may be fixed, in which case we may just simply see that as more women supply labour, they simply replace people in the labour market who are less \u201cemployable\u201d. This is similar to not shifting alignment at all. In cases where there are market interactions such as this, it may be useful to incorporate a model of the market that would inform the response of alignment totals to economic and demographic totals.

To improve this we introduced a new category in the data dictionary which specified what type of variable to be used, so that binary variables only took up a fraction of the space required to store a <i>double</i>. Also we stored real and categorical numbers as integers. Real numbers were converted to integers by multiplying by 1000 and retaining only the integer element of the number.

However some processes, such as transformations and unaligned processes, do not need to be done serially. Efficiencies could be gained by simulating these processes in parallel. For example, if age is simulated for an individual, then age squared and age band could be calculated using age as input for each individual before continuing on to the next individual, cutting the number of data passes and improving the speed of the model.

The first component of the model is developed outside the framework, requiring the statistical matching of individual tabular local area census information with micro-level household data to produce the base dataset. This is done using a statistical matching algorithm. The LIAM framework is used to simulate typical dynamic microsimulation variables such as demographic and labour market variables.

This aids model flexibility, as code does not need to be reprogrammed when parameters change. This in turn improves the durability of models developed using LIAM, as it allows new parameters to be included when better information becomes available. This is perhaps the most important feature of the LIAM, allowing the framework to be used to develop model applications for a wide variety of purposes.

Similarly, because module run-order and type is parameterised, the model can handle any number of modules in any order without the need for extra programming, provided the functionality of the new module maps onto one of the existing generic module types. New modules can be added to a model without affecting its integrity as, in LIAM, all modules are designed to work independently of each other. This further adds to the robustness of the model.

We have also set out in detail the process required to align aggregate outcomes to the proportion or number of objects in, or moving between, given states, including consideration of hierarchical (meso/macro) alignment.",

The main improvement has been move from the evaluation of functions on a universal, periodic, basis, to an initial universal evaluation followed by reevaluation only for those objects to whom the function applies, and for whom values in relevant elements of their attribute set have changed. Secondary improvements have been linked to more efficient data storage, including the conversion of all data, including floating point data, to integer format.",

But unfortunately the methodological underpinnings of many models remain undocumented or are set out only in in\u00achouse documentation. In this paper we have attempted to publicly document some of the issues that have arisen in the creation of the LIAM framework, with the hope that other model builders can learn from our experiences. Although the framework is not an attempt at writing a microsimulation programming language, it has allowed for a variety of different applications to be constructed without the need for extensive recoding. In addition, as we have shown, it has been possible to use this framework as a template for other dynamic models, because the model itself is entirely independent of data and behavioural equations to be used. To promote collaboration and further development, LIAM is available to researchers on request.",
