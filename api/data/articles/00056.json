As an important part of the project, this article provides a brief overview of China\u2019s medical insurance reform of urban employees and detail the techniques and processes to construct a basefile in 2005 for projecting the medical expenditures for urban employees over the period of 2006\u20132010. The main data used are administrative medical records of medical insurance participants provided by the Bureau of Labour and Social Security of Kunming, Yunnan Province. Along with the initial analysis for the raw datasets and age processing and adjustment for the individual records, monthly income information was imputed and personal savings accounts were established for each individual record. Important modelling parameters such as death rates and income adjustment factors were constructed. Furthermore, this article identifies medical insurance for government officials by using the combination of logarithm curve fitting and binary discriminant analysis. Based on this basefile, a static microsimulation model can be built to assess the implementation effects of the medical insurance policy and analyse the impact of the medical insurance scheme on urban employees.",

Commencing in 1995, with Zhenjiang and Jiujiang as the two pilot cities, a new medical insurance system in China which covers all employers and employees in urban areas was established in December 1998. This medical insurance system covers all employers and employees in urban areas working in government organizations, enterprises, social groups and non-profit-making bodies (<a href=\"#bib13\">State Council 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Xu 2007</a>).",

In principle, the employer contributes about 8 per cent of the total wage bill, of which 30 per cent is credited to the employee\u2019s personal savings account and the balance paid into the social pool fund. An employee pays 2 per cent, which is fully credited to his or her personal savings account. Retirees are exempted from paying the premiums (<a href=\"#bib13\">State Council 2004</a>).",

Calculating the scheme entry age is needed for the purpose of calculating the premium allocation to the personal savings accounts by employers. The percentage of allocation may be different for individuals with different ages.

It was found that there were 231,189 persons who made a one time alteration, 95,308 persons had a second alteration, and 18,009 had a third alteration and so on. This sort of record detection terminated after 10 times of status alteration which left only 6 remaining records. Then by reversing the procedure 10 times, the scheme status of participants was decided due to their last status alteration. Eliminating the records of individuals who quit the scheme, a dataset having 790,186 individual records was obtained. This dataset did not contain the records of individuals who died in 2005.
