The model is simplified by using pre-estimated wage densities, relative to a full RURO model. EU-SILC data and EUROMOD are used to obtain the data for estimation, with an application to France, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, and the UK in 2015. Their finding that the optimal tax-transfer rule is close to a flat tax accompanied by a Universal Basic Income or \u2013equivalently\u2013 a negative income tax might depend on the specificities of the assumed analytical framework, but is illustrative of an innovative and potentially powerful use of behavioural tax-benefit microsimulation models.",

The findings show that the current tax systems result in a significant home ownership bias. In other words, even with the recurrent tax on property, there is still smaller average and marginal taxation of home ownership investment when compared to financial investments. The findings of this paper make an important contribution to the literature on the tax treatment of home ownership by providing evidence that the home ownership bias in the income tax system is not offset to any degree by recurrent property taxes. The exception is France, not surprisingly, because property taxes are relatively higher there than in the other seven European countries.\u201d",

The focus of the paper is on estimation of the economic burden for adults with the disease, their carer, and the government, in the Australian population.

As such, it is potentially an important application of microsimulation to model population prevalence, socio-economic characteristics, risk factors, impacts and interventions. <a href=\"#bib2\">Kopec et al. (2022)</a> present a microsimulation model of the Canadian population called SimYouLate used to model the impact of low back pain on disability \u2013measured as years of healthy life lost due to disability (YLDs)\u2013 and the impact on disability reduction of interventions to prevent the condition. These were weight loss, ergonomic interventions, and an exercise program. SimYouLate was developed using \u201cflexible, continuous-time microsimulation software\u201d designed for modellers with no programming background. The authors note that \u201cmicrosimulation offers greater flexibility in specifying the statistical models describing event rates and changes in variables over time, ability to model many events simultaneously while considering competing risks, and modeling the distributions of variables in the population.\u201d The model was based on the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) which provides a representative sample of the Canadian population. Intervention outcomes were modelled using published data on relevant interventions. The effects of the interventions were modelled from 2021 to 2040 using published data on relative risk (RR) for a range of population subgroups and intervention effects. In the base-case scenario, LBP was responsible for 424,900 YLDs in Canada in 2020 rising to 460,312 YLDs in 2040.",

Although the model does not estimate costs it does have the advantage of producing YLD estimates, commonly used within global burden disease estimates, which are highly influential in policy settings particularly in relation to national health priorities. Being limited to persons 20 years and over the model excludes the paediatric population. This is an important population that could be considered by this paper\u2019s authors or others in the future, perhaps with different interventions given the lack of relevance of occupational risk in childhood, one of the three areas of intervention in this study. In summary, this is an interesting application of microsimulation to assess YLDs associated with low back pain and the impact of interventions, bringing microsimulation to bear in the influential area of global burden of disease measurement. It is somewhat different to the small number of other studies applying microsimulation in relation to chronic pain which is most commonly used to assess cost effectiveness of interventions with a few studies examining workforce impacts and cost of illness.",
