During this conference many delegates expressed the need for a forum to provide a greater interchange of ideas and expertise. Following a period of gestation the International Microsimulation Association was formally launched in October 2005. A further two years later selected \u2018proceedings\u2019 of the conference appeared (<a href=\"#bib2\">Gupta &amp; Harding, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Harding &amp; Gupta, 2007</a>). These two volumes add to a relatively short roll-call of similar publications documenting earlier microsimulation-focussed conferences. Over the years these various sets of proceedings have provided the closest approximation that the microsimulation community has enjoyed to a regular peer-reviewed outlet for the reporting of the latest technical and methodological developments.",

In response the IMA has founded this peer-reviewed online journal, the aim of which is to foster the dissemination of these specialist technical developments, including examples of their validation or benchmarking, as well as examples of the good practice underpinning many microsimulation models.",

In summary, microsimulation (originally called microanalytic simulation) is a modelling technique that operates at the level of individual units such as persons, households, vehicles or firms. Within the model each unit is represented by a record containing a unique identifier and a set of associated attributes \u2013 e.g. a list of persons with known age, sex, marital and employment status; or a list of vehicles with known origins, destinations and operational characteristics. A set of rules (transition probabilities) are then applied to these units leading to simulated changes in state and behaviour. These rules may be deterministic (probability = 1), such as changes in tax liability resulting from changes in tax regulations, or stochastic (probability &lt; = 1), such as chance of dying, marrying, giving birth or moving within a given time period. In either case the result is an estimate of the outcomes of applying these rules, possibly over many time steps, including both total overall aggregate change and, crucially, the distributional nature of any change. Given the emphasis on changes in distribution, microsimulation models are often used to investigate the impacts on social equity of fiscal and demographic changes (and their interactions). Modelling of the distribution of traffic flows over a street network is another increasingly important use of the approach.",

In a pure MSM transition probabilities lack evolutionary and spatial dimensions. As microsimulation models add more behavioural and spatial interaction between individual units, as CAs add a growing range of individual attributes and start to incorporate aspatial behaviours, and as ABMs add both space and fiscal/demographic characteristics to their agents, the three approaches move towards a common ground.",
