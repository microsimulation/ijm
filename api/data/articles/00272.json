They propose an ingenious nowcasting method to quantify the impact of large, unprecedented macroeconomic shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic on living standards across the income distribution. The method is based on two key assumptions: (i) some workers are not at risk of losing income (e.g. \u201cessential\u201d workers), and (ii) a fraction <math alttext=\"\\alpha\" id=\"inf1\"><mi>\u03b1</mi></math> of those at risk loses a percentage <math alttext=\"\\beta\" id=\"inf2\"><mi>\u03b2</mi></math> of their income, with <math alttext=\"\\beta\" id=\"inf3\"><mi>\u03b2</mi></math> being homogeneous in the population: for instance, 90% of those at risk lose 20% of their income, or 60% of those at risk lose 40% of their income. Parameters <math alttext=\"\\alpha\" id=\"inf4\"><mi>\u03b1</mi></math> and <math alttext=\"\\beta\" id=\"inf5\"><mi>\u03b2</mi></math> are then selected in order to match macro-economic projections. This allows to nowcast incomes in a household survey, which then permits a quantification of the distributional impact of the shock, pre- and post-taxes and benefits.",

It finds that inequality would have increased further due to rapid population ageing, but increasing employment and policy changes almost completely offset this development. The paper offers a decomposition exercise \u00e0 la <a href=\"#bib1\">Bargain and Callan (2010)</a>, but using a double hurdle model instead of an unrestricted labour supply model to estimate behavioural responses. The decomposition distinguishes between a policy effect, a wage effect, an indirect policy effect, an indirect wage effect, a preference effect, a restriction effect (the first unemployment hurdle), a population effect, and income growth. The paper shows that employment growth due to the reduction in involuntary unemployment (the first hurdle) has been more important in slowing down the increase in inequality than changes in labour supply (the second hurdle).",
