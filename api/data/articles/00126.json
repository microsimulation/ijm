Poverty among children is particularly worrying, as it has long term (and often irreversible) effects on individuals. Furthermore, it can be transmitted from one generation to the next and significantly reduce economic growth. To address this issue requires fiscal and budgetary policies supporting health, education and improving the household economy. At the same time, the Burkina Faso\u2019s budget deficit has grown in recent years as a result of various crises, which have hit the country.",

The results indicate that increased public education spending helps raise school participation and promotion rates. This increases the supply and education level of skilled workers, leading to a reduced incidence and depth of both monetary and caloric poverty. A cash transfer scenario reduces child poverty even more.",

They identify three mechanisms to create fiscal space: establish priorities in public spending, increase foreign borrowing, or increase government revenues. In terms of uses of this space, they analyse an increase in spending on health, education and infrastructure. The authors show that there are trade-offs, for example between impacts on monetary poverty and health/education impacts, between the different spending scenarios. There are also trade-offs between financing mechanisms in terms of the reliance they create on domestic and foreign sources of financing. Investment in infrastructure is shown to not only beneficial for growth, but also for attainment of the MDGs. Health and education spending may run into structural constraints, notably the fact that learning and the training of personnel takes time.

In other words, there would be three percent fewer children living under the poverty line and five per cent fewer children suffering from caloric poverty.

Given that poor households have, on average, more children, this type of policy benefits them more than the other two policies.

Under the spending scenario, the greater demand for teachers pushes wages up, and has positive general equilibrium repercussions on the rest of the economy. Compared to the spending scenario, the school fees subsidy frees up a share of the household consumption budget for the purchase of other products, which explains why the results concerning poverty are better.",

The amount injected into the economy is the same in each of these three cases, making it easy to compare the three scenarios. In all scenarios, the injections are reduced gradually in order to attain the same deficit-to-GDP ratios as a reference \u2013 business-as-usual \u2013 scenario, but over a slightly longer period: ten years, instead of five. Compared to the reference scenario, the results indicate that higher public education spending increases school participation and promotion rates, leading to an increased supply of skilled workers and higher economic growth, while also reducing the incidence and depth of both monetary and caloric poverty. The school fees subsidies have more differentiated impacts on education, with a larger beneficial impact on primary school entry but a partially offsetting decline in education quality and resulting promotion rates. As a result, the supply of skilled workers and economic growth are practically unaffected. By freeing up part of the household budget for other ends, this type of intervention has a slightly stronger effect on poverty than public spending. Cash transfers have a minimal impact on educational behaviours, and thus on the supply of skilled workers and economic growth, but they directly increase household income thus significantly reducing the incidence and severity of poverty.",
