The conference was a great success, thanks to the efforts of Anna Wetterling and the Organising Committee. During the General Meeting, Ann Harding, Asghar Zaidi and Paul Willamson stepped down as president, vice-president of IMA, and editor of the International Journal of Microsimulation. The GM instated Cathal O\u2019Donoghue as president, Marcia Keegan as vice-president, and I as editor of the IJM.",

They have founded IMA and brought it through the first\u2013sometimes difficult- years. IMA now is well established, and the IJM has proven to be a competitive journal that offers papers and notes of high quality to all those working in the field of microsimulation. We will do our best to take up where they left off, and continue making the International Journal of Microsimulation the success it deserves to be.",

In the short term, I strive to link the journal\u2019s content to REPEC, and complete the first cycle of the review process of a typical paper within 6 months. Furthermore, I will actively look for papers, books to review and other possible input, in order to have a stable two issues per year. In the longer term I hope to increase the number of issues per year from two to three, among preferably not more than one special issue. Also, I wish to apply to link the journal to Econlit, JSTOR and other search engines. Ultimately, in the long run, the International Journal of Microsimulation must and will strive for an impact factor. All your help in this would obviously be very much appreciated.",

Three of these papers were previously accessible through the \u201cearly view\u201d page of the IJM. In his paper, Hovick Shahnazarian uses estimation techniques designed to ameliorate the undue impact of influential observations on forecasting corporate tax revenues. He applies these in a dynamic micro-econometric simulation model for firms, to show that a statutory corporate tax rate reduction may not reduce the effective corporate tax rate to an equal extent because firms adjust their behaviour to new tax rules.",

Virtual encounters within and across the borders of countries are simulated and the resulting dataset contains information about the degree of dissent between citizens with regard to various types of work-related values. By aggregation of these simulated value conflicts it becomes possible to anticipate future conflicts within and between groups of natives and immigrants.",

SM2 is not meant to be an alternative to general tax-benefit simulation models, but as a complementary tool which those models can usefully exploit.",

They address methodological difficulties and conclude that the survey database performs reasonably well in capturing the relevant characteristics of the resident population and allows analyses with respect to characteristics not found in the administrative database, and vice versa.",

This paper describes a newly extended version of the dynamic micro simulation model SADNAP, which is being developed for calculating the financial and economic implications of demographic ageing. The model has been extended in several aspects: a new micro data source with individual data on private pensions is combined with differentiation of mortality rates and the retirement decision is now based on an option value model. The paper discusses the extensions and their application.",
