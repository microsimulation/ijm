                "text": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, a large variance of incidence rates on local level, e.g. cities and districts, within one country have been observed, while the same non-pharmaceutical measures have been taken to control the spread of the virus. This variance in incidence rates triggered the question, if the spread of incidence rates can be explained only by statistical processes and the local population statistics or if indeed other factors, e.g. local information campaigns, have to be considered. Within this paper we study the expected spread of incidence rates in the German State of Rhineland Palatinate during the second COVID-19 wave using an agent based simulation. We find that our agent-based model is able to replicate the observed incidence rates per district by only considering state-wide policies. While this does not imply that local policies or specific local political circumstances have no impact on local infection rates, it suggests that the dominant factors driving the distribution of infection rates across a state are primarily statistical effects, demographics, and state-wide policies.",

These encompassed extensive lockdowns, movement restrictions, social distancing guidelines, quarantine procedures, mask mandates, and robust testing and contact tracing initiatives. Travel restrictions were enforced, while remote work and online education were promoted. Most measures have been taken at state- or national wide level, however, still a significant variance on the actual infection rates on local level, e.g. districts or cities has been observed. This triggered the assumption, mainly in media, that some kind of special local circumstances, e.g. the impact of local politics, testing- or information campaigns might cause this variance (<a href=\"#bib1\">STERN, 2021</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Zeitung, 2020</a>).",

We have chosen the state of Rhineland Palatinate as a testing environment for this hypothesis. Given that Rhineland Palatinate is a medium sized state within Germany with 4.1 million inhabitants, including larger cities and more rural areas, we would argue that the general conclusion should stay largely valid for the whole of Germany. It should be noted that legal restrictions in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic could only be issued on national or state-level, e.g. for the whole of Rhineland Palatinate. Local or regional measures within the state of Rhineland Palatinate where only on recommendation basis without any legal implications.",

In contrast, agent-based models simulate individual agents with specific characteristics and behaviours, providing a more intricate representation of interactions and spatial dynamics (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bullock, 2021</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Pillai et al., 2023</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Vyklyuk et al., 2021</a>).

The underlying problem is the large dimensionality of the input space, and the significant required computing time to predict one output distribution for a given set of input parameters. History matching is a (pre)calibration technique that has proven successful with complex deterministic models and can identify the subset of the input space that could give rise to acceptable matches between model output and measured data. It relies on a Bayes Linear approach, meaning simplifying the underlying model and thus being able to identify potentially interesting regions in phase space, which have to be considered further in the full simulation, yielding a significant improvement in computing time. To facilitate this process, we utilised the in-development R package hmer (<a href=\"#bib12\">Iskauskas et al., 2022</a>), designed to streamline emulator construction and the generation of representative parameter sets for subsequent iterations of emulation and history matching. This package has been employed successfully for parameter estimation in other epidemiological scenarios. The emulation and history matching framework presents several advantages over traditional parameter estimation methods, with a notable benefit being the requirement of relatively few evaluations from the computationally expensive simulator to train an emulator. Following the optimisation of model parameters using data up to December 14, 2021, we projected the entire second wave until February 22, 2022.",

This ratio increases significantly for the 5-14 age group. While a general trend toward unreported cases is anticipated, the extent of the observed underreporting appears surprising.

Exemplary we discuss, the overall hospitalisation rate for the last 7 days across all age groups, when no policies would have been applied, as well as when no school closing policies are enforced. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, the total number hospitalisations over the simulation period increases drastically in comparison to the observed value, when no policies are applied. In fact, nearly all inhabitants get infected in this scenario. When repeating the fits to data, without assuming any school closing measures, we find an increase by a factor of 2.5\u00b10.05 on the incidence rate. The smallest observed increase was a factor of 2.4, the largest observed increase a factor of 2.7 among 30 studied scenarios. The increase on the hospitalisation rate and death rate is consistent, yielding factors of 2.6\u00b10.2 and 2.6\u00b10.1. Further details are discussed in <a href=\"#bib13\">Heger et al. (2023)</a>.

The resulting distribution of infected agents for each simulation at each time-step is gaussian and the 1 <math id=\"inf2\"><mi>\u03c3</mi></math> interval is taken as statistical uncertainty. The systematic uncertainties are due to uncertainties on modelling parameters after the fitting procedure to data.

To answer this question, it is important to note that the uncertainties in the reported infection numbers, as well as the limited number of districts studied in our simulation, do not allow for a definitive conclusion regarding the impact of local policies. To test a potential local effect, one could examine, for example, the outcome of a simulation in which only two-thirds of agents aged 5\u201314 in the district of Mainz adhere to the state-level school closure policy, while the remaining agents in this age group continue to meet in larger groups. This scenario results in a higher infection rate for the district of Mainz compared to the standard simulation setup. However, it would still be compatible with the observed spread across all districts within the 95%confidence level. Thus, local policies might still have an influence, however, the expected spread of infection rates due to statistical effects and population demographics is so large that many local measures are likely to be obscured by state-level trends and purely statistical factors.",

The simulation was tuned on the overall number of confirmed COVID-19 death cases during October 2020 and mid of December 2021, however, no specific tuning on district level has been performed. We observe a good description of the spread of incidences per 10k inhabitants in all 36 districts and cities of Rhineland Palatinate. We observe a correlation coefficient of 0.5 between the simulated and measured incidences per 10k inhabitants. No specific local measures, such as dedicated informationcampaigns, special testing or tracing campaigns have been implemented in the simulation. Nevertheless, the observed incidence rates per district can be described by the simulation. This suggests that the incidence rates per district are primarily driven by statistical effects, population statistics and state-wide regulations.",
