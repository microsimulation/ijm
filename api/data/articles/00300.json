                "text": "While innovation supply is creative, unpredictable, and not necessarily related to future economic usefulness, resource provision is focused on economic returns, experience based and narrower, implying a positive economic risk of not understanding innovative commercial winners. We demonstrate through simulation experiments on an economy wide firm-based model that industrial growth is explained by industrially competent identification and financial support of winners that are carried on to industrial scale production and distribution. The simulations capture the dynamic economic systems effects on the entire economy, from micro responses to macro and the feedback on micro behaviour of expectational mistakes. <i>Competence bloc theory</i> is used to model the supply of innovations and their commercialization in what we call an <i>Experimentally Organized Economy</i>. We demonstrate that lack of commercialization competence, notably industrial competence embodied in venture capitalists\u00b4 ability to identify, select and finance radically new innovations breaks the conventionally assumed linearity between innovation supply and economic growth. We also demonstrate the existence of long-term and possibly very large losses in output from the loss of winners during the commercial filtering of the competence bloc, and that the economy wide costs incurred by protecting losers may be large.",

A stochastic spread in innovative output is assumed, and innovative output is fed into a standard production function as a shift factor, relating innovation to output or growth in a linear fashion. This linear relation between R&amp;D investment and growth has strong a priori policy implications. Since R&amp;D finance can be provided by government as a controlled policy measure the model predicts a direct positive influence on growth. This story has its origin in <a href=\"#bib7\">Arrow (1962)</a> and has been reinforced in numerous so called neo-<a href=\"#bib82\">Schumpeter (1942)</a> based innovation systems models. We think this is a policy argument more based on prior assumption than on empirical evidence and will demonstrate why. If you add price taking and profit maximizing behaviour these <a href=\"#bib82\">Schumpeter (1942)</a> engineering models can be made identical to a standard neoclassical or \"new growth\" theory model. As a rule, both approaches are aggregate, or based on the Marshallian notion of representative firms.",

We model innovation supply and the demand for innovations, or the commercialization process separately, and create a <i>market for innovations</i> in between, in which innovations are identified, selected, and financed (see <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1B</a>). To capture the role of this innovation and discovery process in economic growth an economy wide model is used that (1) features learning and innovation supply on the one hand, and on the other (2) a realistic modelling of both the commercialization of innovations, or innovation demand, and (3) the market selections that occur when supplies and demands are confronted in the markets for innovation. During that market process (4) business mistakes are constantly made. We regard these business mistakes as a normal <i>transactions cost</i> for economic development (<a href=\"#bib52\">Eliasson and Eliasson, 2005</a>). To do that, and to be able to assess the dynamic efficiency of the consequent allocation process 1 through 4 in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1B</a> we introduce <i>competence bloc theory</i> (<a href=\"#bib51\">Eliasson and Eliasson, 1996</a>). The main point argued is that innovation is creative and unpredictable, while the selection of innovative output is based on experience. In the markets for innovation therefore a wide diversity of innovative supplies is confronted with a more narrow competence to discover and successfully select winning projects (\u201cwinners\u201d) for commercialization. The logical consequence of that fact will be an unavoidable flow of economic mistakes. Some losers will always be kept on the budget for too long (Mistake Type I), and some winners (Mistakes Type II) will constantly be lost (<a href=\"#bib51\">Eliasson and Eliasson, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Eliasson, 2005a</a>). This selection is dynamically efficient when the total costs of the two types of mistakes are minimized. Since the minimization is driven by market competition the role of markets in economy wide behaviour becomes central for our story, and competence bloc theory explains how. This selection, or commercialization process breaks the linearity of the neoclassical and standard Schumpeterian models. It should also be obvious that the flow of business mistakes should not be modelled as a stochastic process, which is common practice in neoclassical growth models, all of which lacking explicit markets. Let us call our distinctively different growth model evolutionary or Austrian/ early <a href=\"#bib81\">Schumpeter (1911)</a>.",

Competence bloc theory is part of the theory of the <i>Experimentally Organized Economy</i> (EOE) and lists the pricipal actors engaged in the selection and commercialization of new technologies such that the economic incidence of the two types of business mistakes is minimized i.e., of keeping losers on the budget for too long, and of losing the winners (<a href=\"#bib39\">Eliasson, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Eliasson, 2005a</a>) . Competence bloc theory is therefore instrumental in defining the dynamic efficiency of commercialization and scale up of innovations, or the <i>receiver competence</i> of the local market. Competence blocs take form, often spontaneously, either within hiearchies or in markets, or as hybrids. Market selection and commercialization commonly mean the comittment of economic mistakes, mostly in the form of below expected outcomes, but also as outright failure and exit from the market. At the economy wide level those economic mistakes will be interpreted (in the EOE) as a <i>normal transactions cost</i> of economc development (<a href=\"#bib52\">Eliasson and Eliasson, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Eliasson, 2005a</a>). Since systematic economic mistakes are not recognized in neoclassical equilibrium modeling, except sometimes as random departures from static equilibrium, we here have one well defined departure from neoclassical orthodoxy. <a href=\"#bib69\">von Hayek (1935)</a> and <a href=\"#bib22\">Dahm\u00e8n (1942)</a> both discussed them in the form of systematic investment mistakes (\"Fehlinvestitionen\"). <a href=\"#bib81\">Schumpeter (1911)</a> and <a href=\"#bib82\">Schumpeter (1942)</a>, however, did not recognize the feedback influence of economic mistakes on the behavior of market agents that we refer to as a Stockholm School example of ex ante-ex post analysis, and central to both the theory of the experimentally organized economy (EOE), and the micro firm based model approximation of the EOE, called MOSES, that we use in this study. As already mentioned, <i>business mistakes for us become a normal market phenomenon</i> that originates in <i>the pervasive ignorance of \"boundedly rational\" agents about circumstances that may now and then threaten their very existence.</i><sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> Such systemic economic mistakes, representing fundamental economics in the theory of the EOE, and the micro macro model MOSES, both affect agents' attitudes to uncertainty and are a source of learning from experience. The latter, we repeat, distinguishes MOSES economics from neoclassical equilibrium economics, which is only compatible with random and costless departures from equilibrium, insurable risks that contain no information to learn from. This implies that the dynamic efficiency of the selection and commercialization process cannot be defined in the neoclassical equilibrium model, since you cannot demonstrate the \"market based minimization\" of the economy wide costs of type I and type II economic mistakes under <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1A</a>. The feed back from business mistakes to the formation of new business decisions and plans, and later realized behaviour are explicit in the micro-to-macro model we use both to define the <i>receiver competence</i> of the local economy (<a href=\"#bib34\">Eliasson, 1990</a>) to identify,capture and take new technologies on to industrial scale production, and to quantify the role of commercialization competence in economic growth in terms of competence bloc theory in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1B</a>. This unique model feature represents an early Austrian influence on economic theory that was introduced by Wicksell and developed further into so called Stockholm School economics (<a href=\"#bib37\">Eliasson, 1992</a>).",

With our technological definition of innovations in competence bloc theory (see <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1B</a>), we cannot call the identification and selection of economic winners in the supply flow of new technological combinations an act of innovation. It is an act of commercialization, for instance entrepreneurship (under Item 3 in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1B</a>). Commercialization competence depends on how this selection is organized. Competence bloc theory covers, as one extreme case, the complete internalization of an entire commercialization sequence within one firm hierarchy. The other extreme is an entirely decentralized market selection with all agents in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1B</a> operating independently in markets. Apparently the competence bloc therefore embodies a Coasian type theory of the firm, the limits of which are determined where administrative coordination beats the market in coming up with new products and technologies (<a href=\"#bib20\">Coase, 1937</a>). A fully decentralized competence bloc coordinates the tacit competences of individual agents through asset markets. <i>The efficient transfer of innovation assets across the competence bloc, therefore, requires the existence of well-defined property rights, and in the case of a completely decentralized market based competence bloc, very sophisticated asset markets are required</i> (<a href=\"#bib62\">Eliasson and Wihlborg, 2003</a>).",

Simulations on the MOSES model demonstrate that for a long time several paradigms may be represented simultaneously in manufacturing markets. Such lock-ins into inferior paradigms may also block the development of a better paradigm (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ballot and Taymaz, 1998</a>).",

Radically new technology tends to be introduced more frequently into production through new firm entry than in incumbent firms. When it occurs through new investment in incumbent firms the impact is reduced because it must be integrated in old vintages of capital. On the other hand, the new technology, if successfully introduced in an incumbent large firm applies to a much larger capital base, with a larger (than with the small firm) leverage on total firm productivity growth. One could look at the introduction of new technology in a MOSES firm (and scale up through investment) as a strategic acquisition of a new technology firm the capital structure of which is then integrated with the existing capital structure (see <a href=\"#bib32\">Eliasson, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Eliasson and Eliasson, 2005</a>).",

Increased innovative entry (1) gave no, or small growth effects if the requisite reallocation of resources, notably of workers did not occur. On the other hand (2), if reallocation of resources and structural change was too fast, such that market price setting became disorderly, the rate of mistaken business decisions escalated, and eventually the expected growth effect failed to occur, but this time for an entirely different reason. Even without any technical change or innovative entry, an early result from MOSES analysis (3) has been that if a positive market induced allocation of resources, again notably workers, can be engineered short term productivity growth improvements would follow, but again only up to the limit where the governance of market pricing is disturbed (<a href=\"#bib27\">Eliasson, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Eliasson, 1987</a>). In short, up to a limit innovative entry raises the rate of growth but this positive outcome is tempered by the capacity of factor markets to reallocate resources flexibly, the labour market being of particular importance. An optimum growth promoting firm turnover rate exists that depends on the capacity of factor markets to reallocate resources flexibly. (An increase in innovative entry gives only a small growth response at the economy wide level if resources are not freed from their current allocations through the exit of inferior firms and workers flexibly transferred to expanding producers). Common to all experiments is that the <i>effects of small parameter changes are slow in showing up at the macro level, but with time sometimes tend to cumulate</i>. This is also a typical property of selection based, initial state dependent non linear models. In agent based models with these properties we find in addition that the balancing of all these factors depends on a complex of cirumstances, some of which being policy parameters, that must be right for \"optimal\" receiver competence and macro performance. Not only is that very difficult and competence demanding of policy makers. Policies can also, and easily turn destructive when they interfere left-handedly with the internal selection dynamics of economies. Since the gestation period of the macroeconomic effects is so long, when discovered, it may be too late to correct policy mistakes. And for obvious reasons, the policy maker who caused the mistakes should not be expected to know how to correct the consequences of his mistakes. The damage to the economy may even be permanent. Thus, evidence is not in favour of policy fine tuning. Rational policy makers should rather opt for making factor market more flexible and support a broadening of the experience base of the competence blocs of their economies.",

This assumption and the consequent absence of a unique equilibrium, set the theory of the EOE and the MOSES model apart from the mainstream neoclassical model. In a recent presentation of the paper at a seminar at MERIT in Maastricht (May 2006) it was argued that you do not have to assume a large opportunities space the size and complexity of which is constantly maintained through simultaneous exploration, learning and discovery (innovation). Forgetting is sufficient to prevent the economy from converging onto a unique equilibrium point. True. Depending upon what you forget convergence can go anywhere. But this only does away with exogenous equilibrium. To have a positive sum game and endogenous growth you need explorative learning and the S\u00e4rimner effect, i.e., a <i>constantly maintained</i>, very large, complex, and non-transparent opportunities space that grows from being explored.",

Estimated parameters from the <a href=\"#bib73\">Klevmarken and Dahlman (1971)</a> linear expenditure system have been directly introduced into the MOSES model. The expenditure system receives all incomes generated in the production firms, net of the Swedish taxes, as detailed in <a href=\"#bib28\">Eliasson (1980)</a>, and are then fed back from quarter to quarter to final goods markets as demand. Onto this expenditure system of MOSES two novel nonlinear features have been affixed; (1) a separate savings category called <i>future consumption</i>, and (2) a temporary investment category making it possible for households to save extra or accelerate purchases of investment goods depending upon expected inflation and the real interest rate. As has become custom in neoclassical macro analysis this expenditure system can be assumed to be based on an aggregate of representative atomic households that at at each point in time, are assumed, as in the <a href=\"#bib77\">Modigliani and Brumberg (1955)</a> model, to maximize their lifetime consumption (<a href=\"#bib24\">Eliasson, 1976b</a>) . The household sector has been prepared for a micro household module. Hence, the household was to be modelled as a rational commercial actor and a sophisticated wealth manager of an extended family aimed at leaving positive monetary wealth at the expected death of current family members, partly for the rational reason that current family members might live longer than expected, and therefore should not starve during their final years, but also because of extended family preferences (<a href=\"#bib29\">Eliasson, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Eliasson, 1985</a>). Even though the micro household model has yet to be readied, a compatible data base for several years of the 1980s has been collected (<a href=\"#bib54\">Eliasson and Klevmarken, 1981</a>).",

This is of course an oversimplification as soon as you reach below the aggregate level. At that level \u201claboratories\u201d are specialized to produce technical combinations related to the type of commercial activity of the firm. Furthermore, and contrary to the implicit assumption of Arrow (1962), there are efficiency characteristics of the innovation function related to the ways research is organized and the scale of the activity. There is evidence suggesting that small scale is more congenial to turning out winners per dollar invested than is research organized in the laboratories of large firms or universities. Large firms may, however, be better at commercializing new innovations once they have understood them. They also have the resources to rapidly carry winners, once they have been understood to be winners, on to industrial scale production and distribution (Eliasson and Eliasson, 2005). While competence bloc theory defines actors by function, in reality both innovation, entrepreneurship and venture financing may be conducted within the same firm entity. Commercial considerations may therefore enter already at the innovation stage, and bias innovation supplies in a more profitable direction.",
