Exploiting microsimulation tools we quantify the extent to which government measures supporting households\u2019 incomes and lessening energy price hikes mitigated the distributional impact of the inflationary shock. We show that, if evaluated on the basis of both their cost for the public finances and their impact on inequality, the interventions explicitly targeted towards the less well-off households were the most effective, while the untargeted reductions of energy and fuel prices were the least effective.",

The increase in prices was partially mitigated by a number of Government measures, some addressed to all consumers, and others targeted to less well-off families and individuals. This paper analyses the effect of the sharp rise in prices on the purchasing power of different types of Italian households and quantifies the impact of the Government measures.",

To different degrees all such contributions point to a larger negative impact of inflation on purchasing power for poorer households. A partial exception is <a href=\"#bib7\">Cardoso et al. (2022)</a>, that makes use of data on individual financial wealth and finds that the redistribution from lenders to borrowers induced by inflation and its impact on sticky sources of income are significantly larger than the effects of the relative consumption channel. <a href=\"#bib5\">Bella (2022)</a> identifies the household types who benefited the most from Government intervention up to the summer 2022; his results are consistent with ours. <a href=\"#bib18\">Ufficio Parlamentare di Bilancio (2022)</a> employs microsimulation models and finds that up to September 2022 the Government measures in Italy were able to cushion almost half of the average loss in purchasing power by households; differently from us, they do not assess the redistributive effects of the inflationary shock for different income levels. <a href=\"#bib9\">Colabella et al. (2023)</a> study the effects of the energy price shock on financial vulnerability of the Italian households taking into account the price elasticity of consumption patterns: they conclude that households\u2019 behavioural responses to price changes helped in containing the effects of inflation on financial vulnerability, at the expenses of consumption reduction and the ensuing welfare loss.",

Periods of high inflation determine strong redistribution patterns among different categories of consumers. Individuals spending a higher fraction of their income on items whose prices increase more suffer a higher welfare loss. This is confirmed in <a href=\"#bib17\">Prati (2023)</a>, who uses survey data on French households to find that own-specific perceived inflation rates, which track well the actual inflation rate for each individual, help predict well-being differences among consumers. Moreover, even for constant consumption basket composition, the inflationary shock (measured with respect to disposable income) hits more hardly those with a higher average propensity to consume out of their income. Finally, there are also other mechanisms operating in periods of a high inflation that lead to pronounced redistributive movements, chiefly involving wealth.",

To do this, we exploit BIMic, the tax and benefit microsimulation model of Banca d\u2019Italia that matches survey consumption data with survey income and wealth data (<a href=\"#bib12\">Curci and Savegnago, 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Curci et al., 2020</a>) to estimate the impact of the inflationary shock on the distribution of households\u2019 purchasing powers (the realized scenario). In addition, as we want to evaluate the extent to which the redistributive effects of inflation have been mitigated by the Government policies, microsimulation techniques help us define two counterfactual scenarios: one in which anti-inflation policies are muted but changes in prices caused by the shock are operational (i.e. the no-Government intervention scenario) and one in which even the inflationary shock is excluded (i.e. the pre-shock scenario). The difference in 2022 expenditure levels between the no-Government intervention scenario and the pre-shock scenario measures the gross impact of the inflationary shock; the difference between the realized scenario and the pre-shock scenario measures the impact of the inflationary shock fully accounting for the anti-inflationary measures. Finally, the difference between the no-Government intervention scenario and the realized scenario proxies the effect of the policy measures over the purchasing power distribution.",

The reduction is particularly high for the first three deciles (i.e. households with an ISEE below approximately 11,700 euros). These families absorb almost all of the resources allocated to the strengthening of energy bonuses: being concentrated on a relatively small number of households, these resources are therefore effectively used to attenuate the energy shock where this affects the most. It should be emphasized that \u2013 despite the concentration of the energy bonus among the poorest families \u2013 households with ISEE above the median still receive about 46 per cent of the total resources devoted by the Government to cushion households from the energy shock. This reflects the fact that the most affluent households, characterized by higher spending volumes, benefit the most from the measures that affect the prices of energy goods and that recipients of several measures are identified on the basis of individual income, with the relevant exception of the social bonuses.",

Government interventions are able to sterilize about 70 per cent of this greater inequality. However, the four main Government interventions are not equally effective in achieving this goal. The social bonuses on utilities prove to be the most effective measure in alleviating the worsening of inequality, since they are designed on the basis of ISEE; their enhancement significantly reduces the Gini index, absorbing much less resources than the other measures. The one-off allowances (bonuses by 200 and 150 euros), the other measures affecting take-home pay (reduction in social security contributions and partial advance of pension indexation) and, above all, the non-selective interventions on the prices of energy goods (reduction of general system charges and of VAT rate on gas, cut of excise duties on fuels) are much less effective in reducing inequality, especially if assessed in terms of their impact on public finances.",

The indexation is full for retirees with pension income up to approximately 2,100 euros per month and gradually smaller for higher-income retirees as their pension rises. The partial anticipation enacted in the last months of 2022 only applies to retirees with annual pension income lower than 35,000 euros. As noted for the cut of the rate of social security contributions (see footnote 3), even the revaluation of the pensions increases taxable income and we fully account for this in the model.",

The D.L. 130/2021 extended to the fourth quarter of 2021 the reduction in general system charges for electricity users and extended it to gas users; for these consumers it also dictated the application of a reduced value added tax (VAT) rate (at 5 per cent). This implied a smaller increase than there would have been without the Government intervention for both electricity tariffs (29.8 percent instead of 45 per cent) and gas tariffs (14.4 per cent instead of 30) in the corresponding regulated markets. The same decree also strengthened the standard electricity and gas social bonuses, intended for the most economic fragile families, by raising their amount (see below).",

As a consequence, in the regulated markets in the first quarter the increase in electricity tariffs was attenuated by about 10 percentage points, to 55 per cent, and that of gas tariffs by 17.5 points, to 41.8 per cent. The D.L. 21/2022 also allowed, starting from the second quarter, the modification of a tariff component that effectively implied the repeal of the general system charges payed by gas users. Overall, such measures implied a reduction in electricity and gas bills (estimated at around 10 per cent), the first after almost a year and a half of continued increases. The Budget law also envisaged a cut (by 0.8 percentage points) of the rate of social security contributions paid by employees whose annual wage was below 35,000 euros.<a href=\"#fn6\"><sup>6</sup></a>",

The number of households eligible for social bonuses was also temporarily expanded.<a href=\"#fn7\"><sup>7</sup></a> Such bonuses, although implying a direct discount on the energy bills, until March 2022 were not considered by Istat in the compilation of the harmonized price index (being instead accounted for as public transfers in the disposable income of households). Since April 2022, Istat considered the discount on the bill as an effective reduction of the price, with a significant impact on headline inflation. This decision was motivated by two reasons: first, the introduction of an automatic procedure for granting the bonus (it is the social security institute, INPS, that communicates the names of the eligible families to the various electricity and gas suppliers which then directly apply the discount on the bill); second, the availability, from April on, of precise estimates on the number of beneficiaries (about 3 million households for the electricity bonus and 2 million for the gas bonus). As a result, the increase in energy prices was revised downward to 40.0 per cent year-on-year, from 42.8 in the preliminary estimate; the growth of the general index was corrected downwards to 6.3 per cent (from 6.6).",
