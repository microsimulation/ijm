We need to specify the mechanisms through which such networks are built and how innovation takes place in them and in the economy generally. This analysis is carried out in the context of a micro-based macroeconomic simulation model (MOSES). Technological change is viewed as taking place at the micro (firm) level. Firms vary in their choice of technology and in the degree to which they make successful use of a given technology. This is a result of their having different abilities to learn, to imitate others, and to generate new technology on their own. We refer to that ability as their <i>receiver competence</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eliasson, 1990</a>). The channels through which spillovers diffuse through the economy are listed in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>. Together they make up a global market for technology diffusion or spillovers. Firms form networks to increase both their connectivity and their effectiveness in exploiting the stock of knowledge and experience, i.e., to increase their receiver competence. In studying the economy-wide effects of spillovers and technology diffusion attention must be paid to all five channels of diffusion in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>.",

The primary focus of the model is on the individual firms of manufacturing industry, and how they interact and compete in markets to create economy wide change. This industry is therefore modeled in greater detail than other sectors: a government sector, a household sector, and a foreign trade sector. There are also sectors for agriculture/forestry/fishing, construction, oil, electricity, services, and finance, although these are not explicitly modeled at the micro level. Together the numbers initially (the year simulations are started) add up to the level of Sweden's National Accounts (NA). Through the simulations stock flow and micro to macro consistent national accounts are generated by quarter for a Sweden like the industrial economy in <a href=\"#bib8\">Eliasson (1976)</a>.",

Hence, the population of firms, and production structures are also endogenous). Together, the synthetic firms in each industry make up the difference between real firms and the industry totals in the national accounts. There are approximately 150 real decision-making units covering about 30 % of manufacturing employment and output, and about 75 synthetic units at the beginning of the simulation.<a href=\"#fn1\"><sup>1</sup></a> This number tends to increase during simulations because new entrants often out number exits.",

The basic inputs to this planning process are (1) the firm\u2019s initial position (level of employment, inventories, etc.), (2) a specification of the feasible production/employment combinations (determined by past investments), i.e., the firm\u2019s production function, and (3) a set of ex ante profit target satisfying production/employment combinations.",

In the case of labor, the adjustment takes place in a stylized labor market, where firms\u2019 employment plans confront those of other firms as well as labor supply. The labor supply is treated as homogeneous, i.e., labor is recruited from a common \"pool\", but can also be recruited from other firms. However, the productivity of workers depends on where they are employed. This process determines the wage level, which is thus endogenous in the model. In a similar manner, firms\u2019 production plans are revised after each market confrontation in the domestic product market, and domestic prices are set.<a href=\"#fn2\"><sup>2</sup></a>",

What drives the model are new entrants spurred by expected profits, feedback mechanisms (particularly in labor and product markets) and innovations among incumbents provoked by their fear of being overtaken by competition (<a href=\"#bib14\">Eliasson, 1995</a>).

Then the probability that the Mth technology will be imitated depends positively on the number of firms using PTM, the index number of PTM, and the distance between PTM and the firm\u2019s current technology. Finally, the techniques of the new technology are selected randomly, since an imitator does not know all the techniques of the imitated firm (there is no patent licensing in the present version). The same trial procedure as for radical innovations takes place.",

Average GNP growth rates in the first group of simulations range from 3.3 to 3.5 percent per year, compared with only 0.7 to 3.3 percent in the second group. Among them only LOWRECEIPT comes close to the long run growth outcomes of the first group of simulation experiments, and the reason for that outlier in the second group is interesting (see below).",

That a more restrictive network reduced the market based diffusion of technologies was no surprise, but there was no way of anticipating the magnitudes of this macroeconomic outcomes purely from understanding the principles of the model.

The only simulation in the second group which comes close to the GNP and manufacturing growth rates in the first group is the LOWRECEPT case. Even though it underperforms the reference on all counts it is way ahead of the other group 2 simulations in growth and especially the NORECEPT simulation. The bad performance takes its time to show at the macro level, and it hits hard and fast only in the NORECEPT experiment. Apparently a dynamic cumulation build up of consequences is involved. Firms enjoy a reasonable return to capital and invest and the slow learning and relative lack of general knowledge and special skills begin to bite only towards the end of the fifty-year simulation, however much faster in the NORECEPT experiment. The economy apparently passes a non linear triggering point as you lower the receptivity, parameter further going from the LORECEPT to the NORECEPT situation.",

The rate of return and the learning rate are low. Investing on its own in R&D it however completely outperforms the LOWCONNECT experiment, which exhibits a disastrous long run growth outcome. Firms in that experiment fail to learn as much as in the NOCONNECT experiment, and fail as well, despite a high and increasing rate of return to capital (compared to the NOCONNECT experiment) to invest in R&D, general knowledge, skills and production equipment.

Comparing the first group of simulations NETRANDOM, NETGENHK, NETINTER, and NETLINK), there are no major differences in the overall economic growth rates. The average GNP and manufacturing growth rates for the whole 50-year simulation range from 3.3 to 3.6 and from 3.6 to 4.3 percent per annum, respectively. The rates of return in manufacturing are generally high, ranging between 7 and 10 percent on average over the whole fifty year period period. The main differences that occur are about the magnitude and timing of investment in capital and R&amp;D, which, in turn, lead to differences in labor productivity growth rates and in the cumulative build-up of both general and specific skills. Also, something apparently goes wrong in the NETINTER case in the last ten years of the simulation, causing a collapse in labor productivity growth, a sharp reduction in the GNP and manufacturing growth rates, and a much more modest increase in investment than in most of the other cases. While in the first four decades the NETINTER case shows the highest rates of accumulation of R&amp;D and skills the firms still fail to turn that advantage into growth. Investment drops sharply in the last two decades, as does manufacturing productivity and output growth in the final decade. These are familiar (from earlier analyses, e.g. <a href=\"#bib10\">Eliasson, 1985</a>) \u201cmacro discontinuities\u201d that are caused because many firms, during an earlier strong expansion phase with strong networking effects, have been locked into the same technology.

It also has the highest learning rate and labor productivity growth rate. In fact, the slightly better growth outcome of the NETLINK market organization has been significantly more costly in terms of investments in R&D and the development of general knowledge and special skills, while investment in physical capital has dropped radically. Hence, the rate of return on that capital has increased. By implication, the Silicon Valley type clustering of technologically (very) advanced firms in this experiment, while not increasing the output cake more than slightly compared to the reference case, has raised the share of resources being devoted to human capital, and (but less so) the share going to the owners of physical capital. Apparently the clustering of mutually supportive human capital intensive firms has caused a rasdical shift in income generation towards those firms and forced the exit of low performing firms, causing by implication (noty shown) also more uneven income and wealth disteributions.",

The learning and spillover effects are impressive in the NETINTER case until the collapse in the last decade of the simulation.

The LOWRECEPT case shows steadily increasing stocks of general knowledge, special skills, and R&D, as well as a fairly high learning rate - just not as high rates of growth as in the first group. Thus, reduced spillovers yield generally worse performance. But the results get much worse when the connectivity within the network is reduced (the LOWCONNECT case); the stocks of knowledge and R&D fall. Firms reduce their investment, and both GNP and manufacturing output eventually fall as well. A comparison between the LOWRECEPT and NORECEPT cases shows that even a reduced intensity of spillovers is better than none: the stocks of knowledge and R&D do not fall until the last half of the simulation in the NORECEPT case. In the NOCONNECT case, firms are unable to imitate each other\u2019s innovations even though they are still able to reap benefits from spillovers. They invest more than they do in any of the other simulations and achieve steady, albeit not impressive, economic growth - at the expense, however, of low rates of return.

It does not seem to matter much who the other network members are; the important thing is that the right design of market networks expand the range of options available to each participant and increases the knowledge and experience base upon which decisions can be made.
