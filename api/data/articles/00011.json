                "text": "This paper overviews recent work that has attempted to bring together microsimulation, Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) and macro models to perform distributional analysis in developing and transition countries. Particular attention is paid to applications relating to aspects of economic growth and political economy. Applications in which macro, CGE and microsimulation models are either layered or integrated are considered. It is demonstrated that different combinations of such models, including those where only a single model-type is used, are appropriate for different problems. For short-run impact analysis, microsimulation on its own may be appropriate. For longer-run analyses, where interest is in the interrelationship between changes in disposable income, consumption and labour supply, these models need to be supplemented a combination of microsimulation on the one hand, and general equilibrium price changes or changes in macro variables on the other hand. In the case of national subregions, or countries embedded in free-trade areas, it is argued that microsimulation may adequately be combined with pure macro models. That is, CGE modelling may not be necessary. For distinct national economies, however, the first step beyond microsimulation should likely be integration with CGE modelling. Whilst much promising work has been undertaken on dynamic integrated CGE microsimulation work in developing countries, CGE work is most advanced for Less Developed Countries. At present several groups of development researchers are found to be putting these two approaches together, and in some cases are adding macroeconomic and financial modelling as well. In contrast, with a few conspicuous exceptions, little such work is being done for the transition economies.",

This is an area of great current interest. (See, for example, <a href=\"#bib4\">Ag\u00e9nor <i>et al</i>., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Cockburn, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Cogneau &amp; Robilliard, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Bourguignon &amp; Savard, 2008</a>.) While microsimulation is essential in modelling the distributive effects of taxes and transfers, it is limited by the fact that it is often non-behavioural and by its inability to model prices, wages and macro variables. CGE and macro models, on the other hand, have in the past generally lacked the rich distributional detail found in microsimulation. The solution that is increasingly being advocated is to combine these different forms of modelling, either through \u2018layering\u2019 the models, or through their integration.",

For example, in some cases there may be little reason to expect complex distributional impacts and standard CGE modelling, with its representative household groups, may be enough. Conversely, if interest centres on distributional impacts and there is reason to believe that general equilibrium price effects will be unimportant, then conventional microsimulation may be sufficient. But there are cases where combining the approaches is necessary to get an accurate picture. A prototypical case is that of removing agricultural protection in developing countries. Tariff removal leads to lower food prices, benefitting poor consumers. on the other hand, lower agricultural prices reduce the wages of agricultural labourers, many of whom are also poor. The result is that some of the poor will benefit and others will lose. CGE is needed to capture the wage and price effects, and microsimulation is needed to net out gains and losses for individual households, allowing accurate distributional analysis to be performed.",

In the transition economies similar issues are also important, but there are features that give some of these countries important aspects in common with higher income countries. Russia and the East European transition countries, although still poor relative to the West, are highly urbanized and industrialized. The portion of the economy in the informal sector is also relatively small compared with many developing countries. These aspects mean that food price and agricultural issues, for example, are less important than in many developing countries. Also, the tax, benefit and pension issues that face members of a formal-sector industrial workforce are more important. Conventional microsimulation has been developed to analyze policy issues and distributional impacts in highly urbanized and industrialized societies, and may therefore be more applicable and relevant in these transition countries than in many developed countries (DCs).",

No single household survey comes close to providing the required data. The best available household survey will be used as the \u2018host\u2019, but even the best surveys will not cover all the necessary variables, and the estimates they provide will be affected by reporting errors and differential response problems. This means that corrections need to be made to the data in the host survey, and that the host needs to be augmented by imputing values of omitted variables from other surveys or from administrative (for example social security or revenue authority) data.

For realism, it is likely best to base one\u2019s equations on econometric estimation using micro data. There is then a choice between the popular reduced form approach, and the more challenging and problematic structural approach. The latter requires making assumptions about the functional form of preferences and specifying constraints facing households and individuals carefully, in a world where these steps may be arbitrary and difficult.

Models with rigorous micro underpinnings and in some cases rich detail on heterogeneous consumers and firms have been generated. In the 1970s and 1980s, macroeconomists at Minnesota and other \u2018freshwater\u2019 North American economics departments began to develop dynamic general equilibrium models of the economy. These were initially quite controversial since they modelled unemployment as an equilibrium phenomenon, assumed rational expectations, and neglected the monetary side of the economy. However, as the models became more sophisticated they began to be more widely accepted. Today, a growing group of young researchers are working with dynamic GE models with heterogenous consumers and workers whose characteristics they specify by reference to microdata. (See for example the pioneering contributions of <a href=\"#bib42\">Huggett, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Krusell &amp; Smith, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Quadrini, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Ventura, 1999</a>.) In addition to savings, these models have endogenized labour supply and human capital investments. The researchers not only examine simulated distributions of earnings, consumption, and income, but have also shown interest in the distributions of wealth generated. Experiments have been done to replace progressive income taxes with consumption taxes, or with proportional income taxes. Studies of the impact of altering pension regimes have also been performed.",

The solution advocated, for example, by De Janvry <i>et al</i>., is to choose groupings carefully, in the light of one\u2019s political analysis.

A possible downside is that the tool could be \u2018hijacked\u2019 for political purposes. While the economist may wish to focus attention on state-of-the-art inequality and poverty measures, for example, there may be pressures from policy-makers and governments to focus on redistribution between key groups of voters instead.

In the <a href=\"#bib19\">Cockurn (2006)</a> study of Nepal, for example, one sees that a projected gain from trade liberalisation for a majority that includes most urban dwellers and higher income rural residents, suggesting that such liberalisation is politically feasible. Or in the work of <a href=\"#bib60\">Rutherford <i>et al</i>.

It would seem that a reasonable guess can be made about which of these policies would \u2018fly\u2019 with voters. It would be naive, of course, to think that the existence of majorities modelled to gain from particular policies means that the latter will necessarily be adopted, even in fully democratic countries.

We have seen that different combinations of such models, including those where only a single model-type is used, are appropriate for different problems. For short-run impact analysis, microsimulation on its own may be appropriate. However, we naturally want to know about the interrelationship between the changes in disposable income, consumption and labour supply found in a sophisticated microsimulation on the one hand, and general equilibrium price changes or changes in macro variables on the other hand. In the case of national subregions, or countries embedded in free-trade areas, it can be argued that microsimulation may adequately be combined with pure macro models. That is, CGE modelling may not be necessary. For distinct national economies, however, the first step beyond microsimulation should likely be integration with CGE modelling. Ultimately, structures in which macro, CGE and microsimulation models are either layered or integrated can also be pursued.",

Further, avoiding microsimulation by assuming that income distribution follows an assumed functional form within household categories in CGE exercises produces significantly different results from full CGE microsimulation. Taking such shortcuts has been shown to minimize estimated poverty and inequality impacts in some important cases. Also, the impacts of growth shocks, trade liberalisation and other shocks on distribution are shown to be much more complex in exercises that add full microsimulation to CGE and macro modelling. such insights as the <a href=\"#bib19\">Cockburn (2006)</a> finding that trade liberalisation will tend to reduce poverty for the urban poor in Nepal, while increasing it for the rural poor but especially the moderately poor in that group, are not to be found in more aggregated models.",
