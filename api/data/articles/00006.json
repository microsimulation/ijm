The reason for these omissions is data constraint: general nationally representative household surveys do not include most of this information, or the number of observations is too small for simulation purposes. The general wisdom holds: no model can be better than the underlying dataset.",

All models were meant to analyse the redistributive effects of taxes and benefits, in other words, seeking answer to the \u201cWho gains and who loses?\u201d question related to particular reform measures. The Czech, Estonian, Polish, and Slovenian model have also been used to analyse the incentive effects, for example by means of the calculation of Net Replacement Rates (for transition from unemployment to employment). The constructors of these models also believe that the main purpose of their models is to analyse the interaction of all the specific policy instruments. A rather interesting case is that of Estonia, where the model is used to prepare a future tax reform by providing evidence on the effect of environmental taxes on inequality, incorporating spatial analysis.",

Only the Estonian and Slovenian models received financial support from national research funds, and even in these cases only a share of the total costs were covered. Uncertainty surrounds the future updating and development of all of the models described in this note, primarily due to the insecurity of future funding. The main reasons for this insecurity, according to the national model constructors, are a lack of awareness of the benefits that microsimulation techniques offer for informing government policy decisions, lack of coherent priorities in government and scientific funding, changes in government personnel, a lesser political focus on evidence-based policy making, including ex-ante and ex-post impact assessment of policy changes, and the fact that all scientific funding is short term, meaning that continuity is necessarily uncertain. As a result (nearly) all of the Eastern European microsimulation models are funded as short-term research projects and constructed by researchers external to government, in contrast to Western Europe where nearly all governments fund at least one (or more) model on a long-term basis, run by ministries or statistical agencies in-house.",

Indeed, this is the key question facing all of the models in the region: the need to increase the use and policy impact of this novel policy instrument. Currently the number of individual users per model is estimated to be between 2 and 5, and even the most optimistic estimates do not go higher than 10. Therefore, a key task of the model constructors to overcome the barriers to use. For this, national microsimulation constructors aim to prepare a use-friendly interface, provide training to users, give lectures on policy results, and publish the results of the analysis.",

This is regarded as being a preparatory step of doing the same for all of the ten of the new member States.
