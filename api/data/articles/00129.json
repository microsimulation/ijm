We use a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model linked to a microsimulation model based on the latest household income and expenditure survey, in a top-down approach. All public investments are assumed to increase total factor productivity through increased supply of skilled labor and/or irrigated land. We find that investing in farmer training alone has great potential to increase growth, food security and poverty reduction, given that the economy is labor-intensive. Investing in training combined with irrigation has even greater impacts. An irrigation only approach will not yield the expected results if agricultural labor does not have the required skills. The irrigated agriculture sector has great potential despite its small size. However, for the impact to be notable, important investments are required in the first place to increase the share of irrigated agriculture versus the rain-fed. An agriculture-led development is less likely to occur because: i) of weak forward and backward production linkages between agriculture and manufacturing sectors; ii) a significant share of manufacturing inputs is imported; iii) the resulting contraction in private investment which restrains expansion of the manufacturing and services sectors",

Moreover, the sector is the economy\u2019s largest employer. A significant proportion (72.6%) of the labor force works in agriculture and related activities. Agriculture also provides the largest source of exports (over 75%), and thus foreign currency inflows, which enable the country to import vital raw materials and inputs, including those essential for agricultural production. Finally, agriculture plays a central role in the production and provision of food. Thus, this sector can strongly contribute to poverty alleviation, as a considerable share of income is spent on food (52%).",

Productivity gains are to a large extent due to the expansion in cultivated areas and favorable climate with a minimal role for improved technology. Cultivated area, production and productivity have been increasing, but at a decreasing rate (NBE, 2013\u201314). Peak periods in production and productivity are driven by good climate conditions. Agriculture is mainly rain-fed. Although greater emphasis is being given to irrigation and farmer training in recent years, the share of irrigated area and skilled workers remains small. Only about 9% of arable land was developed under small scale irrigation schemes in 2010\u201311 (GTP APR 2012\u201313); i.e. 1,064,200 ha out of a total cultivated area of 11,822,786 ha (Agricultural Sample Survey 2010\u201311). The share of skilled agricultural labor remains only 17.3%. Vulnerability to climate variability translates into significant fluctuations in agriculture annual GDP growth rates. From as high as 13.5% in 2004\u20132005, growth rates have subsequently become lower and more varied: 6.2% in 2008\u201309, 7.6% in 2009\u201310, 8.9% in 2010\u201311, 4.9% in 2011\u201312, and 7.1% in 2012\u201313.",

The results of their paper show that agricultural growth contributes more to overall growth than non-agricultural growth. It also leads to greater poverty reduction by generating proportionately more income for farm households who represent the bulk of the poor. Decomposition of these effects also reveals that consumption linkages are much stronger than production linkages. Early work in India during the Green Revolution indicated that higher-income small farmers spent about half of their incremental farm income on non-farm goods and services as well as another third on perishable agricultural commodities. Thus, consumption linkages from growing farm income can induce sizable indirect effects on rural growth via increased consumer demand for non-agricultural goods and services as well as perishable, high-value farm commodities. On the other hand, the results also clearly show that exclusive focus on agriculture (or insufficient attention to non-agriculture) is counter-productive. Non-agricultural sectors have to grow in order to match the growing supply of agricultural products and increasing demand for non-agricultural products. Otherwise, falling relative prices of agricultural products may dampen the realized gains in growth and poverty reduction.",

Thus, Ethiopia\u2019s concentration of small-scale farmers presents less capacity to adopt new technologies. Finally, <a href=\"#bib8\">Dercon and Zeitlin (2009)</a> noted that with modest consumption linkages agricultural innovation is not sufficient to drive growth in industry. They find that it may not be necessary for Ethiopian agriculture to be oriented toward the supply of raw materials for industry, nor for all industrial energies to focus on the processing of domestic raw materials.

Households are distinguished by income (lower and higher income) and by location (rural, semi urban and urban) in the CGE model.

Changes in representative households\u2019 real consumption in the CGE model are then passed down to their corresponding households in the survey. In the next step, real total consumption expenditures are recalculated in the survey. Household size is used to calculate per capita consumption expenditure. Similarly to the representative households in the CGE model, the households in the survey are heterogeneous in their consumption patterns. The micro-simulation model calculates the share of each commodity in total expenditure for each of the survey households. These weights are maintained when post-shock consumption expenditure is calculated. This new level of per capita expenditure is compared to the exogenously given poverty line, and standard poverty measures are recalculated. The Foster Greer and Thorbecke (FGT) poverty measures are applied. The 3781 Birr per year and per adult poverty line used in this study is the official poverty line.

If total agricultural output divided by total labor force increases, this means that there are more goods produced per individual. This is a first indication of the potential for such a policy intervention to increase food availability. However, as our labor force is fixed within a given period of time, the food availability indicator will only reflect changes in the volume of output. To verify whether this type of policy intervention has further potential to contribute to reducing food availability, it is important to look at the changes across time in the food availability index to check whether it allows a more accelerated increase (relative to the first period) in food availability compared to the Business As Usual (BAU) reference scenario. The results may show that the policy has a potential for reducing food insecurity. However, this applies only if consumer prices of food crops remain unchanged or decrease. We upgrade our food availability index (<i>FAindexl</i>) by integrating the consumer price index (<a href=\"#equ6\">Equation 7</a>).",

Agricultural labor and land have been disaggregated using data from the 2010\u201311 Agriculture Sample Survey. Agricultural labor was disaggregated between skilled and unskilled labor. To disaggregate land between irrigated and non-irrigated land types, the same survey was used. Data show that a very small share of agricultural land is irrigated, although the potential for increases is high. There are six aggregate household groups: rural, small urban and big urban, each disaggregated into lower-income and higher-income categories. The SAM has three tax accounts (direct and indirect taxes and import duty), as well as aggregate accounts for trade margins, government, investment and stock variations, and the rest of the world.

Likewise, the share of skilled agricultural labor is low, reaching 17.3% in 2010\u201311. Overall when irrigated land and skilled agricultural labor are combined to form what we qualify as \u2018irrigated\u2019 agriculture, its share in total real GDP in the SAM is very small (4.6%) while its share in total agricultural GDP is 10.3%. Because of its small size, the 11.8% increase in skilled agricultural labor increases the share of skilled farmers to 19.3% of total agricultural workers, thereby increasing the share of irrigated agriculture sectors to 12% of agricultural real GDP and 5.4% of total real GDP. Similarly, the 10.5% increase in irrigated land increases the share of irrigated land to 9.7% of total land, thus increasing the share of irrigated agriculture to 10.7% of agricultural GDP (4.8% of total GDP).
