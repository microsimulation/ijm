There are also models of the macro economy created and used in both the public and private sectors and other models that focus on selected industries and regions. Finally, while this paper mainly focuses on analyses of the federal tax system, a significant portion of fiscal activity in the United States takes place at the state and local government level. Most states also impose individual income taxes and some of the larger states (including California and New York, among others) maintain their own microsimulation models for analyses of their state income taxes. Most states, however, do not have the capacity to develop their own modeling based on micro data from tax returns and rely on less detailed methods to project receipts and estimate the effects of changes in tax laws.",

The increase in GDP for the first three years after enactment of the 2017 Act that most models estimated was due to the increase in consumption and investment demand from lower average tax rates. (The exception is the Tax Foundation, which uses a purely supply-side modeling approach). Overall, five different groups estimated a short-term increase in GDP ranging from 0.4 percent to 0.9 percent of GDP (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gale et al., 2018</a>).",

Analysts use these models to generate forecasts of baseline receipts and deficits and estimates of the effects on receipts of proposed tax bills. These latter estimates constrain the legislative process, as Members of Congress frequently adjust tax legislative proposals to stay within budgetary limits. Microsimulation models also generate results that influence debates on tax and benefit legislation. These include models that estimate effects of legislative proposals on the level of economic activity, the after-tax distribution of income among income groups, and a variety of other outcomes that concern government officials, the media, and the broader public. Other microsimulation models estimate the effects of public retirement programs and transfer programs that benefit low-income households.",

The Act effectively removed the President\u2019s ability to impound funds, but in its place established procedures through which Congress could enact its own budget resolution to set targets for fiscal policies.

Since 1974, political control of both houses of Congress and the Executive Branch has often changed between the parties, but frequently different parties have controlled the different branches.

For these types of proposals, it is not feasible to estimate the numbers of taxpayers with net tax increases or decreases.",

These came from two sources. First, some of the tax changes were changes in refundable credits. The refundable amounts of these credits, defined as the amount of tax credits greater than taxpayers\u2019 positive income tax liabilities, are scored as spending in the federal budget. Second, the elimination of the tax on individuals who fail to contribute to health insurance was estimated to reduce purchases of group health insurance plans established under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. While the elimination of the tax would reduce receipts, it would also reduce participation in federally subsidized plans under the Affordable Care Act. The Joint Tax Committee and the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the reduced spending on these subsidies would exceed the reduced revenue from eliminating the mandatory tax on individuals not covered by qualified health insurance plans.",
