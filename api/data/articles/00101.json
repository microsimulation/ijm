                "text": "Policymakers in Australia, like in most OECD countries, have recognised the importance of early retirement due to ill health on individuals and families, as well as on the budget balance when planning for the health needs of an ageing population. In order to understand these effects, a unique microsimulation model, called Health&WealthMOD2030, was built to estimate the impacts of early retirement due to ill health on labour force participation, personal and household income, economic hardship (poverty), and government taxation revenue, spending and GDP in the years 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030. This paper describes the construction of Health&WealthMOD2030. The model captures the long term projections of demographic change, changing labour force participation patterns, real wages growth and trends in major illnesses affecting the older working age population. The base population of Health&WealthMOD2030 are the individuals aged 45\u201364 years with information on their work force status and health from the Australian Bureau of Statistics\u2019 Surveys of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC) 2003 and 2009. Projected estimates of income, taxation, income support payments, savings and superannuation from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM\u2019s) dynamic microsimulation model Australian Population and Policy Simulation Model (APPSIM) were synthetically matched with the base population. Health&WealthMOD2030 project forward the economic impacts of early retirement from ill health to 2030. This will fill substantial gaps in the current Australian evidence of health conditions that will keep older working age Australians out of the labour market over the longterm.",

Individuals are affected through reduced income and savings resulting from early retirement; governments through reduced income taxation revenue, increased expenditure on health care, and increased income support payments. The Treasury\u2019s Intergenerational Reports (IGRs) 2002, 2007 and 2010, and the Productivity Commission\u2019s report on the Economic Impacts of Ageing 2005, have emphasised that demographic ageing and labour shortages are the main pressures threatening the sustainability of the Australian Budget (<a href=\"#bib16\">Commonwealth of Australia, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Productivity Commission, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Commonwealth of Australia, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Commonwealth of Australia, 2010</a>). In response to these challenges, the Australian Government has promoted policies for deferred or gradual retirement in order to help maintain its revenue. However, with 50% of men and 20% of women in Australia retiring early from full-time employment because of their ill health, prevention and treatment of long-term health conditions are crucial to helping people remain in the workforce longer (<a href=\"#bib4\">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1998</a>).",

This is surprising given that several studies have demonstrated that indirect costs for a number of conditions are higher than the direct costs to the health system (<a href=\"#bib13\">Begley <i>et al</i>., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Taylor <i>et al</i>., 2006</a>). Although not specifically focusing on indirect costs, a few \u2018economics of illness\u2019 studies have included the indirect costs of premature retirement due to illness. One recent study, which mainly focused on estimating the health care costs of arthritis, also estimated some of the financial impacts of this condition on individuals and the New Zealand Government (<a href=\"#bib1\">Access Economics, 2005</a>). Similar studies have been published for visual impairment, cardiovascular disease, macular degeneration, and diabetes in Australia (<a href=\"#bib15\">Colagiuri <i>et al</i>.</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Access Economics, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Access Economics, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Taylor <i>et al</i>., 2006</a>).

They have tended to focus on a single disease and contain only limited economic data e.g. excluding superannuation and asset accumulation in their assessments of the broader impacts of ill health on wealth. They have also used simplistic methods of estimation, which seems to stem from their reliance on aggregated data. For example, estimates of lost income due to illness have typically assumed that all persons included in the study would, without illness, have achieved average earnings (<a href=\"#bib30\">Schofield &amp; Beard, 2005</a>). Such a generalisation does not take into account the evidence that both income and type of illness differ by age, sex, education and occupation. For example, a university degree is related to 100% higher earnings in later working life, compared to earnings for people without this level of education (<a href=\"#bib21\">Johnson &amp; Lloyd, 2000</a>). Another limitation is that they do not provide any distributional information on the extent of incapacity. It is therefore difficult to estimate, from these studies, the probability of an effective intervention leading to greater labour force participation. It is precisely this type of information, however, that needs to be used in up-to-date microsimulation models of health, income, government income taxation and support payments, and wealth, in order to guide effective government policy.",

It is estimated that there are currently approximately 650,000 Australians aged 45\u201364 years who are lost from the workforce because of their ill health, resulting in a loss of $12-$14 billion in GDP per annum (<a href=\"#bib33\">Schofield <i>et al</i>., 2008</a>). Our previous analysis indicates that those who are out of the workforce due to illness receive a weekly income that is less than one quarter of those in full time employment. The Australian Government also loses about $300 per week in taxation per premature retiree, and pays an additional $150 per week in government income support payments such as disability support payment, on average (<a href=\"#bib34\">Schofield <i>et al</i>., 2011</a>).",

The modelling also includes the probabilities of death, childbirth and overseas migration, allowing the simulated population to change and age over time.

Changes in the demographic structure of the population (such as ageing, labour force participation, disability and illness), from 2003 and 2009 to 2010 (and other modelled years to 2030) were captured through static ageing techniques. Both SDACs 2003 and 2009 were weighted by the ABS to address the problem of unequal probability of individual selection in the surveys, and to make the survey data a true representation of the Australian population in the survey year (<a href=\"#bib5\">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2010</a>). A survey weight designed to take into account the individual\u2019s probability of selection and the clustering and the stratification of the sample was assigned to each record in the dataset. This weight reflects the number of people with similar characteristics in the Australian population at the particular survey year. Starting with these sample weights, we then further reweighted the SDAC 2003 and 2009 to reflect the profile of the subsample aged 45\u201364 years in 2010 and other modelled years (2015, 2020, 2025, 2030) using a generalised regression reweighting algorithm programmed in a SAS macro called GREGWT.",

This is not important where there are no records in either dataset (77.4%) but is important if there are records in SDAC cells but no record in the corresponding APPSIM cells (4%). To overcome this problem, we used less than ten matching variables for some cells to avoid having no matching records, thereby allowing matching with the records from a neighbouring cell. To determine which matching variables would be used, we grouped the ten matching variables into two groups (<a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a>), and the distinct cells were first created on the basis of the five matching variables in Group A instead of the full set. The remaining five matching variables in Group B were ranked for each cell based on how much variation in income could be explained by each Group B matching variable as measured by the R<sup>2</sup> of a linear regression model from the APPSIM data. The ranking of Group B matching variables may be different for different cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). For example, for the unit records in Cell 2, which has the following characteristics: employed full time; married couple with dependents; 2nd income quintile; no age pension; no disability support pension, the next matching variable to group the unit records was \u201chome ownership\u201d. However, for the unit records in Cell 4, which had the same characteristics except for \u201c4th income quintile\u201d instead of \u201c2nd income quintile\u201d, the next matching variable to group the unit records was \u201csex\u201d. Once the unit records were grouped into new cells, the remaining matching variables were further ranked for each newly created cell based on how much variation in income could be explained by each remaining matching variable as measured by the R<sup>2</sup> of a linear regression model from the records in that cell and the unit records in each cell were further grouped into new cells based on the variable that explained the highest variation in income. The process continues until either all five Group B matching variables were used (i.e. cells are based on all ten matching variables) or there were no more than ten records left in the cell of APPSIM. Thus for some cells, not all ten variables were used.",

Health&WealthMOD2030 will be used to estimate (i) the number of people out of the labour force due to their ill health; (ii) the lost income and savings of people who have left the labour force because of their ill health, compared to those who continued in paid employment; and (iii) the extent of these losses due to: demographic, disease, or economic trends at 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030. Health&WealthMOD2030 will also be used to estimate the potential long-term economic gains from health interventions that address particular health conditions (such as mental health disorders), and risk factors such as obesity and physical inactivity.",

In absence of a dataset containing such detailed information on both chronic conditions and individual economic circumstances, we sourced our base population from the SDAC datasets (containing information on chronic conditions and limited economic data) and have linked the records with the APPSIM population (which contains detailed economic information). It is not possible to exactly match individuals between the SDAC and APPSIM for a number of reasons. Firstly, there was no unique identifier to link the two datasets. Furthermore, the SDAC is based on random survey data and APPSIM is a one percent sample of the census population. Although both are nationally representative samples, there will be a very few, if any, respondents in common on both data sources. Further, the data were collected at different points in time. While the SDAC data were collected in 2003 and 2009, APPSIM data were simulated events on 2001 data for the future years meaning that even for the few individuals that may be in common, some variables will no longer be the same between the SDAC and APPSIM. Finally, within Australia, exact matching between ABS surveys is prohibited. As a result of these constraints, we linked SDAC records with APPSIM records using synthetic matching based on ten synthetic matching variables. Synthetic matching was used to match individuals from the SDAC dataset to individuals with similar characteristics on the APPSIM dataset and create a synthetic population, which is a nationally representative sample of the whole Australian population. The method is commonly used in microsimulation models to create synthetic datasets (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hynes <i>et al</i>., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">von Randow <i>et al</i>., 2012)</a>.",

We have limited this mismatch by identifying the closest matching APPSIM unit record for each SDAC unit record using a standardized Euclidean Distance method based on the ten matching variables. Health&WealthMOD2030 has 99% of SDAC unit records matched with APPSIM unit records of the same categories for eight or more matching variables, with more than 90% matched for each of the ten matching variables.",

This process also allows some APPSIM unit records to be completely dropped from Health&WealthMOD2030 if there is no SDAC unit record that is synthetically matched with them. This means that there are inherent differences in the distribution of the information in APPSIM and Health&WealthMOD2030, and as a result there is the potential for the distributions of economic variables in Health&WealthMOD2030 to be different from the original distributions in APPSIM (i.e. benchmark distributions). For example, there is a 0.05% difference in average annual benefits received between APPSIM and Health&WealthMOD2030.",

Whilst the Government recognises that not all older workers are able to participate in the labour force for as long as they would like (due to their own ill health and informal caregiving to family members who are disabled or ill for example) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Moore <i>et al</i>., 1997</a>), there is little information available on the type of health conditions that are likely to keep people out of the labour force over the long-term.
