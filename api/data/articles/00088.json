In this article we argue that this situation is both undesirable and unnecessary. Provided the parameters used in the microsimulation are exogenous, as is often the case in static microsimulation of the first-order effects of policy changes, simple statistical tests can be sufficient. Moreover, standard routines have been developed which enable applied researchers to calculate the sampling variance of microsimulation results, while taking the sample design into account, even of relatively complex statistics such as relative poverty, inequality measures and indicators of polarization, with relative ease and a limited time investment. We stress that when comparing simulated and baseline variables, as well as when comparing two simulated variables, it is crucial to take account of the covariance between those variables. Due to this covariance, the mean difference between the variables can generally (though not always) be estimated with much greater precision than the means of the separate variables.",

No doubt, the fact that standard errors and significance tests are routinely reported by the software packages most commonly used for this kind of empirical analysis (e.g. SAS, Stata, SPSS) plays an important role here. Also in the field of income distribution and poverty, where until recently many scientific publications ignored sampling variation, reporting standard errors and tests of statistical significance is becoming more and more common.",

There may be a number of reasons for this situation, as discussed below. The purpose of this article is to argue that this lack of attention to statistical inference is both unnecessary and undesirable. It is structured as follows. After a discussion of the background to the current situation, we argue that straightforward statistical tests are often sufficient to assess the statistical significance of the results of specific but common types of microsimulation. Even for less straightforward situations, software is available to calculate standard errors and significance tests with little effort. We illustrate these points with results from a recent microsimulation of family benefits in Lithuania using EUROMOD, and finish with some concluding remarks regarding statistical inference in the case of more complex microsimulation studies. We stress that in this paper we are not breaking new ground in either microsimulation models or statistical inference. Rather, it is a plea to microsimulation practitioners to use the statistical tools that are at hand, in order to enhance the quality of their work.",

There may be uncertainty around the structure of the model (e.g., which parameters to include, the mathematical specification of the model), around the values of the model parameters, and more generally around methodological and substantive choices such as the time horizon and the measure of the outcome of interest. See <a href=\"#bib7\">Bilcke <i>et al</i>. (2011)</a> for an overview of sources of uncertainty and a checklist. Sampling variability is only one of many sources of uncertainty. However, in the specific but common case of static microsimulation of the first-order impact of a reform, using a tax-benefit model without behavioural effects and sample data about actual individuals or households, sampling variability is arguably an important, if not the main source of uncertainty. The parameters in such a model are derived from official tax and benefit regulations, so there is little uncertainty around those.",

This notion is mistaken, because the measured effect of the simulation will depend on who is selected into the sample.",

Other authors look at statistical inference of microsimulation results where revenue-neutrality is imposed (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pudney &amp; Sutherland, 1994</a>) or in the case of models involving uprating to future years, behavioural relations and dynamic microsimulation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Klevmarken, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Creedy <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>). In addition, microsimulation models often make use of complex sample data. Until fairly recently, most analysts carried out significance tests with the implicit assumption of simple random sampling. Statisticians have always insisted that it is important to take account of the sampling design when testing the statistical significance of results (e.g. <a href=\"#bib22\">Kish, 1965</a>; for a recent discussion see <a href=\"#bib18\">Heeringa <i>et al</i>., 2010</a>) and recent papers have shown that this is also the case for poverty and income distribution studies (e.g. <a href=\"#bib19\">Howes &amp; Lanjouw, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Biewen &amp; Jenkins, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Goedem\u00e9, 2013</a>). These studies may have created the impression that testing the significance of microsimulation results requires substantial effort from analysts, either because the analytical derivation of the sampling variance is rather complex (e.g. Pudney and Sutherland) or because bootstrapping or some other kind of time-consuming replication-based technique has to be employed (e.g. <a href=\"#bib9\">Creedy <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>). However, many simulation results are simple linear functions of sample data (e.g. differences in means, sums or proportions). Calculating standard errors for those results requires only the common techniques of survey analysis and is easily done with standard software. Furthermore, over the past ten years some software packages have been developed that make it much easier for applied researchers to perform statistical tests of changes in poverty and inequality measures, while taking the sample design into account (see especially <a href=\"#bib2\">Araar &amp; Duclos, 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2009</a>).",

In two papers no tests of statistical inference were performed at all, while in the third paper, the covariance between the baseline and reform scenario indicators was not taken into account. Sometimes the main substantive conclusions of the studies quoted below are based on microsimulation results for which the question of statistical significance is especially acute, when sample sizes are small and/or observed changes in poverty indicators are minor. The studies mentioned are diverse in terms of country coverage, policy reforms, household surveys and microsimulation model used. One of these studies (<a href=\"#bib11\">Davies &amp; Favreault, 2004</a>) used uprating to future years, which might complicate the calculations of correct standard errors. We come back to this issue in the section on limitations and further work.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup>",

No statistical tests are reported which would make it possible to evaluate which of these results, if any, are significantly different from one another. <a href=\"#bib27\">Notten and Gassmann (2008)</a> use the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) from 2000 to 2004 to analyse the impact of the Russian child allowance reforms and to simulate the effects of various means-tested and universal child benefit schemes. This study performs ad-hoc simulations, without any specific microsimulation model. The paper suggests that \u201conly a significant increase of the benefit level results in considerably higher poverty reduction impacts.\u201d These impacts are -1.9 percentage points and -5.4 percentage points. Statistical tests whether these changes are statistically significant would seem important, given the sample size of only 1079 households. In the last example, <a href=\"#bib33\">Salanauskaite and Verbist (2009)</a> evaluate the distributional impacts of a Lithuanian family allowance reform, using EU-SILC data. The authors estimate that an initial reform would produce a 0.5 percentage point reduction in the total poverty headcount, which would increase to a 1.5 percentage points reduction if the reform would be fully implemented. They also remark that these differences are not statistically significant as indicated by the 95% confidence intervals of the pre-reform and post-reform point estimates. Apparently, these authors did not calculate the confidence intervals of the differences in the poverty headcount, which might well have been statistically significant.",

In many static simulations of the first-order effects of policy changes, the simulated variables are calculated using exogenous parameters (e.g. those describing a tax or benefit scheme) and possibly also observed variables (e.g. gross income). In those cases, the statistical issues are simple, as they involve a standard application of sampling theory (cf. <a href=\"#bib23\">Klevmarken, 2002</a>: 256). It makes no difference whether an observed and a simulated variable, or two simulated variables are compared. A paired t-test can be used to assess the statistical significance of the difference of the means of the variables in the baseline and the reform scenario (<a href=\"#bib41\">Swinscow &amp; Campbell, 2002</a>: 71\u201373)<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup>. A paired t-test takes account of the covariation between the two variables, by calculating the difference between the two variables on the individual level, and performing a one-sample t-test on the average of these differences to evaluate whether it is significantly different from zero. The equivalent of the paired t-test for qualitative (nominal) data is the equally simple but little used McNemar's test (<a href=\"#bib41\">Swinscow &amp; Campbell, 2002</a>: 57-59, 90-91). The necessity of taking account of the sampling design may make the calculation of tests of statistical significance considerably more complicated (e.g. <a href=\"#bib43\">Wolter, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Heeringa <i>et al</i>., 2010</a>), but this is also the case for any analysis of survey data. Our point is that the circumstance that we are dealing with microsimulation does not add further complications to these calculations. Furthermore, currently available software can perform this task with relatively little effort by the analyst, also in the case of distributive analyses for which freely available software packages have been developed (cf. supra).",

First, the constant a does not appear, implying that the simulated result of a policy reform that increases income by the same fixed amount for every household or individual has no variance. In fact, the variance of a constant is always zero. Secondly, in the case of most policy reforms b will be positive and will be close to one. This means that the variance of D is much smaller than the variance of X, and also much smaller than the variance of Y, which (given <a href=\"#eqn2\">Equation 2</a>) is equal to b<sup>2</sup>VAR(X). For example, if b = 1.2, VAR(D) = 0.04*VAR(X) and 0.028*VAR(Y), or, in words, the variance of the difference is only 4 per cent of the variance of the mean of the original variable, and 2.8 per cent of that of the simulated variable. If simulated policy reforms combine new (increased) taxes and benefits, households will re-rank and the covariance can be much lower. However, unless the reform completely overhauls the income distribution, which any remotely plausible policy reform is unlikely to do, the covariance will not become zero or negative. This means that for policy-relevant reforms, the variance of the difference will nearly always be smaller than the variance of the difference under the assumption of having two independent samples (one before and one after the reform). This will be less true if the analysis focuses on very specific income components and/or very specific subgroups. Note also that the covariance is zero if either the original or the simulated variable is a constant value (within the subgroup). In this section, we focused on a very simple linear combination of point estimates. We would like to stress that also for non-linear combinations of point estimates (e.g. a ratio, percentage change, ...) the covariance needs to be taken into account.",

In this example we calculate the effect on mean equivalent disposable household income, poverty and inequality of a policy reform that first abolishes family benefits in Lithuania, and subsequently implements the Estonian system of family transfers. We calculate equivalent household disposable income using the modified OECD scale (cf. <a href=\"#bib4\">Atkinson <i>et al</i>., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Decancq <i>et al</i>., 2013</a>) and we simulate net disposable household income after the policy reforms using the microsimulation model EUROMOD<sup><a href=\"#fn6\">6</a></sup>. We deduct gross family transfers from gross household income and recalculate net incomes by applying all relevant tax and benefit regulations to the new gross household income. Consequently, we obtain a realistic first-order estimate of net income without family transfers (respectively Estonian family transfers implemented in Lithuania), although without taking behavioural effects into account. This type of analysis is quite common in the literature, and issues regarding variance estimation are not different from those when estimating the effect of many other, more complicated policy reforms.

For all three income definitions the width of the 95% confidence interval is close to 100 EUR. The 95% confidence intervals considerably overlap: for average income in the baseline and in the third scenario it ranges from 1472 EUR to 1568 EUR and for average income without family transfers it ranges between 1446 EUR and 1541 EUR. The finding that the confidence intervals overlap does not imply, though, that abolishing family transfers (scenario 2) has no significant effect on average equivalent disposable household. The fourth and sixth row clearly show that even though average income has decreased by just over 26 EUR when the baseline and the second scenario are compared, this difference is highly significant, with the 95% confidence interval being only 3 EUR wide. The effect on average incomes can be estimated with a high degree of precision even though the confidence intervals around average incomes are rather substantial. This is because the covariance between mean income in the baseline and in the reform scenario is so strong: it is equal to 594.5, corresponding to a correlation coefficient of 0.9995. This is a clear illustration of the importance of taking account of the covariance, as discussed above. Note that we would come to exactly the same conclusion if we would calculate first for each person or household individually the difference between income in the reform and in the baseline scenario and subsequently estimate the confidence interval of the average of the difference<sup><a href=\"#fn11\">11</a></sup>. The simulation of the Estonian family benefit system (scenario 3) does not produce a significant effect (on average, results not shown here indicate that there are significant changes in mean income for several subpopulations). Nonetheless, we include this scenario in the example to show that it is also easy to compute standard errors and confidence intervals for the differences between two reform scenarios. On the basis of the sixth row, it can be seen that the implementation of Estonian family benefits in Lithuania would lead to a significant increase in average equivalent disposable household income compared to reform scenario 2. Also in this case, a strong covariance exists between mean income in the two reform scenarios.",

In panel B the poverty threshold is equal to 60 per cent of median equivalent disposable household income in the baseline scenario, but it is assumed to be exogenous and not subject to sampling variance. When family transfers are deducted, the poverty rate rises from 20.2 to 21.6 per cent of the Lithuanian population. Here again, it is clear that even though 95% confidence intervals of both percentages considerably overlap, the difference between them is strongly significant, with the standard error of the difference being much smaller than the standard error of the estimated percentages in poverty. In contrast, if we assume a floating poverty line, calculated at 60 per cent of the median equivalent (simulated) household income, we can observe from panel C that the difference between the various scenarios is smaller and no longer significant. In fact, taking account of the sampling variance of the poverty threshold tends to reduce the standard error of the poverty headcount (for an explanation, see <a href=\"#bib30\">Preston, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Berger &amp; Skinner, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Goedem\u00e9, 2012</a>), but leads in our illustration to larger standard errors for differences between poverty headcounts.",

Adjusting incomes by multiplying them with a fixed factor is similar to what happens routinely in tax-benefit models, and its effects on standard errors and confidence intervals are also automatically taken into account by standard statistical techniques and software. However, other forms of uprating may present bigger difficulties that warrant further investigation in terms of the most accurate and efficient method for estimating the sampling variance. For instance, instead of multiplying certain incomes with a fixed factor, they may be aligned with external sources such that the total income reflects national accounts estimates. In addition, some uprating factors may be based on other sample survey estimates, which adds an additional, independent source of random error.",

                    "text": "Another difficult case are microsimulations using budget-neutral scenarios, where the size of the benefits in the reform scenario is adjusted so that their total matches total expenditure in the baseline scenario (e.g. <a href=\"#bib8\">Clauss &amp; Schubert, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Levy <i>et al</i>., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Salanauskaite &amp; Verbist, 2013</a>). This induces dependence between the baseline and the reform scenario that could affect the covariance in an unpredictable way. The same is true for estimating the effect of reform scenarios in a dynamic model that incorporates behavioural effects, or any other reform that includes some stochastic element (e.g. <a href=\"#bib20\">Immervoll <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Ericson &amp; Flood, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Navicke <i>et al</i>., 2013</a>; for a survey of techniques applied in dynamic modelling, see <a href=\"#bib25\">Li &amp; O\u2019Donoghue, 2013</a>). Future research could assess whether, for instance, bootstrapping the effect would result in an accurate estimate of the sampling variance and whether more naive estimates of the variance, ignoring this dependence, result in strongly biased variance estimates or not. Previous papers have already addressed parts of these questions (e.g. <a href=\"#bib31\">Pudney &amp; Sutherland, 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Klevmarken, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Creedy <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>), but have so far not resulted in universally applicable solutions and user-friendly software. The same is true for testing the impact of monte-carlo variance in dynamic simulations, i.e. the variance induced by randomly sampled model inputs; cf. <a href=\"#bib28\">O\u2019Hagan <i>et al</i>. (2007)</a>. More research is needed for estimating the confidence intervals of the effects of more complex simulations, and especially the development of software to enable microsimulation practitioners to perform proper statistical tests for complex analyses with relative ease. Our discussion is limited to microsimulation studies in the field of income distribution and poverty. In other fields, such as health, microsimulation practitioners seem to have greater awareness of statisticial issues of uncertainty and accuracy. See, for example, <a href=\"#bib28\">O\u2019Hagen <i>et al</i>. (2007)</a> and <a href=\"#bib36\">Sharif <i>et al</i>. (2012)</a>. Cross-field exchange of techniques and methods might be of great benefit.",

In many situations, sampling variance is an important source of uncertainty, and standard statistical techniques suffice to perform the appropriate test of significance (though the sample design may complicate matters). Furthermore, standard routines have been developed which make it possible for applied researchers to calculate the sampling variance, while taking the sample design into account, of relatively complex statistics such as relative poverty, inequality measures and indicators of polarization, with relative ease and a limited time investment. Very helpful in this regard, is the software developed at the Universit\u00e9 Laval (<a href=\"#bib13\">Duclos &amp; Araar, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Araar &amp; Duclos, 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2009</a>). Therefore, we would like to encourage practitioners of microsimulation to use these routines and to estimate and report standard errors and confidence intervals for their results. As <a href=\"#bib23\">Klevmarken (2002</a>: 264) has written \"The credibility of [microsimulation models] with the research community as well as with users will in the long run depend on the application of sound principles of inference in the estimation, testing and validation of these models.\"",

Furthermore, also the characteristics of the indicator of interest and the structure of the sample design should be properly taken into account.",

However, this cannot be an excuse for not making and reporting tests of statistical significance. Reporting a less than ideal test (and mentioning the shortcomings) is still far better than totally ignoring sampling variability and other sources of uncertainty. While new research is necessary to develop user-friendly software and procedures that can accommodate more complex problems, microsimulation researchers could and should make use of the user- friendly software for statistical tests that is already available to them.",
