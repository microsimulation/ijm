While microsimulation models are well suited to study the impact of COVID \u2014both from an epidemiological perspective and from a distributional and public economics perspective\u2014 and a number of analyses have been produced or are undergoing using this approach, this issue does not include any of them. Publication lags imply that this is entirely a pre-COVID issue, perhaps providing a breath of oxygen to many of us who confront daily with the challenges posed by the new emergency.

This is important for dynamic microsimulation models as they often include projections of labour supply behaviour at the extensive margin. We show that the reasons for the low performance of the US labour market are evenly split in structural motives, i.e. the characteristics of the population becoming less favourable to participation over time, and behavioural motives, i.e. the returns to characteristics becoming less favourable to participation.",
