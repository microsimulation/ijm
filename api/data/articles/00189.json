                "text": "We developed a microsimulation model, Care&WorkMOD, to estimate the economic costs of early exit from the labour force, both for informal carers and the government, from 2015 to 2030. In this paper, we describe the methods used to create the model Care&WorkMOD, and the sources of data and model assumptions. Care&WorkMOD is based on the unit record data of people aged 15\u201364 years in the three Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Surveys of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC) 2003, 2009 and 2012. Population and the labour force projections from the 2015 Intergenerational Report and the outputs of an Australian microsimulation model APPSIM were used for the static aging of the base data to every five years from 2015 to 2030. The 2015 output dataset of another microsimulation model STINMOD was linked with Care&WorkMOD base data using synthetic matching. The matching process has added data on further economic variables from STINMOD into Care&WorkMOD, which are not available in SDACs. Economic data were indexed based on long-term trends on economic variables to capture the projected economic growth from 2015 to 2030. Care&WorkMOD can provide the long-term estimates of the lost labour productivity due to informal caring responsibilities and the related economic burden both at the individual and national level, and has the potential to \u201cfill the gaps\u201d in the current body of evidence on the costs of chronic diseases, particularly related to informal carers.",

Informal carers are important as they provide a service to the government that would otherwise need to be paid for by employed carers (<a href=\"#bib15\">Diminic <i>et al</i>., 2017</a>). Similarly, informal carers allow for \u2018ageing in place\u2019, with the aged population remaining in their homes instead of moving to aged care facilities (<a href=\"#bib11\">Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing, 2014</a>). Government spending on \u2018aged care\u2019, which is separate to informal carers, was $16.2 billion in 2016 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aged Care Financing Authority, 2017</a>). The majority of informal carers are female (<a href=\"#bib25\">Nepal, Brown, Ranmuthugala, &amp; Percival, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Stacey, Gill, Price, Warmington, &amp; Taylor, 2016</a>), aged 25\u201364, and the burden of informal care often leads to reduced labour force participation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Access Economics, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Deloitte Access Economics, 2015</a>). Informal carers were estimated to be providing 1.9 billion hours of care in 2015, with each carer providing an average of 13 hours per week. The replacement cost of informal care in 2015 in Australia was estimated to be A$60.3 billion, equivalent to 3.8% of the gross domestic product and 60% of the health and social work industry (<a href=\"#bib13\">Deloitte Access Economics, 2015</a>).",

At the same time, the need for informal carers is increasingly taking on greater relevance as the burden of disease transitions from acute fatal diseases to long-term chronic diseases (<a href=\"#bib40\">Stacey <i>et al</i>., 2016</a>). Indeed, it has been argued that if this care was not provided informally to people with mental illness, the Australian National and state/territory governments would need to spend A$13.2 billion to provide the same level of health and social services (<a href=\"#bib15\">Diminic <i>et al</i>., 2017</a>). Many studies have shown that informal carers that have reduced work hours are more likely to leave the labour force and have lower incomes compared to non-carers (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bittman, Hill, &amp; Thomson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gray &amp; Edwards, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Adams, 2010</a>).

A number of microsimulation models have been developed to estimate the demand for care (<a href=\"#bib30\">Percival &amp; Kelly, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chin &amp; Harding, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Pickard, Wittenberg, Comas-Herrara, Kink, &amp; Mallay, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lymer, Brown, Harding, &amp; Yap, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Nepal, Brown, Kelly, Percival, Anderson, &amp; Hancock, 2011</a>). An Australian study, based on the 1998 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC) and the 2001 Census data, produced small area estimates of disability levels and the need for aged care across age groups, in order to allow the execution of social policy and elderly care services for older Australians (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chin &amp; Harding, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lymer <i>et al</i>., 2009</a>). These studies reported that as age increases both the presence and severity of disability increase, indicating a higher requirement for care, and particular geographic areas had higher needs for provision of care (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lymer <i>et al</i>., 2009</a>). Recent microsimulation studies have been used to quantify how much policies cost, rates of growth of costs, the distribution of expenditure, regional differences in health, and whether the health labour force will be sufficient to match the future needs for health care (<a href=\"#bib37\">Schofield, Shresta, Kelly <i>et al</i>., 2014</a>). Microsimulation models are useful at a national level, by modelling the records of individuals from national surveys, with the ability to examine the effects of policy changes for well-defined ranges of individuals or demographic groups, as well as for national aggregates.",

The projections for informal carers to 2031, as well as other forecasts for the next ten years, show that the demand for informal carers is growing at a faster rate than the supply, meaning the ratio of carers \u201csupply to demand\u201d is likely to substantially decrease in future decades (<a href=\"#bib13\">Deloitte Access Economics, 2015</a>). Reasons for this include couples having fewer children, increasing life expectancy, increasing geographic distance between parents and children, and a higher retirement age (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pickard <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>), with trends reported to be similar in Australia (<a href=\"#bib42\">The Treasury, 2015a</a>, <a href=\"#bib43\">2015b</a>). In Australia, the Australian Government\u2019s commitment to caring for the elderly at home (\u2018ageing at home\u2019), rather than in care (<a href=\"#bib11\">Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing, 2014</a>), is likely to increase the proportion of the population who are informal carers. Financial support through the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) may also influence the proportion of informal carers, however, it is too early to tell impacts of the NDIS on the number of carers. Similarly, microsimulation has shown that the substantial increase in years lived with disability (YLDs) over the past 20 years has also increased the demand for informal carers (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schofield, 2016</a>). Although there have been several microsimulation models projecting the demand for carers, there have been none estimating the long-term economic impact of the provision of informal care on both carers themselves, as well as on the government.",

The model is maintained and developed by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM) at the University of Canberra. This model is based on a random sample of 1% of the 2001 Australian Census of Population and Housing data (about 188,000 records of individuals) and simulates the impact of social and fiscal policies on every Australian. As each simulated year passes, a range of events including birth, death, migration, divorce, labour force participation, and retiring are simulated in the model. The probability of each of these events occurring is based on probability tables or logistic regression equations from historical data. By simulating birth, death and migration, the model allows the simulated population to change and age over time. APPSIM outputs a simulated dataset representative of the socio-demographic and economic characteristics of the Australian population for each year to 2030. We extracted APPSIM output datasets for individuals aged 15\u201364 years in five-year intervals from 2015 to 2030.",

In APPSIM, whether or not an individual was a primary carer was modelled in two steps (<a href=\"#bib19\">Keegan &amp; Kelly, 2009</a>). First, a multivariate regression model based on socio-demographic information on individuals and their family members was used to estimate the probability an individual in APPSIM had carer duties and then whether or not that individual was a primary carer was modelled using a Monte Carlo simulation method. We estimated the age- and sex-specific rates of primary carers for the 2010 APPSIM output dataset. These rates were then compared with the estimated SDAC rates for 2010 based on a linear trend between SDAC 2009 and 2012 rates to estimate an alignment factor for APPSIM rates of primary carers to align with SDAC rates. The APPSIM age- and sex-specific rates of primary carers for 2015 to 2030 were calibrated with the alignment factor to re-estimate the projected age- and sex-specific rates of primary carers for 2015 to 2030 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

The base datasets for Care&amp;WorkMOD are based on 2003, 2009 and 2012 Australian populations. In Care&amp;WorkMOD we used static ageing to capture changes in socio-demographic structure of the population (such as ageing, labour force participation, demand for informal carers) from the survey years 2003, 2009 and 2012 to Care&amp;WorkMOD base year of 2015 (and other modelled years to 2030). The survey data are weighted by the ABS to address the issue of unequal probability of selection in the surveys, and to make the survey data as close as possible a representation of the Australian population in the year of survey (<a href=\"#bib5\">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2016</a>). Each record in the survey datasets has a survey weight assigned to take into account the individual\u2019s probability of selection and the clustering and the stratification of the sample. The weighting reflects the number of people with comparable characteristics in the Australian population at the particular survey year. We reweighted the SDAC 2003, 2009 and 2012 to reflect the profile of the subsample aged 15\u201364 years in 2015 and other modelled years (2020, 2025, 2030), using an algorithm based on generalised regression reweighting techniques, coded in a SAS macro called GREGWT, developed by the ABS (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bell, 2000</a>). It uses the generalised regression method to modify initial survey weights such that the new weighted totals match the externally provided totals known as benchmarks. The mathematical technique of GREGWT is described in detail in <a href=\"#bib39\">Singh and Mohl (1996)</a> and <a href=\"#bib41\">Tanton, Vidyattama, Nepal, and McNamara (2011)</a>.",

The process was described in detail in <a href=\"#bib34\">Schofield, Cunich, Shrestha <i>et al</i>. (2014)</a>. Briefly, the process involves identifying a set of matching variables that are common to both datasets (i.e. the reweighted SDAC and STINMOD output), and strongly related to the main outcome of interest. We used \u201cincome\u201d as our main outcome and nine variables (<a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>) as matching variables in Care&amp;WorkMOD. During the matching process, unit records in two datasets are first grouped into homogeneous cells based on  the  matching variables. Each  unit record within  a cell  from  one dataset  is then synthetically linked with the closest matching record, with replacement (an unconstrained matching), from the corresponding cell of another dataset. We used a standardized Euclidean distance method with the distance based on all nine matching variables to identify the closest matching records between the corresponding cells of the reweighted SDAC and STINMOD output datasets. In order to avoid creating cells which have records in concatenated SDAC dataset but no record in STINMOD, which will result in the missing data for those records in the synthetic dataset, we prioritised the matching variables and grouped them into two groups; with priority matching variables grouped into Group A (<a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>). Cells were first created based on Group A variables and the records in each cell were further grouped into smaller cells based on Group B variables. In some instances, cells were created using a fewer number of Group B variables to avoid having cells with no record in STINMOD when we have records in the SDAC dataset for the corresponding cells. If there was a cell with no matching record in STINMOD, we grouped those cells with a neighbouring cell. The method of creating cells for synthetic matching is described in detail in <a href=\"#bib37\">Schofield, Shrestha, Kelly, <i>et al</i>. (2014)</a>.",

Since then, microsimulation modelling has evolved to use current computing power and available datasets, allowing sophisticated dynamic microsimulation modelling. The use of a dynamic microsimulation model for long-term projections is now wide spread and well- established (<a href=\"#bib21\">Li &amp; O\u2019Donoghue, 2013</a>). In a dynamic microsimulation model, individuals transit from one stage to another in regular unit of time, commonly every year, based on transition probabilities. With this, the model can simulate a life trajectory of an individual, such as informal carers\u2019 entry to labour market, exit from the labour market, re-entry into the market and permanently exit from the labour market. This allows the simulation of working years of every individual in the model. However, building a dynamic microsimulation model is resource intensive, time consuming and can be costly (<a href=\"#bib27\">O\u2019Donoghue, Li, &amp; Dekkers 2014</a>). In this instance, we chose the less complex and labour intensive model structure. We therefore built a static microsimulation model, Care&amp;WorkMOD, which uses static ageing through reweighting data and synthetic matching methods instead of building it as a dynamic microsimulation model. Static ageing is defined here as a model that simulates time indirectly through uprating or \u2018reweighting\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dekkers, Keegan, &amp; O\u2019Donoghue, 2014</a>). In contrast, dynamic modelling alters the content of the dataset itself over time. We also have utilized the output datasets of two well-established Australian microsimulation models APPSIM and STINMOD in the process. The main advantage of building a microsimulation model this way is that it is faster to assemble, less computationally intensive and can take advantage of existing microsimulation models. However, as Care&amp;WorkMOD depends upon outputs of APPSIM and STINMOD, its robustness depends upon the strength of APPSIM and STINMOD simulations and any underlying limitations in APPSIM and STINMOD will be carried over to Care&amp;WorkMOD. For example, APPSIM does not have geographical subdivisions information and as a result, Care&amp;WorkMOD has no geographical division information in its datasets. Thus, it limits the use of Care&amp;WorkMOD to estimate the economic costs of informal carers\u2019 early exit from the labour force only for individuals (i.e. informal carers) and the Commonwealth Government at a national level. The model does not provide the estimates at a state or regional level, which are outside the scope of Care&amp;WorkMOD project. Since both APPSIM and STINMOD are well-established Australian models and are widely used (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lambert, Percival, Schofield, &amp; Paul, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Percival <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Keegan &amp; Kelly, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lymer, 2009</a>), this gives confidence in the robustness of their output.",

It is not possible to directly match SDAC records with STINMOD records because they use different samples, so the individuals in each survey are not the same people. Most importantly, the ABS does not allow an exact matching based on nine matching variables to create a synthetic population dataset, which is nationally representative sample of the Australian population. We therefore linked records from SDAC and STINMOD using synthetic matching based on nine matching variables to create a synthetic dataset which includes information from both original datasets.

Care&WorkMOD has all SDAC records matched with STINMOD records of the same categories for up to five matching variables, with about 95% records matched for each of the nine matching variables.

This means that there may be inherent differences in the distributions of economic variables in STINMOD and Care&WorkMOD, and as a result there is the potential for the distributions of economic variables not used as synthetic matching variables in Care&WorkMOD to be different from the original distributions in STINMOD. We note that one limitation of this study is that female carers aged 35\u201364 years were a higher proportion in actual SDAC 2015 data than projected (from the 2012 data). This indicates that these estimates are conservative and the number of informal carers may be higher.",

Findings from this microsimulation model may be used internationally, where other countries have the appropriate data available. Given that the population is ageing and the demand for informal caring is increasing in many countries, estimates of the economic costs of informal caring may be used to inform health polices across the globe. Economic impacts of informal carers leaving the workforce early for both individuals in terms of lost incomes and the National Governments in terms of additional welfare costs and lost tax revenues are likely to grow in future given most countries have a growing population of informal carers. Indeed, around 13% of people aged 50 and over report providing informal care at least weekly, and more than 20% in the Czech Republic and Belgium (<a href=\"#bib6\">Basu, Seligman &amp; Bhattacharya 2013</a>). It is noteworthy that the lowest rates of daily informal provision are found in Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark and the Netherlands, where the formal long-term care network is well developed and government provided coverage is thorough and comprehensive (<a href=\"#bib6\">Basu, Seligman, &amp; Bhattacharya, 2013</a>). Results from microsimulation on lost income and welfare payments can be used to inform government policymakers about the likely impacts on national productivity, and ways to increase workforce participation and standard of living of informal carers of chronic disease.",
