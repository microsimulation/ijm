After presenting a brief survey of microsimulation models and applications we describe the main features of the approach and how these are implemented in practice. We pay particular attention to the innovative features of dynamic microsimulation as a method of ex-ante policy evaluation. The final section presents a critical overview of the most recent health-dedicated dynamic microsimulation models including POHEM and FEM, two of the most comprehensive dynamic microsimulation models for health. We describe how these models are used to simulate lifecycle health trajectories and associated health care costs under competing policy scenarios to illustrate the power of microsimulation as a valid and relevant tool for policy evaluation.",

For this reason, the search and identification of tools capable of evaluating the costs and benefits of competing health interventions have attracted growing attention by governments and policy makers. Establishing the effectiveness of health policies is also central to understanding their value in improving health and reducing inequalities in health. However, there exists a substantial gap between the evidence base and the formulation of health policies, particularly in fields such as public health (<a href=\"#bib83\">Wanless, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allin et al., 2005</a>) where methodological and practical challenges often restrict the ability to undertake robust policy evaluation (<a href=\"#bib67\">Petticrew et al., 2004</a>). Accounting for issues such as population heterogeneity, multiple outcomes, spillovers and externalities and the capacity to capture the long-run effects of an intervention pose substantial challenges for the identification of the effects of a policy that hamper traditional methods for policy evaluation.",

In order to measure a treatment effect, commonly employed techniques such as matching, instrumental variables, control functions, regression discontinuity designs and difference-in-differences require the availability of data on individuals in a control and treated group and often both before and after the implementation of the policy under scrutiny. A fundamental requirement of all ex-post evaluation techniques is, however, that the policy has been implemented. In contrast, ex-ante policy evaluation methods, such as microsimulation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bouguingon &amp; Spadaro, 2006</a>) and structural modelling (<a href=\"#bib78\">Todd &amp; Wolpin, 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Wolpin, 2007</a>) attempt to overcome the requirement to collect data post-implementation by simulating the response. The simulated response under the policy can then be compared to the simulated response assuming either no change or a competing policy to evaluate the impact under alternative relevant scenarios. The flexibility afforded by the simulation approach broadens the scope of the evaluation problem beyond the identification of quantities such as an average treatment effect when assessing the impact of an intervention on a specific outcome of interest.",

First, ex-ante evaluation has the ability to predict the potential impact of a series of policies as well as the impact of a specific policy under different scenarios. Second, an ex-ante appraisal can identify ineffective programmes before they are rolled-out and hence avoid the potentially high cost of implementation and subsequent withdrawal. Third, by providing evidence on the likely impacts of a policy, ex-ante evaluation can complement and inform subsequent ex-post evaluation of the same programme. For these reasons ex-ante evaluation offers an important tool to inform the design of policies, their implementation and subsequent refinement.",

The application of these techniques has, however, largely focused on simulating tax-benefit and pension systems and extensions to the evaluation of health and health-related policies is still limited (<a href=\"#bib77\">Spielauer, 2007</a>). Microsimulation techniques simulate individual behavioural responses at a micro-level of policies yet to be implemented. The method attempts to mimic a natural experiment with the major difference that instead of outcomes being observed following a policy shock, they are simulated or imputed on the basis of a set of assumptions about the behavioural reactions of individuals following changes in the economic environment brought about by the introduction of a policy. Accordingly, a fundamental consideration is the quality of the model used to predict behavioural responses. One of the main advantages offered by the approach is the ability to account for the widest heterogeneity possible within the population of interest together with a focus of analysis at an individual level allowing the identification of both the mean and distributional impact of a reform. Moreover, dynamic microsimulation techniques are capable of measuring the effects of a policy across a number of time-horizons allowing for both short-run and long-run effects to be assessed.",

In order to facilitate and improve model predictions, he underlined the necessity to correctly characterise the behaviour and interactions of the elemental decision-making units (individuals, households or firms) within the socioeconomic system represented. Further, in describing the mechanics of this new type of approach, he suggested the recursive and discrete-time structure that still represents the benchmark for the majority of current dynamic microsimulation models.

At their core, microsimulation models consist of two main components: a micro-dataset and a model that informs behavioural change under both current (or a default) and counterfactual policy scenarios. Although microsimulation models differ widely due to the structure and characteristics of the model used to represent individual behaviour (e.g. whether based on a behavioural structural model and a dynamic or static framework), the key feature embedded in all microsimulation models is the ability to generate individual-level data under different policy scenarios. For example, behavioural microsimulation models of labour supply, used to evaluate the impact of fiscal policies on individuals\u2019 employment transitions, incorporate arithmetical tax-benefit models that produce net incomes for different tax-benefit regimes. In contrast, dynamic microsimulation models project population samples over time, modelling life course events (such as household formation and dissolution, education, health and labour market status, etc.) under various policy rules.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup>",

In the case of a tax-benefit model, arithmetical microsimulation simply simulates the change in real disposable income of individuals, following the introduction of a tax reform under the assumption that individual behaviour is unchanged (i.e. individual behaviour is exogenous to the tax-benefit system). Although based on this restrictive assumption, arithmetical microsimulation models are useful in illuminating the first-round effects of a reform and identifying the gainers and losers together with their characteristics. This will provide an approximation of the impact of the reform on individuals\u2019 welfare. Information at the individual level can be aggregated and compared between policy-relevant social groups and analysed using social welfare indicators such as inequality and poverty indices (<a href=\"#bib6\">Atkinson et al., 2002</a>). Further, <a href=\"#bib13\">Bourguignon &amp; Spadaro (2006)</a> show that the arithmetic evaluation approach, when used for the purpose of measuring changes in individual and social welfare and under certain conditions (when a reform causes marginal changes only to individuals\u2019 budget constraints and individuals are optimising exclusively on the basis of their budget constraint) is consistent with the presence of behavioural responses. Arithmetical models have been used to examine indirect taxes and tax reforms both in developed and developing countries (<a href=\"#bib23\">Creedy, 1999</a>; Sahn, 2003); to estimate the incidence of public spending in education and health (<a href=\"#bib28\">Demery, 2003</a>) and to test and compare the effects of fiscal polices in different countries of the European Union (<a href=\"#bib5\">Atkinson et al., 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Callan &amp; Sutherland, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">De Lathouwer, 1996</a>). A number of governmental and research institutions currently use arithmetical microsimulation models to estimate the budgetary and distributional impacts of a range of hypothetical and actual policy changes (within the UK these include, the HM Treasury Inter-Governmental Tax Model, IGOTM, the Pension Policy Simulation, PPS, model of the Department for Work and Pensions and the tax-benefit model of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, TAXBEN).",

This means that changes to institutional, market or individual characteristics affect directly the behaviour of the micro-units within the model. A distinctive characteristic of such models is that the behavioural responses are grounded on economic theory and commonly involve the estimation of structural econometric models. Tax-benefit models that incorporate labour supply responses are typical examples of behavioural microsimulation models (<a href=\"#bib24\">Creedy &amp; Duncan, 2002</a>). For such models, changes in the tax-benefit system directly affect an individual\u2019s budget constraint which in turn may lead to a change in labour supplied. The purpose of these models is to provide an exact prediction of the change in labour supply under alternative tax-benefit scenarios, and the characteristics of the individuals impacted by the policy. To illustrate the characteristics of a behavioural microsimulation model we use labour supply as an example.",

Under this approach, an individuals\u2019 labour supply is approximated through a discrete-choice variable that can assume only a finite number of values within a set of hours worked. Each hour band corresponds to a given level of utility as defined by the budget constraint. While this method resolves part of the difficulties related to nonlinear tax schedules, rounding errors in the definition of hour levels can be introduced and it is good practice to undertake sensitivity analysis (Duncan and Harris, 2002).",

The behavioural model of labour supply described in the previous section can be considered an example of a static microsimulation model as it considers an individual\u2019s employment response to a policy in the current period. In contrast dynamic models adopt a life-cycle perspective and project the population structure through time. This consists of the creation of a synthetic population through the simulation of individuals\u2019 life trajectories using what are termed static or dynamic ageing techniques. Static ageing produces projections of the population over time by simply re-weighting parts of the sample according to the future expected characteristics of the population with weights usually set using official population projections. The underlying demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of individuals remain constant over time with changes to the weight attached to each individual to produce the synthetic future population. In contrast, dynamic ageing is based on the creation of transition probabilities to update individual demographic and economic characteristics over time. Accordingly, the demographic and socioeconomic profile of the synthetic population is based on the assumptions implicit in the underlying transition probabilities. While static ageing simply brings a population sample into line with external estimates at a specific point in time, dynamic ageing is concerned with the underlying economic and social processes which generate changes within the population (<a href=\"#bib91\">Zaidi &amp; Rake, 2001</a>).",

Microsimulation models based on ageing techniques incorporate Monte Carlo simulation methods to generate a stochastic process that determines individual transition probabilities. These are used to update the characteristics of individuals over time. The implementation of the Monte Carlo simulation will depend on whether the model is assumed to operate in discrete or continuous time. This is discussed in more detail below.",

The procedure consists of breaking down the continuous time frame into a series of discrete spells and considering the simulation of a set of events (transitions) within these spells. The length of the spells can vary according to the specific needs of the modeller but most applications use spell lengths of one year (<a href=\"#bib86\">Willekens, 2009</a>). In this framework, transitions from one state to another occur by comparing the simulated time to transition for each specific event with the length of the time spell. For example, if we consider spells of the length of <i>n</i> years and a simulated time to transition, <i>t</i>, the transition occurs during the first spell <i>n</i> if the simulated time to transitions is less than <i>n</i>, (<i>t &lt; n</i>). This framework also accounts for repeatable events (i.e. events that can occur more than once such as child birth, labour market and health transitions). Assuming that an event is repeatable and its first occurrence is at <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> if <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> &lt; <i>n</i>, the event occurs a second time during the same spell if a second draw of a random number from the uniform distribution <i>U</i> ~ <i>U</i>[0,1] generates a simulated time to transition <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> that is less than or equal to <i>n</i> \u2013 <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> (<i>t</i><sub>2</sub> \u2264 <i>n</i> \u2013 <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>).

However, the authors make the valid point that the majority of data available for microsimulation are collected on an annual basis making the choice of a discrete-time model that operates with annual probabilities a natural one. Further, Zaidi and Rake emphasise the possibility to model certain events using shorter time periods within a discrete-time setting, for example using monthly transitions. In his review of dynamic microsimulation models, <a href=\"#bib77\">Spielauer (2007)</a> also appears to favour the use of continuous and pseudo-continuous (monthly steps) dynamic microsimulation. More recently, <a href=\"#bib86\">Willekens (2009)</a> suggests that continuous-time dynamic microsimulation modelling overcomes three fundamental problems that are intrinsic in the use of discrete-time modelling.

The credibility of a dynamic microsimulation model is based on its capacity to reproduce observed data or known benchmarks such as official population projections. Accordingly, an important aspect of dynamic microsimulation modelling is the validation of results produced by the simulation exercise. Interestingly, the applied literature has devoted little attention to validation procedures and the quantification of uncertainty around model predictions (<a href=\"#bib88\">Wolf, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Klevmarken, 2002</a>). Moreover, among practitioners there is currently no apparent consensus on what constitutes best practice. In the majority of applications, discrepancies between simulation outputs and some external benchmark are often resolved using alignment techniques. In general, alignment consists of adjustment of the simulation output in order to reflect the expected proportion of certain events in a population. Alignment methods applied to dynamic microsimulation have significantly evolved in the past few years and vary widely (Morrison, 2006). In the case of a hierarchical or recursive model such as the one depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> of <a href=\"#s2-3-1\">Section 2.3.1</a>, a \u201cpiece-meal\u201d validation procedure can be used (<a href=\"#bib54\">Klevmarken, 2002</a>) where validation is performed separately for each sub-model.

Monte Carlo errors are associated with the use of a particular set of random draws in the stochastic process that generates individual trajectories.

(2009)</a> recently developed <i>Health&amp;WealthMOD</i>, a microsimulation model concerned with the impacts of health and disability on labour force participation, income and the Australian government\u2019s revenues and expenditures. The model combines survey data on disability with data on income and taxes produced by STINMOD together with information on future individual wealth from DYNAMOD, two of NATSEM\u2019s microsimulation models. Early applications of <i>Health&amp;WealthMOD</i> quantify the impact of lost taxation revenue and increases in government transfer payments due to mental health conditions (<a href=\"#bib73\">Schofield et al., 2011a</a>) and long-term illness (<a href=\"#bib74\">Schofield et al., 2011b</a>).",

In this module, the prediction of the health status of the cohorts entails three main steps. First, age-specific prevalence rates are obtained for each chronic disease considered (heart disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer, cancer, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and disability status using data from the NHIS. Second, age-incidence trajectories are created combining information on successive disease prevalence and disease-specific death rates from the US Vital Statistics. Third, age-specific prevalence rates and disease-specific trajectories generated in the previous two steps are used to predict and adjust the health status of the incoming Medicare sample.<sup><a href=\"#fn15\">15</a></sup>",

The first is to present an overview of microsimulation <i>methods</i> and <i>applications</i> that are relevant for the purpose of health policy evaluation. The second is to present a review of existing dynamic microsimulation models that include a health component together with the most recent and comprehensive models focused on health. Throughout the paper we have illustrated the power of dynamic microsimulation as a valid tool for the evaluation of health policies and hope we have made a case for the greater use of these approaches. Dynamic microsimulation offers a number of important advantages over more standard methods of ex-post policy evaluation. First, by simulating data under alternative scenarios, dynamic microsimulation allows for the evaluation of outcomes of interest prior to actual implementation of a policy. Secondly, by projecting individual socioeconomic and health trajectories over multiple periods of time, dynamic microsimulation techniques readily incorporate heterogeneity in estimated treatment effects together with the long-run effects of treatment. Finally, dynamic microsimulation can additionally be used to identify better externalities and spillovers in treatment.",

These assumptions need to be credible for the microsimulation exercise to have validity. Further, while estimates of behavioural microsimulation models have the advantage of being grounded on economic theory, they tend to be policy-specific and difficult to extend to alternative contexts. Dynamic microsimulation models that project the characteristics of a population over time usually include the simulation of a series of interacting micro-processes such as demographic, labour market and health dynamics. The way in which these processes interact with each other represents the core of a dynamic microsimulation model. These interactions are however rarely justified using structural models. That is, dynamic microsimulation models often include very limited behavioural components.",
