Recent developments have adjusted static microsimulation models to incorporate behavioural responses (e.g. IZA\u03a8MOD (<a href=\"#bib8\">Peichl <i>et al</i>., 2010</a>)). Predicting the distributional impact of a policy over time is another use of microsimulation techniques. static microsimulation model can be used to forecast the impact of a policy by using static aging techniques which require information about the population structure over the forecasting period. This technique applies adjusting factors that take into account the changes in population structure, inflation, gross income distribution and policy rules over time. The changes in the population structure are incorporated by applying weighting techniques that re-weight the sample such that the external control total is aligned with the forecasted year, rather than the year of the survey. Changes in inflation and incomes are incorporated via \"uprating factors\" and the policy rules are updated to match the desired reform levels.",

The statistical dynamic models incorporate the life cycle dimension via dynamic aging techniques which project households/individuals forward in time by simulating transitions at the individual level (e.g. changes in demographic characteristics, education, labour market situation).

Behavioural dynamic models add the behavioural responses to changes in policies (<a href=\"#bib6\">Li &amp; O\u2019Donoghue, 2013</a>).

Building a microsimulation model is a long and costly process, and much can be gained from sharing knowledge, especially in fields such as microsimulation. Chapter 13 (Philippe Li\u00e9geois and Gijs Dekkers) underlines the efficiency gains from building on existing work. The chapter discusses the first attempt to combine an existing static tax-benefit microsimulation model EUROMOD, which is used to simulate the immediate impact of changes in the tax-benefit system (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bargain, 2007</a>) with an existing dynamic microsimulation forward-looking population model (MIDAS-LU), which accommodates demographic developments, policy hypotheses and evolutions, and behavioural responses. MIDAS_LU is itself based on a pre-existing framework (LIAM \u2013 The Life-Cycle Income Analysis Model), which was created by <a href=\"#bib7\">O\u2019Donoghue, Hynes and Lennon (2009)</a>, and further developed by <a href=\"#bib2\">Dekkers <i>et al</i>. (2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2010)</a> while building the model MIDAS for Belgium, Germany and Italy. The chapter gives an example of a rapid model prototyping using an existing framework. Model builders interested in building a dynamic model may consider embedding an existing static model in a dynamic framework, and this chapter is an excellent starting point.",

Chapter 2 (Ben Anderson, Paola De Agostini and Tony Lawson) proposes a toolkit which combines dynamic and spatial microsimulation techniques for exploring the spatial impact of rising prices and/or taxes on household expenditure on public and private transport and communication technology from 2006 to 2016 in the UK. Their approach is formed of three components aimed to produce small area estimates of future household expenditure over time: a spatial projection based on small area statistics for specific household attributes using historical census tables, a demographic projection which involved projecting a household population sample with their household attributes, income and expenditure patterns, and the development of a demand system model linking household expenditures, household attributes and time. This approach is useful for the evaluation of socio-spatial policies.",

In Chapter 6, the authors build a nursing supply model to project the labour supply of nurses in France until 2030. This approach is useful for policy makers wishing to investigate trends in the demography of medical staff and to predict future shortages in health workforce under the impact of different public policies.",

The extended model is used to simulate the consumption of healthcare and elderly care in Sweden under different long-term mortality and morbidity scenarios.

Educational attainment is highly correlated with labour market outcomes and demographic events, therefore it is highly relevant for pensions and labour supply projections. While most microsimulation models treat education in a superficial manner, in the MOSART model, which is used to analyse the pension system, public expenditure and labour supply, education is treated as an important factor in explaining individual behaviour in the labour market and other outcomes through life. From a policy perspective, such complex models are particularly useful when projecting public expenditures because labour market participation is strongly dependent on education. For projecting labour supply, such a model is useful for detecting future imbalances in the labour market between demand and supply by both educational level and field by analysing the effects of changes in demographic factors and educational behaviour.",

On the \u201cinput\u201d side, Chapter 19 (Gijs Dekkers) takes the first steps to opening the \u201cblack box\u201d of a pension dynamic microsimulation model. The chapter proposes a stylized approach to describe the fundamental relationships between core model parameters (e.g. pension indexation in conjunction with demographic ageing) and the simulated trends in pension income inequality. This approach is proposed as a potential validation strategy for dynamic microsimulations. On the \u201coutput\u201d side, Chapter 14 (Jinjing Li and Cathal O\u2019Donoghue) fills a gap in the dynamic microsimulation literature by discussing the theoretical and statistical criteria for alignment techniques. Alignment techniques have been developed in the microsimulation literature to correct for the inadequacy of micro-projections. They are usually defined in the literature as \u201cconstraining the model output to conform more closely with externally derived macro-data\u201d (<a href=\"#bib10\">Scott, 2001</a>). As all simulation results depend on alignment, the chapter underlines the importance of understanding the impact of different alignment techniques and choosing the appropriate technique for the scope of the analysis.",

Chapter 3 (Cathal O\u2019Donoghue, Jason Loughrey and Karyn Morrissey) utilizes a framework that combines a static tax-benefit microsimulation model applied on household survey data with decomposition techniques to understand the impact of the economic crisis on income inequality in Ireland. More specifically, they decompose the changes in inequality over the crisis into the effect of the tax-benefit changes and the pooled effect of labour market and population changes, by generating counterfactual distributions of income under different policy scenarios. Microsimulation techniques are particularly useful methods for counterfactual simulations, which can enhance the understanding of the functioning of tax-benefit systems and their ability to cushion household incomes against adverse economic shocks. Combining microsimulation techniques with decomposition techniques (e.g., <a href=\"#bib4\">Fortin, Lemieux and Firpo (2011)</a>) are the methodological advancement towards understanding the causal factors and explanations for the cross-national differences in income inequality and its alarming trends worldwide.",

The book shows that the field is still being characterized by a relatively slow development due to the high costs required to develop and maintain large models, the limited share of knowledge between model builders and independent know-how build-up. Recent years, however, have witnessed an increase in cross-model knowledge sharing and cooperation, which is expected to accelerate the developments in the field. A few examples are the expansion of the European static tax-benefit microsimulation model (EUROMOD), the development of the dynamic microsimulation model MIDAS using the LIAM framework, and the embedding of the EUROMOD model for Luxembourg in the dynamic microsimulation forward-looking population model MIDAS-LU. These collaborations involve a consortium of national microsimulators and other experts, which prove the added value and the efficiency gain of knowledge sharing in the field of microsimulation.",
