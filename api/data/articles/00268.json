                "text": "The Covid-19 pandemic had a very quick and damaging impact on several economies around the world, including in Morocco. This economy was hit hard with some sectors strongly exposed to the impact on the households and their children. In this article, we built a micro-simulation model and use it jointly with an input-output model to assess the distributional impact of COVID-19 and mitigation measures targeting households in Morocco with a focus on children living in poor households. Our original results show that the crisis has led to a fairly significant increase in poverty, with more pronounced effects in the urban area. Children under 5 years of age and young adults (over 18 years of age) are the most affected. Just over half a million children under the age of 18 would fall into poverty as a result of the pandemic. The mitigation measures put in place by the government and additional measures we designed and simulated further reduce the negative impact of the pandemic. In addition, the number of vulnerable rural population has decreased in both rural and urban areas. However, the two scenarios focusing on mitigation of the effects of the pandemic do not fully compensate for the negative effects of the pandemic in the urban area as opposed to rural areas. When we focus our analysis by age category, the incidence rates of vulnerability decrease to their initial rates for children under 5 years of age and decrease very slightly for youth aged 5 to 17 years at the national level. However, we find that this vulnerability is deeper and more severe even after the implementation of compensatory measures.",

After four months into the pandemic, <a href=\"#bib34\">Bank (2020)</a> projected that Covid-19 would push between 71 and 100 million people into extreme poverty. By late 2021, <a href=\"#bib35\">Lara Lara and Mendez Ramos (2021)</a> estimated that 116 million people fell into extreme poverty. In such a context, it was key to understand and identify to most vulnerable households and investigate public responses to this crisis. <a href=\"#bib29\">Sanchez-Paramo (2020)</a> proposed quick measures targeting the most vulnerable such as cash transfers by relying on existing programs and adding additional ones. In addition, understanding transmission mechanisms between the crisis and government measures to contain the pandemic are also extremely important.",

According to <a href=\"#bib26\">OECD (2020)</a>, the Moroccan economy was hit hard with some sectors strongly exposed such as tourism, air transport, and exporting sectors (textile and automotive). These sectors were affected on the supply and demand sides. Other sectors were less exposed namely the ones with limited face-to-face interaction (telecommunication, finance) and essential sectors such as agro-industries, extraction, and chemical. <a href=\"#bib11\">Haddad et al.

This approach has been used to assess the effects of a carbon tax in Spain by <a href=\"#bib22\">Labandeira and Labeaga (1999)</a>, but to our knowledge has not been used to assess the impact of Covid-19 on child poverty. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to illustrate how this methodology can be used to perform a very detailed distributional analysis. Our secondary objective is to provide a detailed distributional analysis of the impacts of COVID-19 and mitigation measures with a focus on children. This methodology developed and applied to the COVID-19 crisis in Morocco was performed in the early months of the strict confinement in the country. During the early stages of the pandemic, given early indications of strong economic and social negative impact, there was a need and interest to understand the distributional impact of the pandemic and responses. Hence, our analysis provided quick insights in this direction and our microsimulation model remained available for continued monitoring of the evolution of the pandemic. We were able to exploit all early information available to design our simulations.",

We then present the input-output and micro-simulation models developed and adapted to the Moroccan economy, the hypotheses formulated and the data used. Three simulations are proposed: the first will allow us to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on poverty (Covid); with the second, we simulate some of the policies implemented by the country in response to the spread of the virus (scenario 1). Finally, in a third simulation, we run alternative policy responses to attenuate the impact of the crisis on poor households and their children generated by the initial simulation (scenario 2).

Since the price changes presented by the HCP concerned only 12 sectors and we had an input-output model with 39 sectors, we chose to exploit the three largest price changes, convert them according to our nomenclature, and apply these three price changes in the input-output model to generate 39 price changes.

This survey allowed us to approach the actual loss of profits and the loss of jobs by industry (31 industries) amid the crisis and containment. The investigators also asked the companies about their projected loss of profits for the year 2020. For example, a 50% loss of profits corresponds to a reduction in the activity of 6 months, so a worker in this sector will receive 50% of his or her salary income for the year 2020.

In our scenario, all children between the ages of 5 and 17, who are already beneficiaries of at least one of these programs, will receive a lump sum of 100 Dirhams (MAD) per month for six months (from July to December) through their household. In addition to providing financial support to the household due to the crisis, this program aims to discourage school dropouts. This seems to us to be all the more important as the period of cessation will have been long (from March to September). This measure will therefore have an impact in the short term but also in the longer term if it allows, as we believe, to keep the children who benefit from the school program. From a budgetary point of view, the government could reallocate funds from the unused budgets of some of these programs during the lockdown (from March to June).",

In the urban area, the workers are generally active in the private sector and especially in the informal sector. They obtain their income from activities that were negatively impacted by the cessation of economic activities or by the lockdown. Therefore, we observe a general deterioration in the population\u2019s standard of living as measured by average household expenditure <i>per capita</i>, although the decline is very slight for the top 5% of the distribution.

Thus, the pandemic would have driven nearly additional 96,000 children under the age of 5 into poverty in the rural area. For group 5 to 18, nearly 200,000 individuals living in the rural area are poor, whereas they were not poor in 2019.

However, our complementary measures (scenario 2) targeting rural households with a cash transfer to compensate parents for the loss of education-related assistance and the additional costs of children not attending school since mid-March results in a larger decline in poverty among rural children. As a result, the increase in poverty among children under 18 is reduced by almost 60% because of complementary measures.",

When we distinguish the effects of the measures by area of residence and age group, we find positive effects in both areas and for all age groups.

This could be explained by the fact that Moroccans living in rural areas do not benefit from the complementary transfers that we designed. Finally, the contribution of school aid is positive for both groups (urban and rural), but with a greater contribution to poverty reduction in rural areas since this measure essentially targets this poor population.",

A final difference that we observe when we target children is that the contribution of school aid to reducing poverty and inequality is stronger in rural areas than in urban areas, but it remains below the contribution we obtained when we considered the entire Moroccan population. Thus, even though the measure targets children between the ages of 5 and 17, the effects of this measure are felt by the households in which these children live.",

The total cost of this measure amounts to 20.62 million Dirhams, or 0.58 MAD per Moroccan and 2.12 MAD per beneficiary of the measure. This measure, which targets children, would cost almost 100 MAD (94.18 MAD) per child lifted out of poverty by scenario 2. As these programs are mainly implemented in rural areas, more than 71% of the cost of this measure is allocated to them.

Our results clearly show that the crisis has led to a fairly significant increase in poverty, with more pronounced effects in the urban area. When we broaden our analysis in terms of vulnerability, we observe that even though before the pandemic, more rural households were vulnerable, COVID-19 had a greater impact on urban households.

In addition, as a result of these measures, the number of vulnerable rural people has decreased in both rural and urban areas. However, the two scenarios do not compensate for the shock of the pandemic in the urban area as opposed to the rural area. When we focus our analysis by age category, the incidence rates of vulnerability decrease to their initial rates for children under 5 years of age and decrease very slightly for youth aged 5 to 17 years at the national level.
