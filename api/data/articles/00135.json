                "text": "Tillage farmers must manage numerous economic risks including uncertain yields and prices. Despite the presence of government payments, these factors can generate a relatively high variability in farm income. The improved management of farm income variability can contribute towards stability in household consumption, support for farm investments, further investment in child education and a reduction in the mental stress associated with variable incomes. In this paper, we develop a new farm-level stochastic microsimulation model to simulate the degree of risk attached to the production of Ireland\u2019s main tillage grain crop i.e. spring barley for animal feed usage. Forward contracting is the main available risk management tool for Irish tillage farmers. Our microsimulation model is extended in order to estimate the impact of forward contracting on farm income risk. Our results show that forward contracting can reduce farm income risk significantly but that other stable sources of income are probably necessary to contain the exposure to the income risk attached to cereal production. The model is capable of addressing the income risk associated with multiple crops although this version of the model is confined to one particular crop. The model can be further extended to accommodate other risk management tools such as crop insurance or a farm management deposit scheme. This will allow policymakers, farmers and other interested parties to assess the impact of alternative risk management policies on the heterogeneous pool of Irish tillage farmers.",

Microsimulation models have much in common with traditional farm simulation models as both are frequently used to simulate policy and economic change although the biological component of farm level models makes them somewhat distinct (<a href=\"#bib45\">Richardson <i>et al</i>. 2014</a>). In this paper, we introduce a stochastic farm-level microsimulation model with the objective of estimating the degree of income risk associated with tillage production on Irish farms. The model is extended further to examine the direct impact of forward selling a fixed proportion of cereal output on the variability of profit margins. This is the first attempt in the microsimulation literature to analyse the contribution of forward contracts or other financial risk management tools towards the containment of risk in agriculture.",

Despite the presence of government payments, the risks associated with uncertain yields (production risk) and prices for individual crops (market risk) can be sufficient to generate unusually high income variability. Numerous studies have examined the role of these two variables in influencing income variability (e.g. <a href=\"#bib9\">Coble <i>et al</i>. 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Goodwin and Ker 2002</a>).",

There is a clear absence of empirical analysis regarding the economic impact of income risk and risk management tools for the main grain crops in Irish agriculture.

For Irish farmers, the intervention prices determined a large share of total government payments until the MacSharry reforms and the introduction of direct payments in 1992/1993 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hennessy <i>et al</i>. 2014</a>). Sckokai and Moro (2009) explain that the MacSharry reforms were only partially decoupled from production given their connection with \u201cdecisions through the land allocation mechanism\u201d.

It may be the case that some farmers respond to poor yield outcomes by ceasing the production of spring barley and we should consider this in any assessment of the model results. For the selected sample, the average number of hectares of spring barley production appears quite low at approximately 10.45 hectares. This is due to the fact that some of these farms will have recorded years without production of spring barley for animal feed. A substantial proportion of activity on many of these farms is allocated to livestock production. For instance, among the selected sample, an average of approximately 38.5 hectares is devoted to livestock production. This exceeds the average number of hectares allocated to tillage production. A relatively small proportion (~ six per cent) of the selected sample is engaged in specialist dairy farming.

The average age of the farm operator is also higher among the selected sample which may have some effect on risk management decision-making. The differences in sample characteristics mean that we should be careful in interpreting the results.

At this time, the Teagasc outlook indicated a deterministic projection of approximately 160 euro per tonne for Winter Wheat. The outlook did not explicitly provide a deterministic estimate for Spring Barley prices. However, the Spring Barley price typically follows the trend in Winter Wheat prices albeit at a slightly lower level. For 2014, this would have suggested a deterministic projection in the region of 150 to 160 euro per tonne (<a href=\"#bib50\">Thorne 2013</a>). The regression based model should ideally provide a deterministic value in this region for 2014.",

In the presence of future prices, one could simply assume that the futures price at any given time represents the best available guide to the predicted price for the crop at harvest time. In contrast to malted barley, there are limited futures markets for spring barley for animal feed usage although such markets do exist in Australia and Hungary. In the United Kingdom, there does exist a LIFFE feed wheat futures market and this can often prove to be a useful guide to the future feed barley price given the expected high correlation between both feed wheat and feed barley prices.

The risk of the barley being rejected by potential buyers on the basis of poor quality is a risk that is very relevant for both producers of barley for malting purposes and barley for animal feed usage. For instance, a farmer may intend to grow barley for sale as malting barley but it may be rejected by potential buyers and the farmer will therefore resort to selling the barley as animal feed or alternatively using the barley to feed their own livestock. Our data suggests that the vast majority of malting barley producers have at some point classified a proportion of their barley production as barley for animal feed usage although it is not clear if this is a result of quality issues or something more deliberate.<sup><a href=\"#fn4\">4</a></sup>",

For producers of spring barley for animal feed usage, the alternatives are much less rewarding as a failure to meet quality standards is likely to imply a zero payoff. On the other hand, the standards associated with quality acceptance for barley for animal feed usage are lower than for malting barley and ceteris paribus the likelihood of rejection is likely to be lower as a result.",

We therefore show the profit impact of forward contract adoption under a situation where the farmer enters into a contract at 150 euro per tonne and therefore slightly below the expected price of 157 euro per tonne.

On the y-axis lies the cumulative distribution with the value one representing the entire 138 farms. This provides some indication about the differences between farms in crop yield variability. One can see from <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> that the coefficient of variation is approximately 12 to 14 per cent for the median farm i.e. the 69th highest value for income variability in the sample. This suggests that the variability in crop yields tends to be lower than the variability in output prices, a finding similar to (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nayak &amp; Turvey 2000</a>) but we should exercise some caution in the interpretation given that the yields are given at the individual farm level while the crop prices are aggregate indicators. <a href=\"#bib32\">Kimura and LeThi (2011)</a> explain that aggregated data can underestimate the risk for a particular variable. There are a minority of cases where the simulated crop yield variability is in excess of twenty per cent. In these cases, the simulated degree of variability in crop yields is likely to exceed the output price variability. Conversely, there are a significant minority of farms (~15 per cent) with relatively low crop yield variability of less than eight per cent.",

Farmers will need to establish their own stochastic budgets before considering the forward contracting tool. As in the case of other European farmers, the Irish tillage farmers could benefit from a wider range of available risk management tools. This may include tools capable of giving better protection from adverse changes to the gross margin than is available under a forward contract. Demand for these tools may well be influenced by the degree of dependency on the single farm payment. Future work will incorporate the role of the single farm payments and off-farm work in stabilising household income particularly for these less cost competitive tillage producers. The model can be developed further to examine the potential effect of other risk management tools on income risk including a farm management deposit scheme or gross margin insurance.",

The findings from this research can facilitate more effective policy design and implementation in this regard. Our results confirm the important role of decoupled direct payments in insulating farmers\u2019 incomes against risk. However, our findings also indicate that income variability has increased in recent years and hence the need for risk management tools. We find that forward contracting can be an effective means of reducing farmers\u2019 exposure to income variability. Whilst forward contracting is not a policy tool, there is a role for policy makers in relation to education and promotion and in the provision of timely, accessible market information, similar to the data provided in the Milk Market Observatory, co-ordinated by the European Commission. Furthermore, our research has examined the relative contribution of price and yield to margin volatility thus providing policy makers with useful information on the source of risk which can support the design of more effective policies, such as the income stabilisation tool for example. Whilst, this paper did not specifically examine the impact of the income stabilisation tool, the modelling infrastructure built as part of this paper could be used in future work to examine this research question.",
