In response to the emerging labour shortages and their wider impacts on the economy, the Australian government, like other national governments who are facing the similar pressures (<a href=\"#bib22\">Meyhew &amp; Rijkers 2004</a>), promoted deferred or gradual retirement as a way of combating future labour shortages and increasing taxation revenue to support an ageing population (<a href=\"#bib19\">Howard 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Costello 2005</a>).",

Labour shortages are now becoming a priority for government, not just unemployment.

This is surprising given that a number of studies have concluded that indirect costs are, for a number of conditions, greater than the direct costs to the health system (<a href=\"#bib9\">Begley, Annegers et al. 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Taylor, Pezzullo et al. 2006</a>).",

For example, estimates of lost income have assumed that all persons included in the study would, without illness, have achieved average earnings and paid an average amount of tax (<a href=\"#bib1\">Access Economics 2005</a>). This generalisation does not take into account evidence that both income and type of illness differ by age, sex, education and occupation. For example, a higher degree is related to 100% higher earnings in later working life (<a href=\"#bib20\">Johnson &amp; Lloyd 2000</a>). In addition, the estimates are based at a single point in time, and as there is no age distribution underlying the data, there has been no capacity to estimate the accumulated lost earnings or wealth accumulation from retirement through to traditional retirement age or losses from the retirement income stream. A further limitation of these types of studies is that there is no distributional information about the extent of incapacity and therefore it is difficult to estimate the probability of intervention leading to potential workforce participation.",

It is not possible to exactly match individuals between STINMOD and the SDAC for a number of reasons. Both are based on survey information and there will be few respondents in common on both data sources. Further, the data was collected at different points in time, meaning that even for the few individuals that may be in common, some variables will no longer be the same between the SDAC and the surveys underpinning STINMOD, or will have changed due to the ageing and uprating process which ages STINMOD data to 2009 e.g. age, income, labour force status and income unit type. Finally, within Australia, exact matching between ABS surveys is prohibited. As a result of these constraints, income and wealth information was imputed onto the base population of Health&amp;WealthMOD (Version II) by synthetically identifying persons with similar characteristics on STINMOD and \u201cdonating\u201d their income, tax and wealth information onto Health&amp;WealthMOD (Version II).",

Separate regression models were fitted with one matching variable as a predictor in each model and the R<sup>2</sup> of each model was noted. The records in each cell were further grouped into homogeneous cells based on the matching variable that explained the highest variation in income.

The number of additional persons in the labour force each year is then calculated by applying age group specific differences in the probability of labour force participation of those without a disease and of those with the disease to the extra number of disease-free persons of the same age group. The total extra person years in the labour force for each cohort can then multiplied by the adjusted difference in median incomes of those who were in the labour force and had no disease, and of those who were not in the labour force and had the disease to estimate the additional income that would have been accumulated by each cohort over the time period of the intervention.
