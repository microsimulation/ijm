This system is part of a broader portfolio of predictive models managed by the Research Department. While some models are used by personnel at the Ministry of Finance, others are operated directly by Statistics Norway.

On the contrary, they made it clear that they wanted more simulation results. In fact, they clearly stated that they would like to be presented with simulation results year-round, not only in the period after the budget comes out. It is not a bad thing that our services are in great demand, but the main challenge now is figuring out how we can provide policymakers with as many simulation results as they want without compromising accuracy and reliability. At present, as we reprogram the model in a new language, transitioning from SAS to R, we are certainly bearing these comments in minds.",

This brings me to another module of the LOTTE model system \u2013 the labor supply module LOTTE-Arbeid. Given the complex nature of structural labor supply modeling, one might wonder if the team has the right mix of expertise to both support policymakers and develop advanced modeling tools. In our microsimulation work at Statistics Norway we have been fortunate enough to have John K. Dagsvik in our team. He is a top expert on stochastic modeling and discrete choice analysis, and his expertise has been invaluable in the development of LOTTE-Arbeid. Having him closely involved with the models has greatly benefited our research group. While the results of LOTTE-Arbeid have been presented in Norwegian budget proposals, John\u2019s foundational work on the model concept underlying LOTTE-Arbeid has been published in prestigious journals such as <i>Review of Economic Studies</i>, <i>Journal of Applied Econometrics</i>, <i>International Economic Review</i>, and <i>Econometrica</i>.",

Building modular and open-source tools, Ghenis and Woodruff aim to make it easier for other researchers and policymakers to use and adapt their models.

Eric\u2019s contribution to this special issue is based on his keynote presentation, entitled \u201cThe use of tax-benefit simulation models to inform policymaking in the United States.\u201d Unknown to Eric, I have been an admirer of his work for quite some time \u2013 ever since I read his 1994 paper, \u201cTrends in Federal Tax Progressivity,\u201d co-authored with Richard Kasten and Frank Sammartino, in a book edited by Joel Slemrod <a href=\"#bib1\">(Kasten et al., 1994)</a>. I still have a physical copy of this book chapter on my shelf, although it has become well-worn from frequent reading. It is an elegant demonstration of how powerful microsimulation can be in terms of measuring tax progressivity or tax redistribution over time. In a paper by Peter Lambert and myself <a href=\"#bib2\">(Lambert and Thoresen, 2009)</a>, we attribute the \u201cfixed-income\u201d approach to Eric and his co-authors. This approach to analyzing tax progressivity over time involves holding pretax income distributions constant, selecting a base year, and applying taxation according to the various tax schemes of the period. This is a powerful tool for identifying the effects of tax policy change on redistribution which we have used to inform the Norwegian debate on several occasions. Peter and I discuss an alternative approach too, but that is another story.",

I am particularly intrigued by his discussion of the relationship between microsimulation and macro models. Given the significance of \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d in US policy debates, it is fascinating to see how these models are used interchangeably to offer insights into the effects over various time horizons. Conventional estimates of proposed tax and spending legislation take account of various behavioral responses by individual and corporate taxpayers to changes in tax law, but the gross national product (GNP) is fixed. Then dynamic scoring models estimate the effects of changes in tax laws on macroeconomic aggregates such as GDP, labor supply, investment, and interest rates in the short and long run. Microsimulation models of households are used to estimate the effects of policy changes on average and marginal tax rates. These are then fed into the macro model to estimate changes in economic aggregates. These changes are then fed back into the microsimulation models to estimate the feedback effects on revenue.",

This paper demonstrates how microsimulation models can be used in the discussion of an extremely important policy issue, namely how financial work incentives are affected when unemployment benefits depend on previous earnings. The authors explore implications of strengthening the link between unemployment benefits and previous earnings by using the tax and benefit microsimulation model SWITCH (based on EUROMOD) developed by the Irish Economic and Social Research Institute.",

While I have previously (see above) emphasized how advances in structural labor supply modeling have enriched our work with the LOTTE microsimulation models, this paper highlights an alternative approach to incorporating behavioral effects such as labor supply effects. The paper demonstrates how the practitioner can employ exogeneously given response estimates to account for behavioral effects in this type of work, referred to as a \u201creduced form\u201d approach. As it might be demanding to establish a fully-fledged labor supply module based on the estimation and application of a structural model, the study demonstrates how behavioral effects may be accounted for in microsimulation in a simpler and more practical way.",

Since the reform primarily focuses on raising unemployment benefits, the adjustment is modeled in terms of reduced unemployment durations.
