It highlights the expanding breadth of the field, both in terms of the number of countries and in terms of the broadening policy area. It also outlines concerns in relation to lack of emphasis historically in relation to the transmission of codified and in the sometimes proprietary ownership model. Moving forward, an improved focus on the codification and peer review of methodologies used in the field is suggested. In terms of tacit knowledge transmission, the organisation of more regional meetings of the International Microsimulation Association is encouraged. In terms of future areas for model development, the opportunities are to incorporate behaviour to a greater extent, utilise more data in the big data revolution, to increase the field of microsimulation into new policy areas, and to share code and work in networks. Finally, the role of peer review is highlighted.",

For one, it opens a discussion on whether the data in the starting dataset need to be imputed. If not, then the model needs to take these missing values into account. Furthermore, even more compared to cell-based models, there is not much reason to assume that the results of reduced-form behavioural equations will yield intertemporal stable results, and if they do not, then a lot of tweaking is required. Furthermore, the dynamic element makes micro-macro iterations considerably harder, at least in the types of models that are \u201cfull dynamic\u201d, that is other than models that apply static ageing techniques. Finally, for modelling purposes, one needs not only to become credible cross-sectional results but also longitudinal results. For this, both the incidence and prevalence levels, as well as durations need to be considered, while at the same time preventing some impossible transitions.",

Building on the work by, among others, the DYNACAN team, one might argue that quite some work has been done in that area. As <a href=\"#bib17\">Dekkers <i>et al</i>. (2010a)</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">Dekkers, Desmet, R\u00e9zmovits, Sundberg, &amp; T\u00f3th (2015)</a> and <a href=\"#bib20\">Dekkers, Conti, Desmet, Sundberg, &amp; Van den Bosch (2018)</a> show, various dynamic microsimulation models are now capable to work in parallel with macro models. Furthermore, on a more technical level, many tools and techniques that previously were model-bound are now available through open-source toolkits such as Modgen, JAMSIM, JAS-mine and LIAM2. See <a href=\"#bib14\">De Menten, Dekkers, Bryon, Li\u00e9geois, &amp; O\u2019Donoghue (2014)</a> for a discussion.",

One of the problems, he noted, was that \u201cthe empirical grounding of many of the agent-based models is still a ways off\u2019. This is no longer the case today. ABMs are becoming more empirically-driven, and increasing numbers of ABM papers are being presented at International Microsimulation Association (IMA) congresses. The 2018 Asia-Pacific regional conference of IMA is a case in point; it was organised jointly with the 10th International Workshop on Agent-based Approach in Economic and Social Complex Systems. This collaborative effort between IMA and the Pan-Asian Association for Agent-Based Approach in Social Systems Sciences (PAAA) will hopefully add to the increasing overlap between the two fields. An application which appears especially promising is the use of ABM-approaches to underpin the behavioural elements of dynamic microsimulation models (<a href=\"#bib59\">Richiardi, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Van de Ven, 2017</a>).",

The first of these key points is the development of health microsimulation. This was a young but growing field at that time, and it is an important and still growing field for microsimulation today. For example, health microsimulation is now a standard session subject at the microsimulation (MSM) conferences, such as in Luxembourg (2015), Budapest (2016), and Turin (2017). However, when it comes to dynamic microsimulation, the number of specific models remains limited and it is \u201cmore common to see health modules \u2018bolted to\u2019 dynamic models primarily developed to project demographic change\u201d (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schofield, Carter, &amp; Edwards, 2014</a>, p. 422). One might wonder whether this is such a major problem in that it would mean that a general multi-purpose dynamic model could be used for research in various fields, such as retirement, health and education. This then of course requires that the various teams have access to this base model. This is a problem this paper will get back to later.",

In particular does he refer here to the system of System of Social and Demographic Statistics (SDSS). Although this discussion is now largely past us, the discussion on what indicators dynamic microsimulation models can provide is still as relevant as it was before. Dynamic life-expectancy tables, gender pension gaps, redistributive consequences of selective mating, impact of pension system characteristics and labour market decisions, developments in educational attainment levels, health indicators; the list goes on. A recent development that might be rooted in the discussion on the SSDS in the late 1970s is that of the accrued-to-date-liabilities (ADL) in Europe. These are \u201cthe pension entitlements accrued by current workers (including deferred pension entitlements) and the remaining pension entitlements of existing pensioners\u201d (<a href=\"#bib29\">Eurostat/European Central Bank, 2011</a>, p. 16, Box 1). This is a concept of pension obligations that \u201cprovide an estimate of the cost of a hypothetical termination of a pension scheme without reneging on accrued entitlements\u201d (op. cit Box 2, p. 18). Thus, pension rights accrued in future years are not taken into account. ADLs are being simulated by using dynamic microsimulation models in several countries, including France (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blanchet, Le Minez, &amp; Marino, 2015</a>), Estonia (<a href=\"#bib55\">Praxis, 2016</a>) and Belgium (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brys, 2017</a>).",

Where it exists it is published in non-peer reviewed technical papers (<a href=\"#bib2\">B\u00e6kgaard, 2002</a>) as team specific internal documentation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Johnson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Morrison, 2006</a>), conference papers (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ch\u00e9nard, 2000a</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kelly &amp; Percival, 2009</a>) or in relatively hard to find volumes based on conferences (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ch\u00e9nard, 2000b</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Neufeld, 2000</a>). It should be noted that all these references date from the 2000s. As said, furthermore, most are not peer reviewed and often are hard to find, also because the teams that produced them have since then dissolved.

(2008</a>, in <a href=\"#bib33\">Harron <i>et al</i>. 2017</a>) mention large sample sizes, detailed data on hard-to-reach populations, for generating results with a high degree of external validity, and application for policy making. Additional advantages of administrative data include that the definition of the variables is grounded in legal concepts and do not depend on self-assessment by the respondents. Increasingly this data is becoming accessible to the scientific community (<a href=\"#bib48\">OPRE, 2016</a>) although differences remain (<a href=\"#bib11\">Connelly, Playford, Gayle, &amp; Dibben, 2016</a>). Of course administrative data is by definition secondary data, and some aspects therefore are not covered. Traditional examples of this are educational attainment levels and training, and the composition of the social household beyond the fiscal unit. In some countries and years, this information is found by combining administrative data with Census data or Labour Force Surveys, but in other cases this information is lacking. Also, information on frontier workers and on informal money transfers is for obvious reasons often only partially available. Furthermore, administrative data is of course not collected in one go, but rather consists of linked datasets gathered for different and specific purposes. Not all fields of life are covered by this data in the same level of detail, and missing data and linkage issues may remain a problem (<a href=\"#bib33\">Harron <i>et al</i>., 2017</a>). Administrative data has the potential to change social sciences, and especially our particular field of interest. It especially makes the above discussion on the sharing of code all the more relevant, because of the possibilities it offers for reproducible research (<a href=\"#bib11\">Connelly <i>et al</i>., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Playford, Gayle, Connelly, &amp; Gray, 2016</a>).",

This might explain why in the European member states many dynamic microsimulation models that use administrative data can be found in the public sector (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dekkers &amp; Van den Bosch, 2016</a>). Furthermore, the recent EU General Data Protection Regulation (<a href=\"#bib30\">GDPR Portal, 2018</a>) might have an important impact on the accessibility of individual data for research purposes. Finally, where administrative data is increasingly available with the above caveats, availability of survey data, especially panel data, is in Europe poorer now than in the 1990s with the demise of the European Community Household Panel.",

In terms of behaviour, the lack of behaviour based upon rigorous economic and social science theory is still a frequent criticism and where there is behaviour, there could be an improved focus on causality even if much of existing econometric literature is difficult to extrapolate into a full population policy setting. Ways to go forward include the full-integrated modelling of behaviour in the dynamic life-cycle model, for example, as in the model SIDD (<a href=\"#bib66\">Van de Ven, 2016</a>, <a href=\"#bib67\">2017</a>). This, however, makes the model very complex and inflexible. Furthermore, combinations with alignment are to our knowledge not possible. An alternative could be to include a \u201ctraditional\u201d one-period labour supply model in the dynamic microsimulation model (such as <a href=\"#bib21\">Dekkers, Decoster, &amp; Cap\u00e9au, 2014</a>). The problem with this approach is that the decision is made again each period and independently from decisions in previous periods, or expectations on the future. A third and promising approach is the combination of dynamic microsimulation and ABM (<a href=\"#bib59\">Richiardi, 2013</a>). In terms of access to data, the challenge remains in how to channel the huge datasets that are becoming available in this era of big data and the potential that cloud computing has in analysing and microsimulating with this data.

This process helps to provide quality as it requires the research or analysis to meet the standards of peers. The usefulness of the research to peers, its significance and status after publication then depends upon the number of citations of work. However within this field, we often ignore the mechanics of this process either by publishing papers as conference papers without peer review and when citing research literature in our own papers, citing working papers. Doing this both lessens the quality assurance process, even if the quality is high and reduces the capacity of performance metrics to attribute significance to the work undertaken. By using this approach, we collectively as a field reduce our visible impact to the wider world, which in turn has implications for research funding prioritisation and the attractiveness of the field to new researchers.",

The impact factor of the Journal is important for researchers in terms of types of journals to target. The relatively new journal is now in in the top third of Repec rankings with an Impact Factor of 2.1 and is ranked ahead of many competitor journals for those who work in the area. Further, increasing the impact factor of our journal is a specific goal for our field. We want to have papers that are of relevance to our members and stakeholders. However in only publishing and citing working papers instead of peer reviewed articles, we undermine the real impact factor associated with research in the field. We should try to cite IJM articles rather than working papers. We should also think about submitting our working and technical papers for peer review, rather than seeing these non-peer reviewed papers as the end in itself. Given the very fast turnaround time of the journal publishing first in the IJM is viable opportunity rather than publishing as a working paper without compromising the capacity to get citable work into the public domain quickly.",

Its role in providing quality assurance to new models and analyses in the sector is important for wider quality assurance in the sector. Indeed, submitting our working and technical papers for peer review, as we previously called for, might not necessarily add much to the impact factor of our journal, since these technical papers will only be cited by other model developers and not by those from the outside that use and interpret the results of our work. However, if we were to focus solely on improving the Impact Factor, we would probably exclude these less novel papers.

The association therefore decided to establish regional meetings. The first of these were organised in Europe (Hungary, 2016) the US (Washington, 2016) and Japan (Narita, 2018).
