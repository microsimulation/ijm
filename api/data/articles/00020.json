These micro techniques cannot assess the poverty and income distribution effects of macroeconomic policies of the type mentioned above (trade reform, trade liberalization, exchange and interest rates interventions, composition of public spending, etc.) because the policy reform affects the whole economy where, to different degrees, all agents are simultaneously subject to a \u2018treatment\u2019, to use the evaluation literature terminology.",

In all these cases, generating treatment and control groups means generating a macro counterfactual that permits to figure out what the economy would have looked like if macro policy changes (or indirect macro consequences) had been absent, and how it compared with the actual situation where macro effects are present.",

It is well known, for example, that aggregate growth effects of trade liberalization tend to be positive but small and, at least in the short run, redistributive effects are much larger. It is also often the case that losers tend to be concentrated in small and vocal groups whereas winners are dispersed and seldom represented by strong lobbies. Being able to precisely identify and measure these distributive effects \u2013 both ex ante, i.e. before implementing the reform, or ex-post \u2013 is crucial to respond to often inflated complaints about negative effects and to design complementary policies to compensate those suffering losses.

This expansion\u2019s effects on government budget, on the countercyclical nature of the fiscal stance, on relative prices, and its other macro effects need to be evaluated to ensure its sustainability and effectiveness.

In most cases, the macro part of the framework uses, at different degrees of aggregation, data from the National Accounts and the micro part employs data from household or labour surveys. A degree of consistency between these macro and micro datasets is required and thus tested during the construction of this type of models. Statistical agencies have almost universally adopted common standards for collecting and assembling national accounts and ancillary macro data (balance of payments, trade flows, government accounts) and most of these agencies have also developed a good track record in the collection of micro data: household and firm surveys. However, systematic consistency checks between these datasets are almost never pursued. A reconciliation of the same aggregate variable, such as aggregate private consumption for example, from the two sources should be attempted and the cause of the discrepancy uncovered. By allowing a more precise monitoring of the economy, this reconciliation can improve policy making. Bourguignon <i>et al</i>.

In a <i>second</i> step, counterfactual values for a subset of CGE variables are exported to the micro data base which is then being modified so as to be consistent with these values. In other words, the microsimulation model has to generate a solution that is consistent, when aggregating micro unites, with the counterfactual macro variables. The subset of aggregate variables linking the CGE and the microsimulation models normally includes the main determinants of poverty and distribution: wage rates by type of worker, employment by type of worker and sector, unemployment, consumption quantities and prices by category of goods and services. The microsimulated household level data can then be used to construct a new income distribution that is consistent with the new macro equilibrium in terms of those variables and that can be compared with the initial income distribution to estimate changes in poverty and inequality. These types of sequential macro-micro models are also labelled top-down models, indicating the uni-directional link from the macro (top) to the micro (bottom) parts.",

Price changes are easily implemented in the micro data base, assuming no behavioural change. We know that the change in the income of a household minus the change in its consumption spending gives a first approximation of its change in \u2018welfare\u2019. Things are less easy with employment changes implied by the macro model. In the paper by Vos and S\u00e1nchez a statistical rule is used to adjust the micro data to the new equilibrium by simply reweighing the observations belonging to the various employment groups (this is also sometimes called the \u2018non-parametric approach). Clearly, this is equivalent to assuming that the policy reform being studied changes employment groups by drawing randomly from those groups that are shrinking and adding randomly to those groups that are expanding. On the contrary, the second contribution by Lay uses a \u2018behavioural\u2019 microsimulation model where individuals and households respond to the macro shock according to some parameterized behavioural functions that represent the way in which people with different characteristics are allocated to different employment groups. This time the reallocation of people across employment groups due to some policy reform is not done randomly any more. Finally, H\u00e9rault\u2019s paper provides a comparison of these approaches using both behavioural and non-behavioural micro-simulation techniques.",

The microsimulation methodology, used by these authors is adapted from <a href=\"#bib1\">Almeida dos Reis and Paes de Barros (1991)</a>, where the functioning of the labour market behaviour is mimicked by a random selection procedure in a segmented labour market context. Individuals move randomly across labour market segments \u2013 for example, between unemployment and employment, between wage and non-wage employment, between agriculture and non-agriculture \u2013 depending on changes in aggregate labour market conditions. These movements or \u201cassignments\u201d continue until the cumulative change in the occupational status of individuals matches the new labour market conditions generated by the CGE counterfactual. Given the complexities in adequately modelling the working of the labour market empirically, Vos and S\u00e1nchez argue that the probability that one rather than another individual changes employment status may just as well be approximated by a <i>randomized process</i>.

The core of the microsimulation is a household income generation model estimated from household survey data with individual-level employment information. Following Bourguignon <i>et al</i>. (<a href=\"#bib4\">2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2002</a>), two components are included in the household income generation model: an occupational choice and an earnings model. In the choice model, individual agents first choose between different occupational choices (such as, for example, unemployment, wage-employment and self-employment) based on econometrically-estimated occupational choice models. Then earnings are generated according to estimated wage or profit functions. In a typical run of this macro-micro model, once the CGE model has generated simulated new equilibrium employment and average earnings values, individual earnings and occupational choices are changed in the micro-simulation model. This can be done in various ways but one is simpler and more appealing than others. It consists of varying the constants in the estimated occupational functions in the microsimulation model, which is equivalent to having people with the least a priori probability to be in a given employment group moving first out of their groups.",

The call of when a small bias becomes large is left to the researcher, but H\u00e9rault stresses what we mentioned already, namely that with the behavioural approach all changes in occupational choices and earnings are traceable at the individual level and linked to certain characteristics of the individual or household thus allowing the design of behaviour-related complementary policies.",

When aggregation conditions do not hold, macro models or models with representative agents do not necessarily tell the whole story and, in particular, miss out on some important interactions between distribution and growth. The solution proposed by Savard is to estimate the aggregation error by using a behavioural micro simulation model in the following way. Initially the macro model simulates a shock and this is passed onto the microsimulation model in terms of price and employments shocks. These shocks are then fed into the micro model to recalculate occupational status and incomes. The difference between the values derived from aggregating the micro data after the shock and the initially simulated values of the CGE is assumed to represent the aggregation error. This is then used as an additional shock and introduced into the CGE model. In turn, this produces a second macro simulation which is passed to the microsimulation. Iteratively, the aggregation error should converge to zero and the process ends.",

The size of the aggregation error is an empirical issue but on pure theoretical grounds accounting for it in these cases is justifiable. However, a cleaner theoretical model comes with some cost.

This paper\u2019s main contribution is its attempt to integrate long term growth and distribution issues in a macro-micro global model. This Global Income Distribution Dynamics (GIDD) model described in this paper introduces some important new features. First, by including 121 countries and covering 90 per cent of the world population, it is the first <i>global</i> macro-micro simulation model. This extensive coverage allows the GIDD to address questions that would not be tractable with other methods. For example, GIDD can assess growth and distribution effects of <i>global</i> policies such as multilateral trade liberalization or mitigation of climate change damages, among others. The global nature of the modelling framework makes it possible to decompose inequality dynamics into a component due to changes in average income between countries and a component due to widening disparities within countries. A second important novelty is that GIDD explicitly considers long term time horizons in which changes in the demographic structure may become crucial components of both growth and distribution dynamics. The explicit <i>long-term</i> focus of the GIDD can capture the impacts of aging and other demographic changes, such as the skill composition of a population, which may become crucial components of both growth and distribution dynamics.",

In Cockburn, Corong, Decaluw\u00e9, Fofana and Robichaud a sequential dynamic CGE model with various growth channels is linked to a non-behavioural microsimulation model to study the poverty and distributional impacts of trade-mandated changes in growth for the case of Senegal.

A growing literature on the inequality of opportunity (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bourguignon <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Roemer 1998</a>) is providing strong evidence on some of the causes of inequality traps and possibly on how to devise efficient redistributions.

Firms are at least as heterogeneous as households, they unequally benefit from policy reforms and they play a key role in labour market outcomes which in turn affect household welfare.

Many applied models of developing economies, whether pure CGE or macro-micro tend to consider public spending as a black box and ignores its direct effects on factor supply, output and income distribution. Efforts are needed to integrate some key components of public spending in the modelling of growth and distribution. A clear example is public spending on education. This seems an obvious mechanism to remedy inequality in the distribution of opportunities and one that could have accelerate growth. The cross country growth literature of the 1990 has tried to explicitly take these effects into account but the reliability and detailed policy relevance of this literature has been questioned. An example of a structural model in which the growth and the general equilibrium effects of public expenditure programs are accounted for is given by the MAMS model described in <a href=\"#bib8\">Bourguignon <i>et al</i>.
