                "text": "The Swedish micro to macro model MOSES is presented in terms of original technical publications and early empirical studies. It is shown <span class=\"underline\">how</span> autonomous firms form expectations, make up plans, set prices, and revise plans after having been confronted with other firms\u2019 plans in product, labor, and financial markets, and <span class=\"underline\">how</span> all market agents together <i>endogenously self-coordinate the macro economy,</i> and keep it evolving over time. Agents <i>learn</i> from their expectational mistakes to improve next period anticipations and plans. Combined with endogenous <i>Schumpeterian entrepreneurs</i> that enter markets unexpectedly, this unique <i>Stockholm School feature</i> confers radically new dynamic properties to the macro economy. Entrepreneurial entry not only subjects the model economy to a constantly ongoing Creative Destruction process (endogenous structural change), but also keeps incumbent firms under constant competitive pressure that forces them to <i>innovate preemptively</i>, not to be competed out of the market (<i>exit</i>), and thus propels the economy forward in time, leaving in its wake an endogenous population of firms. A master version of the MOSES model has been calibrated to represent a <i>Sweden like advanced industrial economy</i>. The selection of publications also demonstrates how the <i>modular design</i> of the model has been gradually expanded, around its original dynamic market module, to become a model approximation of what I call an <i>Experimentally Organized Economy</i> (EOE) in which decisions of <i>boundedly rational</i> agents <i>become economic experiments to be tested in markets</i>. In fact, the model economy can even be used by boundedly rational policy makers, who should not conduct experiments, but fortunately can learn about the limits of their policy ambitions by practicing on the MOSES model.",

The Model of the Swedish Economic System (read MOSES) is still alive and empirically implemented, with somewhat moderated ambitions, however, but prepared for further extensions (Section 6). Empirical economy wide modelling is resource demanding, and the model needed a solid theoretical foundation to explain its unfamiliar systems behavior. The nature and full scale of all this was of course not fully appreciated at the start. The publications in this anthology, including references to easily available journal articles, have therefore been selected to give the MOSES model both a defined place in the theoretical environment of received economic doctrines, and an account of the practical hurdles that have had to be overcome during its now (2024) fifty-year history to keep the model alive and in working condition. The publications also demonstrate how <i>the micro simulation method, using numerical computer simulation mathematics, can both help advance general economic theorizing, and make quantitative micro market-based economy wide analysis possible, in effect achieving a natural integration of theory and empirical method</i>. An extra effort has been devoted to explaining how endogenous <i>and resource using markets self-organize the economy, when processing the information and exercising the competition that govern the allocation of resources</i> that propels the model economy over the longer term, together being a unique signum of the MOSES modelling method. I show how the integration of at least six familiar models associated with Keynes, Leontief, Marshall, Schumpeter, Simon and the Stockholm School economists, including Knut Wicksell, helps minimize the <i>partiality predicament of economic theorizing</i>, and clarify that economics is not a business for specialists. Sections 1 and 2 are therefore a theoretical introduction devoted to the study, in selected publications, of the properties of the model economy, or for short, establishing both the empirical relevance and the theoretical foundation of the <i>artificial reality</i> of the MOSES model economy.",

Consequently, <i>increased market flexibility often comes out as preferred policy to regulation and parameter manipulation based on forecasts by boundedly rational policy makers</i>. Such comparisons are of course not possible if the model has no micro agents, no explicit markets, no Stockholm School feed backs of mistaken expectations to learn from, the latter deficiencies being typical characteristics of the two main fields of economic modeling - macro and general equilibrium economics - and, as it seems, also the emerging field of evolutionary modeling. To rectify this deficiency has provided sufficient incentives for keeping this project alive for fifty years (2024). For this the micro simulation method, including agent-based modeling, has been the right instrumentation, a potential that to my mind has so far not been taken full advantage of (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ballot et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib150\">Pyka and Fagiolo, 2007</a>). Already <a href=\"#bib179\">Koopmans (1957)</a> predicted that computer based simulation mathematics would in the future restore the numerical example as a respectale tool for general economc analys. On this I add that it will above all free the economist of the inhibiting restriction associated with orthodox modelling.We conjecture that a real economy must be even more of a challenge for ambitious policy makers, and that <i>the collective knowledge embodied in market agents and transformed into market action means that increased market flexibility often comes out as preferred policy</i>. The policy maker can in fact profitably learn about the limits of his ambitions, and how to work with, instead of against markets, by practicing on the MOSES model (<a href=\"#bib74\">Eliasson, 1991a</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Eliasson and Taymaz, 1992</a>).",

The MOSES model thus integrates <i>bounded rationality</i> characteristics of agents (<a href=\"#bib160\">Simon, 1955</a>) with the push of <i>entrepreneurial entry</i> (<a href=\"#bib157\">Schumpeter, 1911</a>) that creates a collective competitive force that compells incumbent agents to innovate preemptively, not to be competed out of the market (<a href=\"#bib79\">Eliasson, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Eliasson, 1996</a>). All this dynamic occurs within a complete micro to macro and stock flow consistent Keynesian demand accounting scheme, and a Leontief input output production structure.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> By taking the macro analysis down to the micro market level a theoretical link to ; <a href=\"#bib140\">Marshall (1890)</a> and <a href=\"#bib141\">Marshall (1919)</a>'s concept of <i>industrial districts</i> populated by micro agents is furthermore established. With the entire model economy being <i>self-coordinated by the invisible hand of markets</i>, the MOSES model takes on not only distinctly Adam Smithian qualities, but the dynamics of market selection also creates the positive network productivity externalities that Marshall verbally formulated,<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> but that later became the cornerstone of so-called New Growth theory (<a href=\"#bib153\">Romer, 1986</a>). In the MOSES model, however, network externalities are explicitly created by market induced reallocations of resources among heterogeneous agents, that change the organization of markets (see Section 4.4.4). In fact, one novelty of the MOSES design is that selection of technological innovations driven by entrepreneurial competition, most prominently through the entry and exit of business agents through a Schumpeterian type of creative destruction (see <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>), and competing heterogeneous firms with autonomous price setting capacities together <i>constantly change production structures and make the population of firms endogenous.</i><sup><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup> Therefore, Gerard Ballot and Erol Taymaz could demonstrate how new growth theory type\u201cnetwork externalities\u201d may be created in MOSES markets by firms raiding each other for workers\u2019 skills (see Section 4.4.4).",

Together it all amounts to a gigantic ex ante long run economy wide market self- coordination game propelled forward in time by production agents climbing ex ante profit hills, or if you like, as the entrepreneurial competition driven Schumpeterian Creative Destruction process stylized in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a> and embodied as the driving force in the MOSES model (<a href=\"#bib79\">Eliasson, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Eliasson, 1996</a>). Economic growth occurs if winners dominate over losers in this market game. Since the ex ante profit hills, as perceived by firms, change from period to period, because of all the competitive profit hill climbing going on, these peaks will never be attained. Through innovation nudges and competition markets both govern the allocation of resources, force production agents to innovate, and self-coordinate an economy wide evolution, which rarely comes even close to what may be maximum possible at each point in time. Forcing the model economy closer to such a state by speeding up market competition (through policy) will eventually create increasingly unpredictable markets, raise business planning mistakes, and cause unstable economic systems behavior and perhaps even collapse (<a href=\"#bib74\">Eliasson, 1991a</a>). Stable long run macro growth still, however, requires a significant turnover of firms, a steady churning of microeconomic structures and reallocations of resources over markets. As the publications of this anthology demonstrate, a MOSES type model economy exhibits such dynamic complexity that it is a vain hope for a central coordinator, like the Walrasian auctioneer, to be sufficiently informed to do a better job than the markets (<a href=\"#bib74\">Eliasson, 1991a</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Eliasson and Taymaz, 1992</a>).",

Economy wide market self- <i>equilibration</i> or self-organization in the MOSES model only requires that economic evolution stays within a range bounded from above and does not collapse.

In such a world radically disturbed market environments occur now and then and make neoclassical welfare criteria based on achieving equilibrium states nonsensical. In the real nonlinear world they instead demand of policy makers that they not only understand what kind of disturbance the economy is heading for (a forecast), but also that they control both the short term and the long term outcomes of their interventions, which experience from MOSES modelling suggest that they will be uncapable of.

It is technically possible to speed up market processes such that financial markets come close to clearing in the sense that all firms that survive this competition earn the same rate of return, which is at the same time equal to the interest rate, a classical neoclassical equilibrium condition. We have done that and found that when all firms become almost equal (\u201crepresentative\u201d), diversity of structures is gone, markets have just about stopped functioning, and the MOSES model economy has begun to swing wildly before it collapses.

Even though static efficiency is increased, long term macroeconomic growth may suffer, as simulation experiments show. Allowing insiders to inform markets by their trades, on the other hand, does increase long term growth (<a href=\"#bib107\">Eliasson and Taymaz, 2001</a>. Up to a limit the innovation input of increased turnover of firms therefore raises long term sustainable growth.

Type II mistakes can only be defined in MOSES type economy wide agent-based models in which markets, governed by human capital (\u201ccompetence\u201d), self-coordinate activities and allocate resources. During such much less than fully informed market selection winners may get lost for such long times that the loss becomes in practice permanent for the local economy. The more complete and diversified local competence blocs the lower the risk that winners be lost. The ultimate economy wide outcomes therefore depend on how market agents that perform that allocation are spontaneously organized to <i>learn from experience to identify promising technologies (\u201cwinners\u201d</i>) and support their commercialization. <i>Competence bloc theory</i> explains that. Hence, business mistakes committed by market agents will embody information that can be learned to improve next period anticipations and plans. All that is represented in the MOSES model. Under such circumstances economic mistakes and their consequences should, of course, not be represented by stochastic processes, and the economy should not be modelled as a stationary process, a conclusion that brings up not only the absurdity of the rational expectations (RE) proposition, but also the relevance of the old distinction of <a href=\"#bib131\">Knight (1921)</a> between risk and uncertainty (<a href=\"#bib90\">Eliasson, 2015</a>). Competence bloc theory allows for winners to be permanently lost to the local economy, a possibility neoclassical economists tend to object to by arguing that in the end somebody else will come up with the same winning technology; an \"ergodic\" assumption of sorts.Perhaps, but it may be somewhere else and many years from now. The short period long term dynamics of the MOSES model in fact also embodies an answer to this. While winners may get lost (Type II mistakes), endogenous innovation,entry and commercialization in MOSES migh quite possibly generate long term winners that compensate for previously lost winners at some higherm level of aggregation. The point made in MOSES modelling is that the net flows of captured and lost winners over the longer term may be both positive and negative, and the difference will cumulate over time into sizable differences in economic wealth created, for instance, for a regional or national economy.",

Since the base for this superior competitiveness is the competence of local markets to identify , capture, support and successfully commercialize and scale up winning technologies, a local attractor of global financial resources has been created and sometimes on the scale needed to fund the commercialization and rapid scale up of for instance technology giants like Apple, Amazon, Alphabeth, Facebook, SpaceX and Tesla. The critical supporting factors behind those business successes are not only new technologies or entrepreneurial talent, but also the industrial competence of local competence blocs to move massive financial resources perseveringly in the right direction. Such complete, diversified and resourceful competence blocs have spontaneously emerged in US financial markets over a long time. The conclusion is close that the almost complete absence of such new technology giants in Europe is due to the dilution of industrial competence in the European financial communities the resources of which having in the post WWII period become governed by bureaucrats directed by political ambitions that has reduced the industrial competence of European venture capital finance. This is not the right organizatiopnal solution to create European technology winners to beat the US ones.

Venture capitalists were introduced in MOSES in <a href=\"#bib15\">Ballot et al. (2006)</a><b>,</b> who demonstrated that financial actors that had acquired industrial competence through learning from experience from previous investing, notably from their mistakes, improved the investment outcomes of financial allocations and long term economic growth, notably by reducing the incidence of type II mistakes. In a long-term perspective Type II economic mistakes are the most important to avoid <a href=\"#bib181\">Eliasson and Taymaz (2021)</a> demonstrated in MOSES experiments. They concluded that complete competence blocs appear to be a major growth enhancing market \u201cinstitutions\u201d in an advanced industrial economy, and that understanding opportunity costs therefore becomes a critical guiding principle for policy makers in MOSES economies. There is thus no reason to assume that social costs in the form of foregone long term economic value creation are small. On the contrary we may be considering the consequences of fundamental changes in the organization of advanced economies and how to cope sucessfully with them. The massive reorganizations of the worlds's largest economy in the past decades mentioned above that have made the US economy grow faster than almost all industrial economies point to the importance of the industrial competence of financial markets (read conpetence blocs). There is also the obvious corollary that European policy ambitions to redirect venture capital provisions under the governance of bureacrats has reduced that same industrial competence in the European financial community. This has not only reulted in a self inclicted European policy mistake of perhaps massive dimensions. It may also have prevented the European economies from developing the technology giants politicians are craving for (<a href=\"#bib85\">Eliasson, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Eliasson, 2022</a>). To make the situation worse , the experience based industrial competences needed in the finacial community, to judge by MOSES simulation analyses, may take very long to build (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ballot et al., 2006</a>). To sum up, the policy morale reads: (1) encourage bold investments in private markets governed by free competitive entry, (2) promote market competition to identify and correct business mistakes fast, and (3) make sure that complete competence blocs have been both allowed, and politically encouraged to develop spontaneously to minimize Type II economic mistakes. Finally (4), regard Type 1 mistakes as a standard costs for economic development that are necessary to minimize the risk of committing the far more socially costly Type II mistakes (<a href=\"#bib99\">Eliasson and Eliasson, 2005</a>). Competence bloc theory is a time sequenced schedule of human capital (competence) based decisions that may be taken independently in markets, or are internalized within hierarchies. It is therefore the perfect blueprint for modelling the endogenous formation of firm hierarchies in markets (<i><a href=\"#bib95\">Eliasson, 2023b</a></i> and Sect. 4.5 below).",

However, and this is one theoretical novelty of MOSES economics, if (as in <a href=\"#bib56\">Eliasson, 1976a</a>) building the MOSES model bottom up on algorithms based on observations (in <a href=\"#bib56\">Eliasson, 1976a</a>) on how firms form price expectations, make up plans, react to, and learn from these plans that constantly fail to be realized as planned, when they are confronted with other agents\u2019 plans in markets, you will find that <i>no ex post neo - Walrasian equilibrium to head for exists</i>. Why this is so I have already explained (Sect 1.3 and <a href=\"#bib74\">Eliasson (1991a)</a>. <a href=\"#bib45\">Clower (1965)</a> claims that Keynes understood all this, and had the wider theory needed to discuss ex ante and ex post economics \u201cat the back of his mind, or most of the <i>General Theory</i> is theoretical nonsense\u201d.",

And satisfactory long run systems properties are basic to both the theoretical and empirical validation of the MOSES model. The equilibrium concept we are looking for must therefore be something very different from what economic orthodoxy assumes to be fundamental. For me it boils down to identifying a parameterization of the model economy that keeps aggregate output constantly safely above zero, and long term growth reasonably stable nd not to far below the upper constraint defined by the \"best practice technologies\" brought in by firms' endogenous investments. To \"maximize\" the rate at which the bounded region within which the economy progresses, and to \u201cminimize\u201d the fluctuations of the economy within that same bounded region may be a desired policy objective. But there are clear limits to what can be achieve witout causing more social damage than the benefits of such countercyclical policies are worth. The bounded range of economic progress must not be made too narrow (by policy) , because faster economic growth is unavoidably associated with a constant churning of structures forcing factors of production to be reallocated over markets. This is practical down to earth simulation analysis that will be conditioned each time by (1) the initial state vector, (2) by the most realistic projection of \u201cbest practice technologies\u201d, and (3) by projections of remaining exogenous variables (see Sections 3.2 and 3.4).<sup><a href=\"#fn9\">9</a></sup> This dynamic raises a new and unfamiliar perspective on welfare economics and business cycle policy, a new perspective created when the Stockholm School economists and Joseph Schumpeter are allowed into the orderly garden of neo Walrasian economics.",

The latter reflected concerns in the business community, notably among members of the Federation of Swedish Industries, and an irritation about the lack of attention paid to the role of firms in macro development by economists and politicians alike. Consequently, <i>empirical relevance should guide the specification of the model, not compatibility with any economic doctrine</i>.

The latter had been inserted in MOSES after some nonlinear features had been added (investment demand and demand for intermediate goods were modelled at firm level). Very soon thereafter the production structure of the model was expanded to be based on a complete eleven sector input output model restructured onto the OECD End Use classification to be compatible with the market categorization firms used in the micro data we collected in a separate survey, the <i>Planning Survey</i> of the Federation of Swedish Industries. Four sectors or subindustries could now be populated with (data on) real individual firms (see Appendix). From above, the <i>model now</i> came out as a familiar eleven sector Leontief \u2013 Keynes <i>model</i> (see Figure 2.1 in <a href=\"#bib62\">Eliasson, 1980a</a> Republished in this Anthology).<sup><a href=\"#fn10\">10</a></sup> An estimated such sector model was at the time available from a separate project at the Industrial Institute for Economic and Social Research (IUI) that I had been involved in putting together and had access to.

Firms in the MOSES model base their decisions on data that (1) reflect the \"disequilibrium\" situation in the real economy, but (2) are also afflicted by statsistical errors, most important the errors that depend on inconsistencies between public Nataional Accounts (NA) and Planning Survey data, that were concentrated in the synthetic firms created from the differences between NA data and the aggregated Planning Survey data for each market to scale the model up to NA level. It was importanrt that these statistical errors be minimized, since in non linear initial state dependent models of the MOSES type they tend to cumulate (see Appendix (Section A.1.5), and <a href=\"#bib8\">Albrecht et al.

Firms in those cloned MOSES economies imitate superior firms in other cloned economies, a specification that can be more generally interpreted and modeled to include different kinds of interaction, including direct trade in technologies, foreign direct investments (FDI) and the movement of human capital by allowing firms to recruit across borders very much as already done within the MOSES model (see <a href=\"#bib57\">Eliasson, 1976b</a> and sections 4.4.4 and 6.2 below).

This is a major statistical job, that was needed for the cost benefit study of the industrial support program of the 1970s, which also had a generous budget (see Sect. 4.3). We have, however, developed a method to keep the model constantly ready for empirically less ambitious studies. From a carefully prepared initial state, for instance the one for for 1982 (see <a href=\"#bib6\">Albrecht, 1992</a>), the model can be simulated forward \u201cguided by\u201d known exogenous variables. It can then be reinitiated by substituting the most recent firm data from the annual Planning Survey for the simulated firm data, within the simulated macro frame of the model. This procedure makes it possible to keep the MOSES model constantly ready for \u201csemi-empirical\u201d simulation studies that require an updated initial state data base. For principal analyses of this kind it is not necessary to have access to new Planning Survey firm data. Model simulations generate complete micro to macro and stock flow consistent initial states for each future quarter. For theoretical studies these artificial initial states are in fact to be preferred to a complete reinstallation of MOSES on a new data base, since then all errors due to inconsistencies between Planning Survey firm data and official National Accounts will have to be fixed again. The simulated initial states can also be customized for the study to be done by varying exogenous variables or parameters etc such that a desired initial state is obtained, for instance a balanced macro-economic situation to eliminate the effects of cyclical factors over the longer run.",

This would however be a misspecification for anything beyond the very short run, and MOSES experience from dynamic simulations does not recommend such static calculation methods. Since the MOSES model has only been calibrated on a selection of critical target variables that are directly affected by the feed back dynamics just mentioned, but routinely \u201cpredicts\u201d many more, the principal problem of how to interpret the latter remains. Since these secondary dependent variables are tightly (linearly) related to the critical variables against which the model has been calibrated, difficult to understand extreme behavior of these variables will therefore, as a rule, be associated with extreme behavior of the test variables.

Such tests frequently led to changes in model specification, and made us look for inconsistencies in data inputs, and suggested modification of some calibrated parameters. An absolute requirement set up for the MOSES model has been that the economy wide behavior of the calibrated version stays viable over the very long run. Collapse like behavior of the calibrated version over the very long run has always been a cause for concern and made us identify the reason. The most important example of this theoretical or empirical validation (See Section 2.3) was that the MOSES economy tended to exhibit strong fluctuations and collapse like behavior in some experiments. Sometimes it occurred when we allowed the model to run into the very long term in a short-term empirical experiment to see what happened. Sometimes we provoked the model by changing its parameter setting to force markets to reduce inefficiencies. The latter were theoretical experiments conducted in response to academic criticisms that we had not properly clarified the equilibrium properties of the model. We then found that a static market clearing equilibrium state of the model was unattainable, and for good theoretical reasons (<a href=\"#bib73\">Eliasson, 1991b</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Eliasson, 1991b</a> Sect.2.3 above), but also that collapse like behavior of the model economy should be considered normal under extreme conditions. The typical reason was a rapidly deteriorating diversity of structures and the convergence of a shrinking firm population towards similar (\u201crepresentative\u201d) firms, making markets dysfunctional. Turning on a closed down entry module and endogenizing entry remedied this model deficiency.<sup><a href=\"#fn25\">25</a></sup> An important consequence of these theoretical experiments was that we started to study Planning Survey firm data more closely, and discovered that Swedish manufacturing had experienced a deteriorating structural diversity for many years due to reduced entry of new firms. We alerted Swedish policy makers and academics to the macroeconomic economic risks inherent in that development, but with mixed success (see Section 5.4).",

Since the MOSES model integrates several familiar partial models, and since many of its \u201csurprising\u201d dynamic properties largely depend on how markets integrate those partial models, it represents a <i>cognitive theoretical design</i> that we have frequently called in for <i>complex general economic reasoning</i>, not least to help pay attention to side effects of political interventions that are neglected by prior design in the common repertoire of partial models. This is particularly so when it comes to the role of dynamic markets populated by autonomous agents with own agendas in understanding macro (see Sect. 5). Results from simulations could therefore, as we will see below, be comprehensively presented in familiar and observable terms, or categories making up the internal artificial reality of the MOSES model economy. Avoiding abstract concepts such as elasticities or other mathematical categories that much too often have no empirical meaning to non \u2013 economists has helped widen the audience to non-professionals. This use of the MOSES model also explains our early concern with empirical credibility, and our emphasis on empirically relevant specification. A principally important example of this is that \u201clabor market\u201d models that lack explicit markets do not provide credible advice on unemployment policies. Policies aimed at changing relative wages or lowering unemployment are much too often based on empirical research that neglects the economy wide effects of market agents\u2019 own reactions. When markets in MOSES experiments were allowed to play a role in the analysis, results came out very differently, and not as expected.

The same year IUI teamed up with the Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences (IVA) to clarify, on contract with the Swedish Technical Development Board (STU, a government authority subordinated the Ministry of Industry), the technical and industrial competence endowment of Swedish manufacturing, and by implication the role of new technologies in Swedish economic growth in the past, and for the future. The MOSES model came to be used as a cognitive instrument to sort out different explanations of how the post oil crises stagnation had been caused, and to suggest policy solutions to get the economy out of its distress. As part of this so called \u201cGrand Project\u201d, IVA\u2019s members, most of them technical directors in large Swedish firms, could be tapped for quantitative information about the historic development of best practice technologies. In addition to being of great interest to the\u201d Grand Project\u201d when interpreted in terms of the model, this data was used both to run historic experiments, and to calibrate the MOSES model.<sup><a href=\"#fn32\">32</a></sup> This project provided research results for an international IUI conference 1977 published as <a href=\"#bib40\">Carlsson et al., (1978)</a> and <a href=\"#bib43\">Carlsson and Olavi, (1978)</a>, and caught the attention of the Directorate of Science, Technology and Innovation of the OECD, which asked for complementary simulation studies on the role of human capital, and education in economic growth, and commercialization competence. Several publications followed (<a href=\"#bib39\">Carlsson et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Carlsson, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Carlsson et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Eliasson, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Eliasson, 1980b</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Eliasson, 1981</a>).<sup><a href=\"#fn33\">33</a></sup> This time the main contribution of the MOSES model was improved \u201ccognitive insight\u201d rather than micro to macro quantification. The economy wide micro market format of the MOSES model made the <i>integration of technology and economics through commercializing markets</i> a central concern. It kept us from getting locked up in the partial tunnel vision of the linear technology growth drive proposition attributed to <a href=\"#bib158\">Schumpeter (1942)</a> that had become popular policy among stagnating economies on which Keynesian demand had been found not to work. The story now became, subsidize R&amp;D investment and growth will return. Of course this did not work, since it <i>neglected the costly complementary commercialization phase of identifying and scaling up technologies, as well as the complementary human capital needed</i>. We found (see Section 2.1 on competence bloc theory) our focus on a more market minded <a href=\"#bib157\">Schumpeter (1911)</a> to be more promising. (From the perspective of economic doctrines it is however interesting to observe that the linear Schumpeter of 1942, that grew into the \u201cnational innovation systems\u201cproposition of <a href=\"#bib112\">Freeman (1974)</a>; <a href=\"#bib113\">Freeman (1987)</a>; <a href=\"#bib139\">Lundvall (1992)</a>; <a href=\"#bib144\">Nelson (1992)</a> and <a href=\"#bib145\">Nelson (1993)</a>,<sup><a href=\"#fn34\">34</a></sup> also branched out into a neoclassical version called New Growth theory, first formulated by <a href=\"#bib153\">Romer (1986)</a>. This time R&amp;D fueled macro innovation functions created network productivity externalities and then economic growth. From our point of view it is interesting to note that the network externalities are represented in new growth theory models, for instance <a href=\"#bib153\">Romer (1986)</a> and <a href=\"#bib194\">Jones and Williams (1998)</a> by an assumed positive macro relationship between a general collective knowledge capital and all other factors of production (an externality, see <a href=\"#bib80\">Eliasson, 1996</a>). Those <i>network externalities can be simulated on MOSES as an endogenized consequence of financial market resource reallocations</i> (<a href=\"#bib57\">Eliasson, 1976b</a>), <i>and/or reallocations of the human capital of trained workers</i> (see Section 4.4.4 below). Without <i>complementary financial</i> market and human capital support, we found, little growth should be expected from new technology creation. On the other hand, improved labor and financial market performance, holding technology constant (No change in best practice new technologies) was found to significantly raise macro productivity growth over the medium term, until the reallocation effects of improved market selection had petered out (<a href=\"#bib61\">Eliasson, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Eliasson, 1981</a>). Similarly, simulation experiments gave no support for worries about technological unemployment. Job losses in stagnant industries caused by competition from technologically superior firms, that in turn caused a general macroeconomic expansion were compensated for by new job creations, accompanied by a temporary rise in transactions unemployment, as workers moved to new jobs over the labor market. In fact, if markets did not do that job, and/or if defunct producers did not shut down (Section 4.3) the technology induced expansion might fail altogether to come about. A series of MOSES simulations demonstrated that growth and employment outcomes required significant complementary structural change (<a href=\"#bib38\">Carlsson et al., 1981</a>). Sustainable long term growth was in general impossible to achieve without significant complementary churning of production structures, increases in investments in new and profitable firms, exits of inferior producers, and significant accompanying movements of workers over the market from low performing to fast growing firms. Again, the labor market had to function as a market for these positive results to materialize. (These conclusions may sound self-evident, and they are, but MOSES simulation results played a role in preventing simplistic (partial) stories from dominating the economic policy discussion in Sweden, and in particular the proposition, pushed by unions, that manufacturing firms with problems should be subsidized to train their workers to be capable of \u201creorganizing themselves from within\u201d without forcing workers to change jobs over the market. The next MOSES project tells a sad story on that theme).",

The first part was already available with the IUI study <a href=\"#bib27\">Bentzel et al.

Neither was it very clever of Swedish Government to make Swedish taxpayers subsidize the highest paid workers in industry to produce in practice zero value added for almost a decade, depriving the rest of industry of their work input, and pushing up wages, generally slowing economic growth elsewhere). In <a href=\"#bib38\">Carlsson et al. (1981)</a> and <a href=\"#bib35\">Carlsson (1983)</a> different alternative ways of distributing the subsidy money (the public budget remaining unchanged) were simulated on MOSES and compared with what was actually decided in the Government budget to be done well into the 1990s under the official prediction of exogenous variables as published in the Government Long Term Survey (\u201cL\u00e5ngtidsutredningen\u201d). The optimal policy turned out to be to terminate the subsidy program immediately, and disburse the subsidy money back to all Swedish firms in the form of a flat rate lowering of the payroll tax.<sup><a href=\"#fn35\">35</a></sup> When subsidies were discontinued the shipyards promptly went bankrupt (depleted their net worth and exited), and Swedish manufacturing returned to the previous faster growth trend that the subsidies had forced it off. In the interim period it had however dropped to a lower level of output that had not been recovered at the end of simulations (<a href=\"#bib42\">Carlsson et al., 2018</a>). The main reason for that was that the subsidies had both locked skilled workers into zero value added production, depriving the rest of manufacturing of their work input, and raised the general wage level, thus discouraging firms in general from investing and expanding. Shipyard workers were forced into the market when subsidies were terminated in 1985, but in a couple of years they were all (in model simulations) reemployed elsewhere, albeit at lower wages. That the speed of market correction so estimated is not that unrealistic witness the ex post assessment of the study in <a href=\"#bib42\">Carlsson et al., 2018</a>. When Government abandoned its previous employment protection policies, allowing the labor market in particular to conduct its allocation functions better from 1995, industrial structures promptly began to reorganize, and production growth shot up with statistically negligible adverse consequences for unemployment.

In a series of publications Gerard Ballot and Erol Taymaz have improved upon MOSES specification of human capital input in productionin by introducing both general and specific training of workers, to make labor in practice heterogeneous. Even though individual workers could not yet be followed as they moved from firm to firm, the model kept track of the average human capital stock of the firm, and how it was affected by general and specific training of its workers, and how that stock changed when its trained workers moved to other firms (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ballot and Taymaz, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ballot and Taymaz, 1996</a>).",

This was also the first MOSES study based on Planning Survey data, first installed in the 1976 initial state database. While the ambition primarily was to test the model for reasonable behavior, and to demonstrate what the MOSES model could do, it, however, told a story not entirely familiar and therefore worth documenting. First, this so called \u00c5man law did not necessarily have any effect on employment. The costs for rehiring normally keep firms from laying off workers for short term reasons. Second, firms in the MOSES database, we later found by studying the panel data of the MOSES database (<a href=\"#bib77\">Eliasson, 1992b</a>), normally hoard workers, but to a varying extent, to be able to flexibly adapt production to variations in demand. Third, when firms are forced to keep workers employed for up to a maximum of six months, which they would otherwise have laid off, model simulations predict that society incurs a double-sided transactions cost. The immediate effect is lower output. Since firms, however, also reorganize to maintain their profit margins the incidence on profits of the \u00c5man law is almost entirely shifted back onto all workers of the firm in the form of lower real wage increases. All this comes in the form of endogenous adjustments within the firm model. So if the \u00c5man law was instituted as an insurance against unemployment, it appeared (1) not to be effective, and (2) the costs of this not effective insurance was squarely carried by the worker collective, not by the firms, as was the original political ambition.",

By broadening the notion of specific skills to the concept of <i>receiver competence</i> (<a href=\"#bib71\">Eliasson, 1990a</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Eliasson et al., 1986</a><a href=\"#bib72\">Eliasson, 1990b</a>) a new perspective on innovation, entrepreneurship, commercialization and economic evolution opened (see Section 2 on competence bloc theory) and in the end to generate macroeconomic growth.<sup><a href=\"#fn37\">37</a></sup> In doing so, <a href=\"#bib20\">Ballot and Taymaz (1997)</a> demonstrated that investments in (complementary) general training to create new technologies may be a waste of resources if the firm does not also have the <i>specific</i> skills, mentioned above, needed to convert the new technologies created into innovation rents by advancing productivities and earnings capacities (commercialization and scale up).",

The CEMI had been charged with studying ways to introduce markets in the rigid Soviet economy and some visiting Soviet economists got wind of the MOSES modelling project, among them Nicolai Petrakov, one of the directors of CEMI. It was agreed that a compacted version of MOSES be transferred to a Norsk Data desk computer at CEMI to be loaded with Soviet data.

Rather than <span class=\"underline\">how</span>, we identified <span class=\"underline\">what not</span> to do, and why static equilibrium modelling, needing the Walrasian central auctioneer to coordinate the economy, was a bad idea. <a href=\"#bib180\">Antonov and Trofimov (1993)</a> demonstrated that mandating the firms in the MOSES model economy to follow Keynesian or Neoclassical macro model forecasts (reestimated every quarter on data generated by MOSES by the central planning authority) was a growth depressant. When freed of those mandates, the model economy outperformed the policy mandated version in generating very long run macro economic growth. When firms were left alone to use its own adaptive price anticipations and ad hoc decision rules, in the free market regime so defined individual firms happened to come upon, identify and commercialize winning technologies that they had missed under the constrained policy regime (Type II economic mistakes). (On the other hand, the GNP composition of output under the positive market scenario was endogenously determined and also beyond central policy control. In later MOSES studies we found that if global prices were developing close to a steady relative price change, and therefore predictable in expectation by firms\u2019 adaptive expectations algorithms, a central policy aimed at technological imitation, rather than innovation, might be a medium term winner, however leading to a technological lock in into old structures and a dangerous competitive exposure to unexpected global technological innovation of the Internet revolution kind). In <a href=\"#bib83\">Eliasson (1998)</a>, finally the results of MOSES simulations were incorporated in summarizing the benefits of a free market economy, but also the problems of achieving an orderly transfer of a planned economy to a market economy. That, however, in turn required, it was observed, that the institutions supporting trade in intangible assets, notably property rights, be developed (<a href=\"#bib182\">Eliasson and Wihlborg, 2003</a>). The property rights institution was one of the pillars of a market economy in serious disrepair in the Soviet economy.",

The Government asked Assar Lindbeck, a well known Swedish economist, to lead a Commission to suggest policy remedies. Special studies were subcontracted to economists across the country. I was asked to contribute something on micro to macro, a bit of Schumpeterian entrepreneurship and some results from our simulation studies on the role of human capital in economic growth (<a href=\"#bib78\">Eliasson, 1993</a>). The Lindbeck commission came up with 113 detailed recommendations (<i>Nya villkor f\u00f6r ekonomi och politik</i>. Ekonomikommissionens f\u00f6rslag, <a href=\"#bib146\">SOU, 1993</a>). It, however, failed to take the micro to macro dimension explicitly into account, and the deteriorating diversity of production structures that we pointed to appeared not to have been taken seriously. Most (not all) of the 113 explicit pieces of advice, however, would anyhow have come out of a MOSES based study. We therefore published our own IUI analysis of the economic situation in <a href=\"#bib10\">Andersson et al. (1993)</a> in which the need for a market directed reorganization of production structures was argued to be needed to restore a precariously deteriorated diversity because of a long-term decline in entrepreneurial entry. This, again illustrates the <a href=\"#bib109\">Feldstein (1982)</a> remark that <i>all models are exactly wrong in some respects, but that they may still be used together with experience and common sense to come out vaguely right</i>. It also illustrated the method discussed in Section 5.1 to use the MOSES economy wide and general framework as cognitive support for partial analysis. It would thus not have hurt the case to test at least some of the 113 policy propositions of the Lindbeck Commission on the MOSES model for the possibility of being wrong, or simply irrelevant in the wider perspective of a complex economic situation.

About these models Richiardi observes that; (1) ad hoc and not well grounded assumptions are often resorted to, (2) too many degrees of freedom mean models are non-falsifiable, (3) lack of empirical grounding and ad hoc calibration mean lack of empirical credibility, (4) poorly documented specification prevents replication of experiments, and (5) great demands on technical and programming skills make both the use, and expansion of agent based models difficult. They tend to exist for a while in isolation and then be forgotten. We have been aware of these problems throughout MOSES\u2019 50-year history, and they apply to almost all microsimulation models I know of, but this Anthology should show that they don\u2019t apply to the MOSES project. This Anthology should rather make clear about 1,2 and 3 that there is little or no ad hoc economics associated with the MOSES project, and that we have taken validation of the model seriously, perhaps even too seriously. In fact (4) was easily overcome in <a href=\"#bib32\">Brostr\u00f6m (2003)</a>, a master student at Link\u00f6ping Technical University who set MOSES up for advanced simulation experiments and concluded his thesis in six months. Also (5) should not be that much of a problem. My 17 year old grandson managed to convert MOSES to object oriented code directly from the coding manual and without doing it by way of the current APL code, to run a few experiments, and to write <a href=\"#bib137\">Lindstenz (2023)</a> in three weeks (<a href=\"#bib57\">Eliasson, 1976b</a><sup><a href=\"#fn39\">39</a></sup> That the Planning Survey includes critical proprietary data is a problem that was overcome with the creation of a deidentified version for external users by <a href=\"#bib165\">Taymaz (1992a)</a>.

The three current active modelers are retired, and more interested in studying the artificial realities of the MOSES model economy when customized for different problems, than to engage in a new full scale empirical inquiry. But one experience acquired from the MOSES project is that even general theoretical analysis, to be interesting, requires relevant empirical specification. Current MOSES maintenance is therefore focused on conducting general analyses on the specification, database availability and calibrated parameters that we already have, and make sure to document what we have done so that somebody can take over the transfer job, and improve upon the specification such that MOSES can be quickly updated and readied for a full scale empirical project when a sufficient budget is offered. A must is then that the long-planned extension with a micro specified household sector be done to make possible empirically credible studies of how income and wealth distributions relate to economy wide progress. To be properly done the latter requires that the co-evolution of human capital and physical capital resource reallocations with asset prices be simultaneously studied. For that MOSES has to be translated from APL to object code such that that the flows of human capital between housweholds/individuals and production agents are made explicit. Parts of the needed data and model respecification for that was in fact prepared long ago. (see below). And the needed conversion of the model to C++ should not be that difficult. So doing interesting general micro to macro dynamics on the artificial realities of the MOSES model economy, and preparing it for future serious empirical studies on the basis of what we have already done, is the current strategy.",

A micro household empirical implementation can thus be naturally integrated with the 1982 database. It should also be noted that a satisfactory micro household implementation for the most interesting applications (for instance income and wealth distribution consequences of more or less successful growth scenarios) does not need a database of thousands of households, which should therefore not be attempted. A sample of households of different human capital characteristics should be sufficient. The most challenging task when it comes to individuals will be how to represent human capital relevantly, not least how human capital, the dominan production capital appears in the formation and operation of firms (<a href=\"#bib71\">Eliasson, 1990a</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Eliasson, 1990b</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Eliasson, 2023b</a>).

A revised firm model in MOSES that captures this has long been prepared (see <a href=\"#bib183\">Eliasson, 2021</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Eliasson, 2023a</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Eliasson, 2023b</a>, and could naturally be integrated with the work on labor markets and human capital accumulation in the MOSES model of Ballot &amp; Taymaz (see Section 4.4).",

To some extent Gerard Ballot and Erol Taymaz has already made human capital heterogeneous in MOSES (see Section 4.4.2), but a micro household sector (\u00a71) would be a great step forward in that respect. \u00a74 above is about how markets evaluate human capital in production decisions. More problematic will be to represent quality differentiation in product markets, especially since new technology creation over MOSES history has shifted from allocating R&D investments to the raising of manufacturing productivity towards increasing product qualities. The assumption that markets perfectly represent product quality change in prices was reasonable before the new Millenium, but is no longer. With households being modelled in micro, not only labor can be made heterogenous, but also the possibility of modelling customer competence in appreciating product quality in their purchasing decisions.",

Ergodicity is a special case of self-coordination, namely when markets guide the economy to the same final state, irrespective of initial conditions. Since the models Samuelson was referring to have no markets, my proposition is theoretically different. A wider definition of ergodicity, applicable to the MOSES model economy would therefore be to study under what market circumstances the MOSES economy stays bounded from above and below under a market self-coordinated regime, and to investigate what happens when that wide band within which the economy evolves is gradually narrowed by policy intervention to, for instance, make markets more efficient, or to remove cyclical unemployment spells (for such countercyclical policy experiments on MOSES (see <a href=\"#bib105\">Eliasson and Taymaz, 1992</a> in this Anthology). The more narrowly bounded the closer to the mathematical definition of an ergodic model it would come. I have argued that an interesting policy experiment would be to try to\u201d policy manage\u201d the MOSES model economy into a reasonably narrow bounded such range that expands as rapidly as is possible without becoming unstable over the longer run. Trying to pin the MOSES model economy down on a steady state, and the same steady state irrespective of initial conditions, the ultimate definition of an ergodic process, we already know will be a vain ambition, since such a state is not an attainable state in the MOSES economy. However, trying to identify a maximum possible welfare compatible such expansion range through policy simulation would be an interesting policy study (see section 1.3).",

Its self-coordination property for most of its life has occurred under an upper exogenous global technological boundary, a constraint that was partially lifted with the <a href=\"#bib21\">Ballot and Taymaz (1998)</a> firm based endogenous innovation module. Exogenous foreign prices, including the foreign interest rate still constrain market self-coordination, even though there is no lower boundary, since the model economy might collapse completely if development reduces its diversity of structures too much. For instance, markets in MOSES stop functioning when the number of firms has been reduced below three. They stop functioning well already when agents become too similar (too \u201crepresentative\u201d, <a href=\"#bib67\">Eliasson, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Eliasson, 1991b</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Eliasson, 1991a</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Eliasson, 1991c</a>), and there is no Walrasian central price setter in MOSES capable of taking over the market coordination job. A study of fundamental theoretical interest would therefore be (see Section 3.4) to explore the market self-coordination, and thus \u201cergodic\u201d, properties of the MOSES economy further by endogenizing also global price determination and the interest rate. The <a href=\"#bib25\">Ballot and Taymaz (2012)</a> cloning of MOSES models into a global economy has already laid the foundation for such a study. By adding trade in innovations (technologies) between the cloned MOSES economies, the global pool of best practice technologies could also be endogenized, and foreign prices be endogenously set by trade between the cloned economies. Such experiments on the MOSES model economy would take us closer to understanding the dynamics of an Experimentally Organized Economy.",

The incompatibility between the market demand taxonomy of the firm data (collected in the planning Survey and used in the MOSES model) and the production taxonomy of NA statistics thus became a problem. For how that problem has been solved, see <a href=\"#bib5\">Albrecht (1979)</a> and <a href=\"#bib7\">Albrecht et al. (1989)</a>. This statistical dichotomy is however of principal economic interest since both real firms and MOSES firms base their decisions on the data collected in the Planning Survey, and thus react to both these statistical \u201cerrors\u201d and the \u201creality\u201d reflected in the data. For various reasons these errors may be initially much too large in that some of the\u201d synthetic\u201d firms crated from the residual between the NA data and the sum of all Planning Survey firms come out much too wrong. By running the model for a few years, the endogenous market machinery of the model eliminates the extreme \u201coutliers\u201d among the synthetic firms, and a new and micro to macro and stock flow consistent initial state has been established (For more on this \"breaking in\" procedure (see <a href=\"#bib166\">Taymaz, 1992b</a>).",

Numerical simulation mathematics has opened a vista of empirically relevant general economic theorizing that largely remains unexploited. During the last couple of decades MOSES research has moved in that direction. An economy wide, agent based, nonlinear and initial state model to be economically interesting, however, requires a minimum of empirical input that characterizes the economy being studied. The most important empirical characterization is embodied in the model\u2019s specification, which should therefore be empirically well grounded. It is, for instance, hard to imagine dynamic economics to be interestingly pursued without behaving agents, market selection and periodic feed backs, and thus non linearities and initial state dependencies. Much of the empirical characterization is therefore also defined by the initial state, which is needed to start a simulation experiment, the latter being a matter of good economic measurement. This foundation of MOSES modelling is different from other models aspiring to be general. It is mainly due to its micro market foundation and unique Stockholm School expectations ex ante ex post learning, and feedback loops at agent level, the latter being very familiar features of real business life. In the end I therefore plan to develop a general theory of industrial economics based on the MOSES design, that will be distinctly different from static industrial organization (I/O) theory (see Section 6). This Appendix therefore illustrates how alternating theoretical and empirical studies on the MOSES model has made it increasingly more relevant for pursuing such ambitions.",

On this <a href=\"#bib30\">Binmore (1995)</a> observes ironically that there are economists who consider initial state independent models superior to other models \u201cbecause they are able to generate predictions with less data\u201d. Not so with MOSES. The MOSES model is very data demanding by design. Its specification is however such that direct measurement of its initial state y(t-1) has eliminated several parameters that would otherwise have been needed to explain how the model economy arrived at y(t-1). In explaining y(t) = F(y(t-1), x) a large part of the effort therefore goes into determining (measuring) y(t-1) which operates on y(t) in the same way as the exogenous variables. Direct measurement of the initial state thus substitutes for parameter estimation.<sup><a href=\"#fn40\">40</a></sup>",

The initial state therefore becomes a \u201csnapshot\u201d picture of a market <i>equilibrating process</i> that normally stays bounded from above and below , but that may topple over if seriously disturbed, Wicksellian cumulative inflation being one example (<a href=\"#bib92\">Eliasson, 2017a</a>), near economic systems collapse another (<a href=\"#bib73\">Eliasson, 1991b</a>). Equilibrium resting places thus don\u2019t exist in MOSES (Section 2.3). A simulation furthermore generates consistent micro to macro-SF consistent states from quarter to quarter, and under \u201cideal\u201d market circumstances, forever . Hence it is of general economic interest to ask whether the MOSES model exhibits \u201cergodic properties\u201d in the sense that it tends to converge into the same approximate state in the very long run, irrespective of initial conditions (see again section 2.3). However, I do not regard this to be a necessary property of an empirically relevant economic model, and MOSES simulations for as long as we have simulated them tend to diverge significantly (<a href=\"#bib106\">Eliasson and Taymaz, 2000</a>).

In early experiments the model became collapse prone when the diversity of (endogenous) production structures had been reduced too much (<a href=\"#bib67\">Eliasson, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Eliasson, 1991b</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Eliasson, 1991a</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Eliasson, 1991c</a>). That undesired property disappeared when sustained diversity had been restored through the introduction of new innovative (also endogenous) entry (<a href=\"#bib123\">Hansen and Heckman, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib189\">Hanson, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib164\">Taymaz, 1991b</a>). A related example is that markets in the model stop functioning when the number of firms has been reduced too much by excessive exits. This should not happen under normal circumstances but can be engineered by subjecting the markets of the model economy to extreme exogenous pressure, for instance extreme policies , or other external shocks (see <a href=\"#bib59\">Eliasson, 1978a</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Eliasson, 1978b</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Eliasson and Taymaz, 1992</a>). It can also occur if firms are excessively myopic, and for that reason make the economy generally vulnerable to external disturbances. The latter occurred when MOSES firms were subjected to the oil price shocks that hit the global economy in 1973/75 and started the next period with excessive inflationary expectations (\u201cprice overshooting\u201d) that led to an extreme wage escalation. When wages got stuck at the high levels, but product prices dropped back, notably in in raw materials and intermediate product markets, a macro economic disaster occurred both in the MOSES model and in Swedish reality (See Section 4.3). Real firms may in fact use na\u00efve expectations algorithms (see <a href=\"#bib56\">Eliasson, 1976a</a>), which may lead to such consequences when markets get disturbed. To that end we complemented the first myopic smoothing expectations algorithms with both an error correction (learning) and a risk aversion component. This memory of past expectational mistakes was introduced in the early expectations functions of firms after we had compared the rates of diffusion of exogenous price shocks in the MOSES economy with the rates of price transmission that occurred after the oil price shocks in the Swedish economy (<a href=\"#bib55\">Eliasson, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Eliasson, 1976b</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Eliasson, 1978a</a>; <a href=\"#bib114\">Genberg 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib115\">Genberg, 1983</a>). The general picture that emerged was that price transmission througha diversified economy takes time andif excessive to begin with is likely to be boosted (\"price overshooting\") and prolonged. Compiling a high quality micro to macro and stock flow consistent initial state description that also includes a past history of individual firms\u2019 market experiences is therefore a requisite for having carried out an empirical study on the MOSES model (Section 3.11).",

For each manufacturing market Planning Survery firms were then aggregated and the difference to the NA accounts so obtained, one residual firm for each markets, computed. Each residual firm was then divided up into component firms such that known distributional patterns (sizes, productivities, wages etc) to the extent possible were maintained. The problem was that inconsistencies between the different databases, and statistical errors tended to concentrate in the residual firms . This meant that among the synthetic firms so obtained some had been created so handicapped as to be incapable of surviving the competition in MOSES markets. During the first couple of years the MOSES economy was therefore shaken by massive firm death (exits), then to emerge with a new micro to macro stock flow consistent initial state, the distributional characteristics of which we could then compare with a new Planning Survey two or three years later. In most simulation studies we thus allowed for a two or three year break in period. For principal (\"theoretical\") studies this was not a problem. Testing for the accuracy of the new initial state so obtained would however have to await new final NA accounts data to arrive, and even so it was an open question whether the MOSES generated NA data or the official nationall accounts were the most accurate ones. Since MOSES can generate consistent quarterly micro to macro stock flow National Accounts data of creat detail, we have even considered using a calibrated MOSES model to generate the statistical NA accounts that do no yet exist for the Swedish economy. Ponder then that the market based aggregation achieved in MOSES simulations in many ways reproduces more consistently what is currently done manually in the Swedish Central Bureau of Statistics.",

Following <a href=\"#bib123\">Hansen and Heckman (1996)</a> we prefer to refer to what we have done as <i>calibration</i>, until a satisfactory method to determine the stochastic properties of the calculated parameters has been worked out. This is a technical notation and does not mean a downgrading of the empirical credibility of our results. Estimation difficulties depend on the model specification, the empirical credibility of which, in my view takes priority in determining the empirical credibility of the entire model (see Section 3.5). The thoroughly researched and robust design of the MOSES model has also meant that direct measurement in many places substitutes for parameter estimation, that has in turn considerably reduced the number of dynamically critical parameters that would otherwise have had to be estimated.<sup><a href=\"#fn43\">43</a></sup> Thus, for instance, by substituting directly observed (in <a href=\"#bib56\">Eliasson, 1976a</a>) expectations and decision algorithms in firms for time reaction equations the number of parameters that regulate the economy <i>wide dynamics of the model has been reduced to a couple of dozens. In early versions of MOSES, for instance, firms exited when they had run out of</i> equity. Laid off workers were then supplied in the labor market, depreciated machinery was supplied in the investment goods markets, and the firm\u2019s product inventories were added to market supply. In later versions of the model a more realistic option for firm management to shut down before all equity value was gone was added.<sup><a href=\"#fn44\">44</a></sup> These decision sequences are repeated as period to period (quarter) feed backs, that give the model a nice \u201crecursive\u201d short period structure and reduces the need to estimate artificial lag equations.

In both cases the sum of squared deviations was minimized, in the Taymaz calibration program resulting in a very complex loss function.

The nature of the MOSES model, however, means that the loss function to be minimized is selection based, highly nonlinear and therefore very complex, meaning the risk of plenty of local minima. Since conventional optimization mathematics is of little use, a random search method has been employed to look for <i>robust</i> results in the sense that small variations in parameter values should not significantly change economy wide systems properties. The parameter vector should also be empirically reasonable. The parameter space allowed has therefore been limited on a priori grounds, and it is assumed that it contains the global minimum in its interior. As a first step (<i>global search</i>) parameters are randomly assigned within that parameter space. Since they generate information about the global minimum, the shape of the distance curve and influential parameters the number of searches can be terminated when little further information is gained in the next round.
