This growth process can only be represented by a micro-market-based macro theory and is simulated here on the Swedish micro-to-macro model MOSES. It is found that the impact of the market selection mechanisms operating through entrepreneurial entry, market competition and the enforced exit of underperformers, while slow in the beginning, significantly affect economic growth in the long run. A political economy that is unable to organize itself to wait for the very long-run benefits of significant immediate efforts to enhance firm exit and entry may never experience strong and sustained economic growth.",

He is, however, not as well-known for what he argued was most important of all for the wealth of nations, namely dynamic competition - particularly as maintained by free innovative entry that checks the formation of monopolies detrimental to the creation of economic wealth. Such dynamic competition is made possible by the superior capacity of some firms to compete for customers and resources and is driven by the rewards for that superiority. This superior capacity defines the organizational competence of the temporary monopoly that is called a firm (<a href=\"#bib13\">Eliasson, 1990</a>). Such superior organizational competence is always temporary, since it is relative to the competence of all other firms, and firms are continuously generating new competence through organizational learning and innovation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eliasson, 1992a</a>). One thesis of this paper is that without free innovative entry, rapid long-term growth of an economy cannot be supported. Innovative entry improves the technology level of firms, maintains diversity of production structures, and forces competition on incumbent producers. Costs come in the form of increased exits by low performers, and transactions costs associated with the reallocation of resources.",

The economic question raised here is whether firms can overcome the natural filtering of winners and losers in markets through organizational learning. This paper is concerned with the growth dynamics of this game in what can be called <i>the experimentally organized economy</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Wu et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Eliasson, 1991a</a>). The experimental mode of behavior is fundamental for entrepreneurial activity and economic growth. Individual agents are characterized by strongly bounded rationality and markets by free innovative entry. The latter drives the selection mechanisms in the model that also influence the economic environment, making it largely non-transparent to each agent. Only through curious experimentation will entrepreneurs be able to explore the enormous investment opportunity space of such an experimentally organized economy and discover the superior technologies that can be profitably invested in.",

They are one side of free innovative entry. The other side is regulation, i.e., restrictions on entrepreneurial entry there naturally or imposed politically. Four factors therefore hold back entrepreneurial competition, market selection and economic growth. First, incentives for entrepreneurship may be insufficient, second, the competence to commercialize new technologies may be lacking, third, competition does not compel firms to innovate preemptively to avoid being overrun (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eliasson, 1995</a>), or, fourth, entrepreneurship may be held back by regulation, typically through restrictions on free competitive entry in markets to protect incumbents (<a href=\"#bib15\">Eliasson, 1991b</a>).",

The source of this endogenous entrepreneurial force can be established by demonstrating the existence, theoretically and through simulation, of the vastness of the business opportunity space and the pressure to overcome competition through innovation. In doing that, standard economic theory is linked to the much richer but less rigorously formulated economics of the Austrian school.",

The entire public sector of western market economies is characterized by almost complete prevention of innovative and competitive entry. In Sweden, for instance, only 20 to 30 percent of total production can be said to be subjected to free competition (<a href=\"#bib3\">Carlsson, 1993a</a>). The extreme case is, of course, the formerly planned economies and much of the developing world. The institutions representing competition and market selection are therefore not as typical of western market economics as one may believe. Paradoxically, it is difficult to imagine a true market economy without the widespread presence of such institutions. The institutions preventing market selection from being effective very much reflect the political willingness of societies to accept unpredictable change and their inability to cope with it. And the only way of modelling the macroeconomic importance of those mechanisms is through microsimulation mathematics.",

A rapid reorganization of the model economy, in which competition is driven by endogenous innovative entry, will create immediate negative effects in the form of firm exits and temporary local spells of unpredictable unemployment, while the benefit in the form of additional economic growth will come with a delay. This tradeoff between the immediate future and the long term very much hinges on the flexibility of the labor market. Conversely, the negative consequences at the macro level of constrained entrepreneurial competition will appear after decades, but then with a momentum that might accelerate and require immense policy effort and patience to turn around. This means that a political economy unable to mobilize sufficient patience or political concern to give the very long-term a fair chance against immediate negative effects may never experience growth and/or may never be capable of turning a declining economy around.",

Agents not only choose what to do, but also choose modes of thinking about and deciding what to do. Competition through free new entry therefore exercises a competitive threat to all agents, which they must counter by preventive innovative competition of their own. This dynamic competition moves the entire economy and forces agents not capable of coping to exit. Exits, in retrospect, will then appear at the macroeconomic level as a standard cost of economic growth. If this cost is not incurred, it is synonymous with the absence of market competition through innovative new establishment and of economic growth (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eliasson, 1994</a>).",

For growth to occur, superior firms will have to be constantly attempting to explore the investment opportunities space.

The model assumes that firms face such a varied menu of economic choices as to make fully informed decisions at the micro level impossible. Under such circumstances, decisions must generally be characterized by <i>bounded rationality</i> in the sense of Herbert Simon. Bounded rationality in a complex economic environment also defines the competence of agents in markets to make successful business decisions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Eliasson, 1990</a>). If this competence is accumulated through organizational learning in heterogeneous environments (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eliasson, 1992a</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ballot et al., 1993</a>), the \u201ccompetence capital\u201d becomes extremely heterogeneous.

The exit of low performers is a divestment that makes room for the expansion of high performers, not in the least through releasing labor and competence at reasonable costs. The productivity effects of exit are immediate, while reorganization and rationalization investments quickly affect growth. In fact, most of the growth inducements in Swedish industry of the 1980s came through the reorganization and rationalization of existing firms.",

Innovative entry works in the very long run. It is typically experimental, with the average performance of entrants being lower rather than higher than that of the average incumbent (<a href=\"#bib15\">Eliasson, 1991b</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Granstrand, 1986</a>) but the spread being much wider. Hence, the exit rate among new entrants is very high. In a viable market economy firms have to learn to live with (1) the exit of incumbents forced by the successful entry of others, (2) the high failure rate of entrants, and (3) the long waiting time needed to see the few successes mature and grow sufficiently to influence macroeconomic behavior.

To filter out enough success stories through competition to move long-term growth, therefore, significant resources are used up through more or less mistaken business decisions. In fact, at the macro level, <i>a significant rate of business failure should be viewed as a standard cost for economic development</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eliasson, 1992a</a>).",

All experiments were run by quarter over 50 years, and were compared to a reference run based on the parameter setting calibrated on data from the Swedish economy as described in <a href=\"#bib24\">Taymaz (1991)</a> and <a href=\"#bib26\">Taymaz (1993)</a>.",

After this, manufacturing output grows much more quickly than under the base scenario and is more than 50 per cent higher after 50 years. The average difference in the growth rate in Experiment I is on average almost one per cent per year and slowly increasing,<a href=\"#fn2\"><sup>2</sup></a> as surviving new high productivity firms grow while low performance firms contract or exit because of more intense competition (<a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a>). In Experiment II, when exit is slowed down relative to the base run, some improvement in output growth is seen for the first 20 years or so (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), then development falls behind the base run. The explanation is simple. First, slack is initially used more efficiently, even though low productivity facilities are kept going that were forced to exit in Experiment I. After a while, diminished competition, due to the absence of competitive entry, makes factor costs increase and affect overall growth negatively. This negative development, however, takes some 20 years or more to become statistically visible. After 20 years or so, higher factor costs reduce investment incentives in expanding industries and the overall macro effect turns negative. The development of GNP is about parallel (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).",

Solid black columns denote firms from the initial year that have survived through the fifty year simulation. The width of the column measures the percentage of total industry capital (valued at current prices) and employmenty respectively on the horizing represented by the surviving firms.Rather well\u00ad behaved productivity and rate of return distributions are recorded on the 50-year horizon. It is interesting to observe that while old (initial) and new firms are well distributed over the entire range, new entrants dominate in the upper, high left end of the rate of return distribution (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Old incumbents from the initial year (black columns) apparently have stayed relatively productive, but are not well represented on on the horizon among the top rate of return performers. This should be the case (<a href=\"#bib15\">Eliasson, 1991b</a>) but apparently, and very much in keeping with the hypothesis of the experimentally organized economy, high labor productivity is not necessarily the same thing as high rate of return performance. Thus, while the most productive firms after 50 years are new entrants, some of the original firms also have high labor productivity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). When rate of return distributions on the 50-year horizon are compared in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, the distorted distribution in the no entry and slow exit experiments comes out clearly. As observed in <a href=\"#bib10\">Eliasson (1984)</a>, such shapes make the industrial structure exposed to changes in the competitive situation, or of the interest rate. A sudden jump in the interest rate can knock out the bulk of the industrial structure in the base and slow exit cases, if the increase is large (as it was several times in the 1970s).<a href=\"#fn3\"><sup>3</sup></a>",

When profitable firms want to expand, they can outbid the large number of depressed firms in the low tail end in wages and interest rates, and suddenly force many of them to exit. As can be seen, not much of an increase in interest rates is needed to make some three quarters of capital owners less concerned about staying in business. The entry experiment I shows a much smoother performance distribution on the horizon and less cause for disruptive behavior in the price system (<a href=\"#bib9\">Eliasson, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Eliasson, 1984</a>).",
