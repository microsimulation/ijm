                "text": "Austrian consumer prices rose by 8.6% in 2022, followed by a 7.8% increase in 2023, with projections indicating a 4.0% rise in 2024. In response, the Austrian government introduced various support measures targeted at households, amounting to between 1.3% and 1.6% of GDP per year from 2022 to 2024. We use the tax-benefit microsimulation model EUROMOD and statistically matched data from the Household Budget Survey to analyse the effects on disposable income and expenditures. Households with lower income are on average more heavily affected by inflation, primarily because of their higher average propensity to consume. In total, relief is disproportionally allocated to the upper half of the income distribution in absolute terms, but relative to income it is higher in the lower deciles. Together with nominal increases in other sources of income, on average, households receive enough income to cover their additional expenditures. However, as there is significant heterogeneity across households, this result does not hold for all households, particularly not for those in the lower parts of the income distribution.",

We obtain changes in disposable income for 2022, 2023, and 2024 with respect to the reference year 2021, and compare them with expenditure changes over the same period. Income changes result from inflation relief measures, the implementation of an eco-social tax reform during this period, and from other income changes, such as increases in wages and social transfers, which are basically indexed to the lagged inflation rate. The rise in expenditures is measured as the additional amount necessary to afford the same consumption basket after the rise of consumer prices. As we abstract from behavioural responses, the measured inflation burden can be interpreted as an upper bound for the welfare cost. Both income and expenditure changes are obtained for different parts of the income distribution. This analysis enables us to assess whether government measures are sufficient to compensate households, on average, for their increased consumption costs in different parts of the income spectrum.",

In total, in 2023, annual inflation rates decreased slightly with increasing income, spanning from 7.2% in the ninth decile to 7.9% in the first decile. For 2024, using the forecast from December 2023, no substantial differences between average inflation rates in the deciles are expected. They range from 3.4% to 3.7%. In summary, while there is some heterogeneity across households, differences between average inflation rates across deciles of the income distribution are small compared to the variation in inflation over time. Hence, it is average inflation that dominates the results when calculating the burden of inflation. Differences in inflation rates between deciles play a minor role in these years (see Section 5.2 for a decomposition of the inflation burden).",

In 2022, persons in the lower deciles received a higher inflation relief per capita, not only in relative but also in absolute terms. In 2023 and 2024, the indexation of income tax brackets favours high earners more in absolute terms. In those years, the higher relative relief in the lower deciles is due to the denominator effect arising from their lower disposable incomes. Similarly, the eco-social tax reform favours high-income earners more in absolute terms but leads to higher relative increases in disposable income for low-income households. In contrast, the estimated residual of other income changes tends to increase income in the upper deciles by more, even in a relative sense. This result is explained by income from employment being more important in the higher deciles and by expected wage growth per person being stronger than the growth of transfers. An additional factor especially in the top decile is investment income, which was comparably low in 2021 and grew strongly in 2022.<a href=\"#fn14\"><sup>14</sup></a>",

Even though we do take account of different consumption baskets, the burden is roughly proportional to consumption and heterogeneous inflation rates play a minor role (see discussion in the next subsection). As a result, the increase with income in absolute terms mostly reflects higher consumption levels of higher-income households. The decrease of the burden relative to disposable income in the higher deciles reflects average propensities to consume that are decreasing with income. In the lower parts of the income distribution, the average propensities to consume are larger than one (negative saving), which drives the result that income increases are not sufficient to cover expenditure increases in 2023 and 2024 in the bottom decile. Price reducing measures only played a minor role in 2022 and are most important in 2023. Their relief volume is distributed relatively equally across deciles, such that the relief per capita is similar. Relative to disposable income this results in a higher relief for low-income households, on average.",

On average, across all households, the surplus is around \u20ac1,230 per person or 5.5% of equivalised disposable income. As the income relief becomes less progressive in 2024 (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and wages grow faster than pensions, there is still an estimated gap in the first decile.
