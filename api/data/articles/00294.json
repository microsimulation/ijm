The effects on investment from faster than economically motivated fiscal depreciation schemes now prevalent in most industrial nations can be expressed in at least two different ways. Speeded up fiscal write offs create hidden tax credits that can be regarded as interest free borrowing. Since there is no alternative because of the tax wedge, the cost of capital is lowered. Hence, borrowing and more investment will be economically motivated. Alternatively one can say that the firm lowers its cut off rate on the margin until expected returns to investment meet the marginal supply price of funds. This in turn is dependent on the expected return to the investment itself since there are no other competing alternatives due to the tax wedge. In a neoclassical, static equilibrium setting the two formulations come to the same, since the rate of return requirement appears in the cost of capital expression and is equal ex ante and ex post. The rate of return is lowered ex post as firms increase investments each period.",

We have consistently found that if shocks, positive or negative, are large and sudden enough, they disturb market price signaling and lead to mistaken expectations, investments and production plans which cause lasting damage in the form of lost growth. This has helped to clarify the restrictive nature of traditional equilibrium models when it comes to understanding the longer term. It is interesting to notice that pushing the economy too fast, too far towards short term optimum performance (call it \u201cshort term equilibrium like\u201d market conditions) tends to produce disorderly markets, reduce price predictability and cause systems instabilities and long term losses in output.

A brief period with high prices and profits often changes into wage drift and a cost crisis that takes years to correct if the initial disturbance was strong enough. Firms grow cautious and investments are hurt.

The relative cyclical price improvement in 1973/74 is however removed in this case. The deteriorating competitive situation cuts into profits fast and reduces the investment misallocations stimulated by past profits. (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2, 5A and E</a>). The raw materials industry gradually fades away over some 10 years. With a slower fiscal write-off, investment in the raw material industry is curtailed faster. The waste of investment resources in the raw material industry due to generous fiscal write-offs, however, does not seem to mean much economy wide - contrary to the traditional view. Generous fiscal write-offs help the expanding engineering industry even more in the longer (beyond 5 year) run and this can be most clearly seen in both total and relative investment and output levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A\u20135A</a>).",

In fact, looking at the first 10 years only suggests that there are no effects. By tightening fiscal depreciation rules investment can be reduced by 25% with no loss in output during the first 10 years. Even more important, however, seems to be that expanding firms in the engineering industry do not grow as fast because of less generous fiscal stimulus. One may perhaps conclude that long run dynamic efficiency has not improved, or that a tight fiscal policy vis-a-vis firms has raised the discount rate and shortened the planning horizon, with less growth long run growth as a consequence. As in the A series of experiments, accelerated fiscal write-offs also here lower the real rate of return on total assets in the long run -and vice versa. This is, however, not the whole thing.

Earlier, the expanding engineering industry had not been able to employ people at the rate desired without pushing up wages at the expense of its own profitability. With several large raw material producing firms leaving the market, labor is however freed for employment in the engineering sector. These firms take off at a fast rate and at general wage increases that are low enough not to eliminate the incentives to invest and grow, as was the case in the A-series. The importance of strong competition between the \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cnew\u201d industries in factor markets is illustrated in a \u201cSchumpeterian fashion\u201d. Output shoots above the base case in the second decade of the simulation. (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A and 4</a> and <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>). The total allocation effect hence is very large, and this simulation illustrates that the waste caused by even large mistaken investments decisions may be small or negligible. <i>The large social and private costs are incurred when production continues in the inferior manufacturing plants. Labor is locked in there at market wages, which the plant is able to pay as it runs down its equity gradually at a return slightly above current costs. A somewhat higher overall wage level than otherwise is maintained and expanding firms cannot recruit workers without offering large wage incereases that generate a wage drift accross the market which even endangers their own expansion plans.</i> This deprives the entire economy of a larger output from the same labor elsewhere. If so, a fast deterioration of the competitive position of such firms, to the extent that they are forced to shut down, will produce a higher \u201csocial return\u201d than a gradual deterioration that allows inferior firms to keep producing until they fade away, due to dwindling financial resources to invest.",

The labor market search pattern and wage response parameters of labor and firms allow realistic wage level differentiation to develop between firms in those simulations that best capture postwar Swedish economic development. This may be interpreted as partly due to labor immobility because of geographical distance. If unemployed workers were 100 percent deprived of income, they certainly would move to a job offered.",

Workers move voluntarily when offered a wage higher than his/her reservation wage. The objection then is not really that geographical distance suggests other, higher reservation wages, they can be changed in a new series of experiments if somebody comes up with better empirical information than we have. The point is that if workers do not move in response to market incentives to accomplish together a more efficient allocation they have been stimulated to stay where they are by a combination of taxes, subsidies and unemployment benefits. The allocation in the experiments reported here has been accomplished on a parameter specification that seems to be quite good for the post\u00ad war Swedish economy.

Stability in the market price system and of total economic development was increased. However, a typical characteristic of the Micro-Macro model is that when price change gets faster and stronger, feedback effects through the entire economy may create a different type of instability. If the production structure cannot adjust fast enough, the speeded up adjustment may make market prices irregular, jumpy and difficult to interpret by the firms. In earlier versions of the model, loaded only with synthetic firms, interfirm variation in productivity was very small. There was so to speak only a very thin Salter tail of relatively low performing firms. Almost an entire industry might be forced to close down over a few years because of a sudden relative price change.

In the earlier experiments relatively profitable raw material producers locked up labor resources and kept engineering firms from expanding during the first half of the simulation period. Now tight fiscal rules have kept raw material producing firms from expanding during that period. When the market turns decisively in favor of engineering industry from 1974 and onwards, there is enough labor for firms to expand without strong wage drift. With more generous fiscal depreciation rules they expand employment so heavily that they drive up wages to such an extent that two additional raw material producers find it in their interest to close down. The result is a higher total output throughout the 20 year period than in all other experiments and in particular during the second 10 year period. There obviously cannot be a simple one-to-one correspondence he tween profitability and growth at the macro level. The reallocation of resources between firms that enhances output reduces rates of return in high performance, rapidly expanding firms and vice versa, leaving very little of stability in any macro relationship one might want to estimate.",

However, the most striking feature is the clustering of firms into two separate groups with entirely different performance characteristics. Almost all high-profit units lower their before-tax rate of return as a result of the more generous depreciation rules, while the low-profit units do the reverse. In fact, we are presented with an explanation for the drop in profitability in engineering industries observed in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. The reason is a combination of reduced slack and a contraction of output growth to a relatively more efficient and profitable production range of the firms as a result of more competition. Part of this is reflected in a migration of workers from raw material firms into expanding engineering firms. This final observation illustrates one important feature of the growth process, namely that growth itself affects factor prices so that they tilt against the growing firms. Endogenous factor price feedback so to speak operates as a \u201cgrowth cost factor\u201d that increases faster than proportionally to growth. It is then also easy to see that artificial price wedges (like taxes and subsidies) will reinforce that mechanism, slowing down both resource reallocations and growth, through increasing the cost of growth. In other words, speeding up reallocation of resources to raise growth through raising incentives and/or speeding up markets are frustrated by a policy created countervailing increase in the costs for growth.",

They may be \u201creal economic\u201cinconsistencies due to markets failing to clear or plans of firm that do not match demands for products or available inputs. These are circumstances the consequences of which we are interested in studying. But there are also unwanted statistical inconsistencies in the data on which the model runs, notably in its initial state, for instance (1) between the exogenous export prices and those of national accounts statistics, and/or (2) between the input output structure and the composition of total demand as calculated by the model. Some of the problems of making technical data in official macro data bases compatible with those in firm data bases in <a href=\"#bib4\">Carlsson and Olavi (1978)</a>. Outright statistical errors we don\u2019t want, which emphasizes the importance of good quality statistical measurement for these types of initial state dependent models. But even so, in a model that runs on more or less informed decisions of market actors some of these data imperfections are real circumstances that affect economy wide behavior and an important part of the analysis. On this score we are looking forward to the implementation of a new micro-firm data base that should improve things considerably.",
