                "text": "Over the past several decades, the United States has experienced a dramatic rise in obesity rates, due to both a rightward shift of the body mass index (BMI) distribution and a pushing out of the right tail. This shift has led to increases in obesity-related chronic diseases, particularly diabetes, as well as impacts on longevity, medical expenditures, and quality of life. Microsimulation modeling is a potentially useful tool for assessing the impacts of policies targeting this epidemic, but reliably assessing policies requires a model that performs well in projecting health risk factors and disease outcomes. This research assesses the out-of-sample and external validity of a microsimulation model of the U.S. adult population.",

For this validation exercise, all Markov transition models are estimated using the 1999-2007 waves of the PSID. The simulation is then run from 2007-2017. For internal consistency, simulated outcomes in 2017 are compared to actual PSID outcomes. Population means and selected quantiles are compared between the simulation and the host data. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are used to assess model performance for binary outcomes using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic. For external validation, simulated outcomes for 2007-2017 are compared to the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS), a large, nationally-representative survey of the United States population.",

The 99th percentile differs significantly, with FAM underestimating the right tail of the BMI distribution. Individual assignment of obesity and severe obesity performs well using AUC as a criteria. Initial differences in the diabetes prevalence between PSID and BRFSS data are preserved in FAM projections. FAM is initially 1.9 percentage points below BRFSS for women 25 and older and is 1.6 percentage points below BRFSS for women 35 and older after ten years of simulation. Men 25 and older are 1.2 percentage points lower initially and are 0.8 percentage points lower after ten years of simulation. Individual assignment of diabetes incidence does not perform as well as clinical models with richer predictors. Researchers using FAM should be cognizant of these strengths and limitations of the microsimulation model.",

During the same time period, the severely obese prevalence (BMI over 40) increased from 2.8% to 7.7%. Comorbidities associated with obesity, such as diabetes, have also increased (<a href=\"#bib6\">Menke et al., 2015</a>). These increases impact both individuals and society through many pathways, including the direct health impacts (chronic conditions, functional limitations, and mortality), increased medical expenditures and utilization, other economic impacts (changes in employment, disability), and declines in subjective well-being.",

These strategies, in turn, are often implemented on a small scale or within a randomized control trial. To translate the effects to a larger scale analysts increasingly turn to microsimulation models, as these models can account for heterogeneous individuals and treatment effects. To do this credibly requires a microsimulation model that performs well, but also one where the limitations are clearly conveyed. With respect to body mass index, a model that performs well needs to project not just the mean BMI well, but also capture the distribution, as policies often target those in the right tail, such as the obese or severely obese. This is not an uncommon requirement for microsimulation models, as the distribution of continuous variables is often relevant to policy questions. Though often assumed to be \u2018\u2018black boxes\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018crystal balls\u2019\u2019 for projecting the future, validation of past-performance and transparency about limitations can avoid overselling the capabilities of these models while better informing policy decisions.",

The host data for the simulation is the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), a biennial panel survey which collects information on a broad set of health and economic outcomes for approximately 15,000 respondents per year(<a href=\"#bib5\">McGonagle et al., 2012</a>). While the PSID is designed to be nationally representative, it does face the challenges all longitudinal surveys do, such as imperfect response rate and sample attrition. We typically use PSID data from 1999-2017 as the basis for FAM. These data are used to estimate transition functions and as the initial data for the simulation. The first-order Markov transition models are the engine used in \u2018\u2018aging\u2019\u2019 the simulants. The transitions are a mixture of continuous, binary, and categorical outcomes, with a time-scale that mimics the two-year structure of the data. FAM simulates dozens of variables for individuals, including health risk factors, chronic conditions, functional limitations, mortality, life events, economic outcomes, medical cost and use, and government transfers. The causal pathway of FAM is that health risk factors (such as body-mass index and smoking) impact health outcomes (such as diabetes incidence or the number of functional limitations), which in turn impact a set of economic outcomes (such as medical expenditures, retirement).",

Similar challenges face measures of chronic conditions, though chronic conditions are more challenging to assess in an interview setting. Administrative medical claims are not a panacea, as they have their own challenges (<a href=\"#bib2\">Clair et al., 2017</a>) . With that said, the measures used in FAM are commonly used in surveys such as PSID, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), the National Health Interview Survey, and others. Though they do not provide the true population prevalence of chronic conditions or BMI distribution, they are still useful in many ways.

Time-varying predictors enter as two-year lagged variables. One can think of the interpretation of this model as a percent change in BMI over a two-year period. Within the simulation, a random draw from the root-mean square error term of this model adds a stochastic element. BMI appears in other transitions either in logs or in clinically-relevant BMI categories (under 25, 25 to 30, 30 to 35, 35 to 40, or over 40).",

For men, projected mean BMI is 28.5 in FAM, 28.3 for PSID. Most percentiles also compare well, with overlapping confidence intervals. In the right tail, such as at the 95th and 99th percentile, FAM and the PSID begin to deviate. At the 99th percentile, the FAM projection is 3.6 BMI points lower than the PSID value. For men, we see a similar story, though the discrepancy is around 4.2 BMI points at the 99th percentile. This suggests that the 1999-2007 data used for estimating the transition models did not accurately capture the continual expansion of the very high BMI population in the US.",

This is possibly a consequence of not projecting the right-tail of the BMI distribution. Alternatively, it could be changing diagnostic practices in the US between 2007 and 2017.

In this analysis, each 2007 PSID respondent is simulated 5,000 times (50 sets of bootstrapped transition models, each with 100 Monte Carlo replications). For the outcome of interest, the fraction of simulations that resulted in that outcome is calculated. All simulants are ordered, smallest to largest, by these fractions. At each level of the fraction, the ROC analysis compares to the observed outcome for the individuals in the PSID survey data, assessing the true positive rate and false positive rate. The ROC analysis then shows the trade-off between \u2018\u2018true positives\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018false negatives\u2019\u2019 for different thresholds of predicted prevalence after ten years. We assess four outcomes: having a BMI under 25, having a BMI over 30, having a BMI over 40, and 10-year incident diabetes for those who did not have diabetes in 2007. A performance parameter is the \u2018\u2018area under the curve\u2019\u2019 (AUC in the figures). Interpretation of the value of the AUC statistic varies by context. An AUC of 1.0 is perfect classification, 0.5 is no better than random chance.",
