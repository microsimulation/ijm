It is perhaps best described as a one-day retrospective interviewer administered diary. The basic idea is that the in\u00adterviewer goes through the past 24 hours with the respondent and asks him or her to recall for each activity when it started and ended. One advantage of this method is that it forces the respondent to have the time-use of all activities to add up to 24 hours. Furthermore, with one day retrospective questions, the data collection does not interfere with the observed activities and the recall error is reduced as much as possible. Contributing to our decision not to try other methods were the results of a few comparisons made in Michigan with the so-called beeper technique, i.e. each respondent was equipped with a beeper and, when it gave a signal at ran\u00addom time intervals, the respondent made a note about his (her) present activity.

Retrospective questions are also burdened by underre\u00adporting. In our pretest a new method was tried. Each reported activity in the time\u00ad use interview was followed by questions about any expenditures the respondent might have had while doing the activity. The approach to ask jointly about expenditures and time-use might be less burdened by underreporting, since the questions link the expenditures to certain activities. This should make it easier for the re\u00adspondent to remember both expenditures and activities. One problem is, however, that it is not practical to ask, if there was an expenditure for every activity.
