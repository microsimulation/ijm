Our results show that the elimination of the export tax would have different long run effects depending on the fiscal instrument that is used by the government to compensate for the loss in tax revenue. On the one hand, when the government budget is balanced by decreased savings, the average annual growth rate for 2008\u20132015 is lower than in the baseline scenario. On the other hand, when the government budget is balanced by an increased direct tax rate, there is a long-run positive effect on growth. In all cases, the employment level is lower and the price of food items is higher. Therefore, the poverty headcount ratio increases. As expected, a reduction in the world price of food items (i.e., a worsening in Argentina\u2019s terms of trade) would impact negatively on the country\u2019s GDP growth rate and poverty, particularly in the rural areas.",

A severe macroeconomic crisis in the mid-1970s under the Peronist administration was followed by some structural reforms carried out by the military regime. The debt crisis of the early 1980s then hit the Argentinean economy, which entered a phase of deep recession. The lost decade of the 1980s, characterized by poor economic performance, ended with a major macroeconomic crisis, including two episodes of hyperinflation in 1989 and 1990. The Peronist administration that took power in 1989 introduced a wide range of macro and market-based reforms in the early 1990s. However, despite an impressive macroeconomic record, the social situation significantly deteriorated. The 1990s ended with another recession, which was followed by a major breakdown; the 2001/02 crisis implied a fall in GDP of more than 15 percent, a 200 percent devaluation of the exchange rate, public debt default, restrictions on withdrawing bank deposits, 40.5 percent inflation during 2002, an increase in the unemployment rate to 24 percent, and an increase in the poverty rate to 54.3 percent in 2003. The economy strongly recovered during the 2000s, reaching levels of activity similar to those in the 1990s and a poverty rate of 27 percent in 2006.",

In the short run, a fall in GDP is observed, which can be accounted for by several factors. When the export tax is eliminated, the sectors with the highest tax rates expand their production level (see below). As was shown, these sectors are, in relation to the rest of the economy, relatively capital-intensive (particularly in land). Consequently, when expanded, they cannot absorb all the labor \u2013 specifically semi-skilled and skilled labor \u2013 that is expelled by the sectors that are contracting, and consequently urban unemployment increases at the same time that rural unemployment decreases (see <a href=\"#table6\">Table 6</a>); at the national level however, total unemployment increases.<sup><a href=\"#fn18\">18</a></sup> Additionally, a fall in the national labor supply is observed, particularly when government savings and public consumption are used to balance the government budget. The decrease in the participation rate combined with the increase in the urban unemployment rate impact negatively on poverty (see <a href=\"#table9\">Table 9</a>) On the other hand, the increase in the returns to the land, combined with the reduction in the rural unemployment rate, reduce rural poverty which, according to the scarce available evidence, is higher than urban poverty.<sup><a href=\"#fn19\">19</a></sup> Overall, national poverty increases since the number of households escaping poverty in the rural areas does not compensate for the number of households entering poverty in the urban areas; recall that (1) the share of urban areas in Argentina is 87.1 percent, and (2) the baseline unemployment rate is higher in urban areas (see <a href=\"#table6\">Table 6</a>).",

However, when government financing is through debt, there is a fall in investment that reduces the economy\u2019s growth rate throughout the simulation period.

At the same time, the effect of rising primary exports is an appreciation of the real exchange rate, which undermines the competitiveness of other agricultural and manufacturing exports (see <a href=\"#table8\">Table 8</a>). A significant change in the sectoral composition of Argentina\u2019s economic structure can be observed. In particular, both production and exports turn towards primary products. At the same time, imports of manufactures increase, replacing domestic production. Argentina\u2019s productive structure is thus modified with primary products such as cereals, oil seeds, oil, and vegetable oils and fats gaining importance.",

We found that the elimination of the export tax would have different long run effects depending on the fiscal instrument that is used by the government to compensate for the loss in tax revenue.

On the other hand, when the government budget is balanced by an increased direct tax rate, there is a long- run positive effect on growth.

Note that a certain sequence must be assumed regarding how different dimensions of aggregate labor market changes (e.g., changes in unemployment rates). Consequently, as with other microsimulation approaches, a problem of path dependence can be present. However, we can justify the logic of the followed sequence on the basis of plausible labor market behavior and as long as the size of the simulated shifts is not very large (see <a href=\"#bib41\">Vos and Sanchez, 2010</a>).",
