                "text": "Simulation modelling is a powerful tool for assessing the impact of diseases and guiding healthcare policy decisions. This paper introduces AUS-OA, a dynamic discrete time microsimulation model of osteoarthritis and its treatment in Australia. AUS-OA aims to provide policy makers and researchers with increased capacity to evaluate the burden and treatment of osteoarthritis across Australia. AUS-OA uses a synthetic base population of individuals with age, sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), osteoarthritis and other attributes weighted to the Australian population. Body mass index, osteoarthritis incidence and progression, primary and revision joint replacement are modelled over time based on econometric equations derived from linked and longitudinal data. Costs and health-related quality of life outcomes are then assigned based on an individual\u2019s health conditions and treatments. AUS-OA is calibrated with observed data between 2013 and 2022. Base case and \u2018what-if\u2019 scenarios can then be simulated from 2023. For an initial application, AUS-OA was used for an economic evaluation of a decision support tool, SMART Choice, that improves patient selection into surgery. Comparisons of univariate and bivariate distributions across key population attributions such as BMI, osteoarthritis and joint replacement between the synthetic and actual populations highlight that the AUS-OA model accurately reflects the Australian population over the calibration period. The evaluation of the SMART Choice decision support tool highlighted that the tool is cost-effective. AUS-OA provides a robust analytical framework for evaluating the long-term, population-level impact of osteoarthritis and its treatments.",

In Australia, people with osteoarthritis are almost twice as likely to rate their health as \u2018fair\u2019 to \u2018poor\u2019, and to report \u2018moderate\u2019 to \u2018very severe\u2019 bodily pain compared to those without the condition (<a href=\"#bib1\">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2023</a>). Federal government spending on osteoarthritis reached $4.3 billion in 2020-21, or 2.9% of total spending on healthcare (<a href=\"#bib1\">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2023</a>), and is expected to continue grow rapidly to 2030 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ackerman et al., 2019</a>). Substantial effort is being made to reduce the health and economic burden of osteoarthritis, including the development of new streamlined models of care (<a href=\"#bib3\">Minister for Health et al., 2023</a>), community-based lifestyle interventions to reduce the need for end-stage surgeries (<a href=\"#bib4\">The University of Sydney, 2023</a>), and trials to investigate the use of stem-cell therapies to avoid the progression of osteoarthritis altogether (<a href=\"#bib5\">Watkins, 2022</a>). However, the epidemiology of osteoarthritis is complex and progresses over a lifetime, while population demographics and behaviours are changing over time. It is a major challenge to extrapolate the results from clinical trials and quasi-experimental studies to broader, long-term population outcomes, to understand which interventions are effective and cost-effective.",

Its advantages include the ability to model the social determinants of health and disease progression over a patient\u2019s lifetime, and to capture the heterogeneity of a population within a systematic analytical framework (<a href=\"#bib7\">Zucchelli et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Kopasker et al., 2023</a>). Complex population trends can be modelled by a series of relatively simple equations at the individual level, such as how the progression of osteoarthritis varies depending on age, gender and/or Body Mass Index (BMI). New policies and models of care can be evaluated by changing inputs into the model, and sensitivity analyses can be completed to test the robustness of the results.",

Each year, new agents enter the model at age 45, while existing agents in the model grow older, experience a change in BMI, acquire comorbidities, potentially develop osteoarthritis or experience it worsen, seek treatments such as pain relief or total joint replacement, and in some cases, die. Health service utilisation and costs, and health-related quality of life, are then evaluated based on the individual agent\u2019s attributes, health conditions, and treatments. Presently, the focus of AUS-OA is osteoarthritis of the knee, but the model has the capacity to be adapted to include other bodily sites.

Base case projections and \u2018what-if\u2019 scenarios can then be simulated for up to 30 years from 2023 until 2053, to evaluate the impact of socio-demographic trends, changes in costs or advances in osteoarthritis treatment and models of care.

For AUS-OA, we have conducted a systematic set of validation exercises to build trust in the model. First, internal validation was conducted by reproducing the model in two software languages: R and Matlab, and by two coders, and comparing simulation outputs. A range of shocks were imposed in the model and results tested to confirm that AUS-OA was working as expected. For example, a sharp increase in BMI was modelled, to confirm that an increase in a key risk factor for osteoarthritis led to higher rate of disease incidence and progression; higher rates of osteoarthritis progression were tested to confirm that the AUS-OA then predicted a higher rate of TKR.",

We compare costs and HRQOL outcomes under a scenario where 3 per cent (sensitivity test 1 and 5 per cent) of those with osteoarthritis and a preference for surgery use SMART Choice, versus the status quo baseline without SMART Choice. The mechanism through which the tool delivers benefit is by improving the mix of patients receiving TKRs. The impact of SMART Choice is modelled by applying the odds ratio observed in the trial to the rate of surgeries in those unlikely to benefit (<a href=\"#bib36\">Zhou et al., 2024</a>). The decision support tool is not an active treatment that would be expected to alter the progression of osteoarthritis, and there are large waiting lists for surgery, so it is unlikely to reduce overall numbers of TKR in any given year. We therefore offset the lower rates of TKR in those unlikely to benefit by an increase in the rate of TKRs for those likely to benefit. The costs of SMART Choice are largely sunk in the development of the web-based tool, however we consider annual operational costs of $150,000 to cover website hosting and maintenance. We compute an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) and assess cost-effectiveness relative to a common threshold of $50,000 per QALY (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wang et al., 2018</a>). We simulate the analysis 100 times over 10 years, discounting both costs and HRQOL outcomes at 5 per cent.",

On average, the results suggest that SMART Choice delivers an increase in population QALYs because of improved patient selection into surgery, resulting in a highly cost-effective ICER of $243 per QALY. Note that the incremental costs are lower than the direct costs of the intervention as the improved patient mix also results in reduced costs due to lower rates of complications and inpatient rehabilitation. In sensitivity analysis, the ICER falls to $84 per QALY if 5 per cent of the surgical population use SMART Choice; conversely the ICER increases to $1,039 if only 1 per cent use it.",

There is also uncertainty in the population trends for key variables, and bias in the self-reported BMI data for HILDA and the 2022 NHS, which moved to self-report post pandemic. Both BMI distributions and osteoarthritis prevalence rates have tended to fluctuate in the national survey data over the last decade. We have provided a range of validation graphs to highlight how AUS-OA compares to observed population results, but there is uncertainty as to how accurate our baseline projections will be. We note that AUS-OA overestimates the prevalence of osteoarthritis relative to the 2022 health survey, and as a result, economic evaluations of interventions targeting this older cohort may overestimate the size of the population, and potentially the benefit form the intervention.",
