The comments and support from the microsimulation community have been received during the European workshop on dynamic microsimulation modelling in Brussels (2010) and also during the 3<sup>rd</sup> General Conference of the International Microsimulation Association in Stockholm (2011).

During the last decade, microsimulation as an analytical technique has become increasingly popular in scientific as well as policy-supporting research, particularly in Europe, but also in Australia, Canada and the USA. Specifically for the microsimulation of social security systems, this development has had a strong European dimension. Whereas the decision to set up the Economic Policy Committee to assess the budgetary costs of ageing was taken in 1974, it was the Amsterdam Treaty of November 1997 that introduced the fight against social exclusion as a priority field in which Europe should not stand idle. It probably would go too far to state that the Indicator Subgroup (ISG) of the Social Protection Committee (SPC) has given microsimulation a new lease of life, but it has never ceased to mention its importance in the Open Method of Coordination on pensions,<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> and the two Madrid meetings (2008 and 2010 \u2013 see footnote 6 later in this paper) cumulating in the PROGRESS project call (see footnote 7 later in this text), certainly was a step forward in the right direction.",

First of all, the dynamic model MIDAS was developed using the LIAM system (<a href=\"#bib6\">O'Donoghue, 2010</a>) for Belgium, Germany and Italy within the Framework Programme 6 project, called AIM.

The Brussels \u201cInternational Workshop on Dynamic Microsimulation modelling\u201d (see footnote 3), will serve as an example of such short-scale and informative meetings. The Brussels workshop was an informal gathering of specialists, and digressed from \u2018traditional\u2019 presentations of work completed, but explicitly welcomed the presentation of work in progress, or even presentations pertaining to work yet to start. This way, those less experienced in their capability of microsimulation modelling had the opportunity to discuss their work in front of an experienced audience and in an atmosphere viewed as encouraging and constructive. Besides, the Brussels workshop was highly specialized, but at the same time broad in terms of subjects covered. The programme included not just the work conventional tax-benefit models, but it also covered estimation issues, agent-based modelling, validation and traffic modelling issues. The next workshop of this sort is scheduled for 2012, and we hope for it to be hosted by TEAGASC, in Dublin, which will be another occasion to revive the network EURODYM.",

This may seem trivial for those working in the academic sphere, but there are plenty of semi-public organisations that do not have a working paper series, or where the existing working paper series is intended only for non-technical audiences. The EURODYM will seek to complement these channels by publishing papers intended for a technical audience, papers that are more interesting to those working on technical aspects of microsimulation models. Furthermore, the exchanges would be broader than papers alone, and will also include (heuristic) codes.",

In a later stage, the network could serve as a platform for applying to Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowships (EIF), Marie Curie Incoming International Fellowships, or European Cooperation in the field of Scientific and Technical Research (COSTs) projects. During the Brussels workshop, a related task was proposed, being the organization of a 5-day summer school, discussing static and dynamic microsimulation and covering a theme (say, pensions or tax-benefits models). It could also discuss the use of statistics (e.g. probabilistic modelling on the basis of regressions) in microsimulation. Finally, the network could seek to implement training facilities through online course and other modern means of communication.",

In the short run, the network seeks to support the work in European countries by collaboration, exchange and information sharing. As soon as a suitable opportunity arises, however, one important role will also be to serve as a platform to bid for European research and networking funds and extend further the scope of the network. At this early stage, the network idea requires comments, ideas, criticisms and encouragements from the microsimulation community, which we look forward to receive in making the network take off and serve you more effectively.",
