Indeed, the financial system is well suited for a representation with basic network theory, in which nodes represent institutions and links represent relations (credit and liabilities, derivatives\u2026), as explained, for instance, in <a href=\"#bib56\">Shleifer and Vishny (2010)</a>. In particular, the direct contagion risk can be accurately analysed using a directed and weighted multi-layer network, while the fire sale mechanism can be well approximated starting from a bipartite and weighted multi-layer network of common exposures. In other words, three of the four mechanisms explained above are due to the network of mutual exposures; only bank runs could develop without network relations. Consequently, researchers and policy makers at central banks are becoming more and more interested in network analysis, supporting network-related research.<a href=\"#fn3\"><sup>3</sup></a> The importance of network theory for systemic risk measures is highlighted by <a href=\"#bib49\">Neveu (2016)</a>, who performs a survey of systemic risk literature based on the network approach (previous surveys of the literature on contagion in financial networks are <a href=\"#bib21\">Cabrales et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Glasserman and Young, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">H\u00fcser, 2015</a>). Most network theory papers on the financial system focus specifically on the interbank credit market (but there are papers also on firm-bank credit relationship, such as <a href=\"#bib7\">Bargigli et al., 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bargigli et al., 2018</a>): the interconnectedness of FIs is a source of credit risk on interbank markets, that can cause the problem of contagious defaults. While earlier contributions (<a href=\"#bib5\">Allen and Gale, 2000</a>) stressed the benefits of increasing diversification, suggesting that the more connections there are the better for financial stability, later works have challenged this view, showing that diversification is not always beneficial for stability, and underlining instead the systemic risk provided by default cascades and other contagion effects. For instance, <a href=\"#bib12\">Battiston et al. (2012a)</a> show that, if a financial accelerator mechanism is present, then a potential trade-off between individual risk and systemic risk may exist due to the increasing connectivity of the network.<a href=\"#fn4\"><sup>4</sup></a> Similar results are provided by <a href=\"#bib34\">Gai and Kapadia (2010)</a>, who show that financial systems exhibit a robust-yet-fragile tendency: while the probability of contagion may be low, once a default cascade is started its spread can be quite large. In other words, credit network plays two different roles at the same time: on the one hand, it is useful for its risk-sharing effect, while on the other hand, it may be dangerous for its contagion effect. The problems arising from financial market interconnectedness have also been highlighted by studies such as <a href=\"#bib25\">Cocco et al. (2009)</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">Gai et al. (2011)</a> and <a href=\"#bib32\">Di Iasio et al. (2015)</a>.",

                            "text": "In the last few years, many papers have extended the analysis from a simple single layer network to <b>multi-layer networks</b> (see <a href=\"#bib8\">Bargigli et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Molina-Borboa et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Poledna et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Montagna and Kok, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Aldasoro and Alves, 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Huser and Kok, 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Huser and Kok, 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Covi et al., 2021</a>). Multi-layer networks feature a layer for each kind of asset, disaggregating them into groups with different seniority or maturity. <a href=\"#bib41\">H\u00fcser et al. (2018)</a> find that \u201cthe network layers have very different link structures and there is strong heterogeneity in the significance of banks in the different layers\u201d, therefore this disaggregation is of paramount importance. <a href=\"#bib47\">Molina-Borboa et al. (2015)</a> show that focusing on a single layer severely underestimates total systemic risk computed with the DebtRank measure developed in <a href=\"#bib13\">Battiston et al.

Therefore, one detailed large model is preferable to a number of small models, each describing a specific asset, kind of institution or risk of the financial activity. For instance, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) produced a staff report to review how markets behaved during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kothari, 2020</a>). The report finds interconnections in many ways among the various U.S. credit markets, which raises the concerns for the spillover of risks and shocks from one market to the others.",

Then, the modelling framework should be grounded in the empirical evidence, using real data as stressed by <a href=\"#bib55\">Ramadiah et al.

Many network studies (see the already cited literature reviews, such as <a href=\"#bib49\">Neveu, 2016</a>) simulate what happens to the financial system, for instance, if one bank defaults due to an exogenous shock: this event determines bad debts to other banks in the interbank markets, that can go bankrupt with a new round of losses and so on, possibly causing a bank default cascade.

For instance, as explained in <a href=\"#bib32\">Di Iasio et al. (2015)</a>, a bank that suffers high losses (but does not default) shortens its distance-to-default and reduces the market value of its stocks and bonds; then, other banks that own these financial instruments in the \u201ctrading book\u201d will be required to cut the mark-to-market value with further losses. Therefore, DebtRank expresses the fraction of the total economic value of the network - excluding bank i - posed at risk by some exogenous shock that hits bank i. This measure has two advantages compared to other algorithms, as highlighted by <a href=\"#bib13\">Battiston et al. (2012b)</a>: it is a possible early warning indicator because it delivers a clear response well before the peak of the crisis, and it has the precise meaning of economic loss, measured in dollars, caused by a shock.",

In practice, if bank A loses \u03b1% of its equity value, than bank B, that owns some stocks of A, suffers a loss on its capital equal to a multiple of \u03b1% of the value of the A equity owned, representative of its exposure towards bank A in equity, credit and other instruments. This is an over-simplifying assumption due to the lack of data, that probably overestimates the effect of the shock. A real assessment of the whole asset side of a bank should be carried out, and for each kind of exposure a different loss has to be associated with a loss on the bank equity. Indeed, for instance, the value of the bond of a bank could be reduced only by a small fraction, even if the stock market value of that bank decreases by a large percentage. Moreover, the relationship is highly nonlinear and, even in case of default, the value of a bond could not go to zero thanks to the recovery rate (RR), that instead is assumed equal to zero in <a href=\"#bib32\">Di Iasio et al.

Moreover, subsequently to the 2008 G-20 at Washington D.C., the EU approved the EMIR (Regulation 648/2012), the MiFIR (Regulation 600/2014) and the MiFID 2 to force a better disclosure and a centralized negotiation in regulated markets with a clearing house even for some over-the-counter derivatives. Nevertheless, to obtain the required global view, an acceleration in the unification of the accounting standards is being carried out thanks to the G-20 Data Gaps Initiative (DGI) led by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In particular, the second phase of the initiative (DGI-2) aims at implementing \u201cthe regular collection and dissemination of comparable, timely, integrated, high quality, and standardized statistics for policy use\u201d, with recommendations \u201cfocused on datasets that support: (i) monitoring of risk in the financial sector; and (ii) analysis of vulnerabilities, interconnections and spillovers, not least cross-border\u201d. The DGI third progress report states that: \u201cConsiderable progress was made by the participating economies (\u2026). Areas of progress include, among others, shadow banking monitoring, reporting of data on G-SIBs, and improved coverage, timeliness, and periodicity of sectoral accounts.\u201d (<a href=\"#bib43\">IMF Staff and FSB Secretariat, 2018</a>).",

Theoretically, the Probability of Default (PD) is the key driver of the price of different financial instruments. Below a given PD, the various instruments follow many determinants largely analysed in the vast literature on asset pricing, both common and specific of each asset class, while when the PD goes over a certain value, they co-move in a different way. From the theoretical point of view, this feature can be described, for instance, following the Merton (1974) model and the subsequent measures such as the distance-to-default. Econometrically, the team should analyze how to model the time series of the prices of the same issuer\u2019s instruments as a function of common factors, such as the cited PD. Then, they will determine a function that associates with an equity loss (with the consequent reduction of the distance-to-default or of the regulatory ratios), a loss for each of the other instruments examined. To tackle this job, they need market prices of various instruments issued by FIs that suffered large losses or went bankrupt. If the dataset is not large enough to have reliable estimates, some case studies could be analysed as a contingency plan. This job includes an evaluation of the RR for different kinds of instruments, in case of default or bail-in (however, for this task there are many empirical papers, estimates already performed by FIs, and regulatory guidelines). This feature is very important because the RR is a key driver of the systemic risk and typically gets worse exactly when the contagion is stronger (about the importance of the RR, <a href=\"#bib19\">Bruche and Gonz\u00e1lez-Aguado, 2010</a>, or <a href=\"#bib23\">Choi and Cook, 2012</a>). Therefore, the RR for each class of instruments has to be endogenously determined comparing the amount of losses with the amount of liabilities. In practice, this is simply an extension of the loss function to equity values below zero (for instance, if losses largely exceed the equity, the RR on unsecured debts should be low).",

Indeed, even if the classification is as detailed as possible, instruments with similar loss function can be classified in the same class. Moreover, some classes including assets for relatively low amounts can be aggregated in a miscellaneous \u201cother assets\u201d class. Some dimensions are particularly relevant for the loss function and, consequently, for the balance sheet partitioning: contractual typology, seniority, collateralization, maturity, and accounting rule, that is \u201cbanking book\u201d and \u201ctrading book\u201d. Indeed, there is the need to discern between \u201cbanking book\u201d and \u201ctrading book\u201d: the balance-sheet of a bank could be unaffected by a loss on an asset issued by another financial institution if the instrument is classified in the \u201cbanking book\u201d and the loss is not too high to trigger an \u201cimpairment test\u201d. This classification obviously follows the regulation. For instance, European banks follow the Ias/Ifrs accounting rules issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). In particular, the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) number 9 is very important because it determines how banks have to enter the value of the various assets in their balance sheets. It states that assets classified as \u201cHeld to Collect and Sell\u201d or \u201cOther trading\u201d have to be evaluated at the \u201cfair value\u201d; instead, assets classified as \u201cHeld to Collect\u201d have to be evaluated at the \u201cfair value\u201d if they do not pass the \u201cSPPI test\u201d (Solely Payments of Principal and Interest on the principal amount outstanding test),<a href=\"#fn8\"><sup>8</sup></a> while they have to be evaluated at the \u201camortized cost\u201d if they pass the \u201cSPPI test\u201d.

The same happens to the other banks that own instruments issued by bank A. Moreover, every bank hit by a loss has another impact on all the banks connected to it: the contagion is assessed with the simulation methodology developed in task 4. In case of bank default, this approach allows to determine the amount of the losses and, therefore, an endogenous RR for each instrument based on its seniority (for the Eurozone, also following the regulatory bail-in framework established by the \u201cSingle Resolution Mechanism\u201d) and collateralization.

Two relevant recent models of fire sales are <a href=\"#bib37\">Greenwood et al. (2015)</a> and Duarte and Eisenbach (2013, revised in 2018). These two models are based on the assumption of a leverage target, which leads to a linear deleveraging rule in reaction to a loss. This is an unreliable assumption in stress scenarios. Indeed, as explained by <a href=\"#bib26\">Cont and Schaanning (2017)</a>, \u201cthere is some empirical evidence that in the medium term large FIs maintain fairly stable levels of leverage - <a href=\"#bib3\">Adrian and Shin (2010)</a> - but it is not clear why the same institutions would enforce such leverage targets in the short term, especially in stress scenarios where this could entail high liquidation costs\u201d. They explain that deleveraging is the result of investor redemptions for funds, \u201cbut for regulated FIs such as banks, large scale deleveraging is mainly driven by portfolio constraints - capital, leverage or liquidity constraints - which may be breached when large losses occur\u201d. Therefore, they develop a quantitative framework to model fire sales in a network of FIs with common asset holdings, subject to regulatory constraints (for simplicity, they focus only on leverage constraint). The paper <a href=\"#bib26\">Cont and Schaanning (2017)</a> is a good starting point for this task.",

In this way, they also consider the possibility of a default due to a liquidity problem; indeed, an institution could be solvent thanks to the presence of a large amount of illiquid assets, but could go bankrupt because of the illiquidity problem. This is very relevant because they \u201cobserve that, while insolvency is the dominant mode of failure of banks in scenarios associated with extremely large initial shocks, illiquidity is the dominant mode of failure in scenarios associated with moderate shocks which are nevertheless large enough to trigger fire sales\u201d.",

This partitioning is, therefore, strictly related to the second job of this task, that is the estimation of a price reaction function. The team should econometrically study the time series of various market instruments with different degrees of liquidity, focusing especially on the recent worst market crashes. Therefore, there is the need to use market data (both prices and volumes). If the available datasets will not be large enough to generate reliable estimates, as a contingency plan, some event studies may be analysed. These analyses could also be performed starting from the vast market microstructure literature of pricing formation (for a recent literature review see, for instance, <a href=\"#bib10\">Barucci and Fontana, 2017</a>, Chapter 10). This is probably the most difficult job of the whole methodology, because many features have to be considered. Firstly, the price change should be a function of the sales of the analysed asset, but also of the overall sales in the market, given that almost all price movements have an idiosyncratic component, but also a systematic component related to the whole market. The presence of the market component is very relevant and it is always neglected: in case of a market crash, all FIs could suffer losses on their \u201ctrading book\u201d, even if they do not hold the assets that are fire sold. These widespread losses have to be accounted for. Secondly, the sequence of events is not simple: the amount needed to be fire sold can derive from the loss of the financial institution, but the loss derives from the fire sales and, moreover, the fire sold amount can be computed sequentially for each institution hit in the contagion, but it should consider the fact that the contagion could be simultaneous and feature reverberations among nodes. Thirdly, as explained by <a href=\"#bib26\">Cont and Schaanning (2017)</a>, the \u201cimplementation shortfall\u201d has to be considered: assets are liquidated at price lowering during the fire sale process, with the first assets sold at the pre-fire sales prices and last assets sold at the post-fire sales prices. Therefore, the average selling price should stay in the middle between pre- and post-fire sales prices.",

This is a very hot topic for regulators, because they can implement several different strategies.
