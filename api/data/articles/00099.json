Unobserved heterogeneity is often considered in estimation, but not in forecasting, beyond trivial cases. Non-trivial cases involve individuals that enter the simulation with a history of previous outcomes. We show that the simple solutions of attributing to these individuals a null effect or a random draw from the estimated unconditional distributions lead to biased forecasts, which are often worse than those obtained neglecting unobserved heterogeneity altogether. We then present a first implementation of the Rank method, a new algorithm for assigning individual effects to the simulation sample. Out-of-sample validation of our model shows that use of the Rank method significantly improves the quality of the forecasts.",

The choice of the econometric specification is therefore crucial for the quality of the predictions. This is particularly true when unobserved heterogeneity (UH) is an issue, given that microsimulations have been explicitly developed to allow distributional analysis and hence a thorough consideration of individual idiosyncrasies. However, netting out the estimated coefficients from the effects of individual-specific components does not guarantee better quality forecasts, as long as these individual-specific components are not appropriately simulated. This is an easy task if the simulation sample is the same as the estimation sample (statistical packages generally provide an estimation of the individual effect for each estimation unit), or if \u201cnew\u201d simulated individuals enter the simulation without a history of previous outcomes (the individual effects can be randomly assigned by drawing from their estimated unconditional distributions). If this is not the case, individual effects should be drawn from conditional (posterior) distributions, given the observed outcomes and the value of the covariates.",

This means that some individuals have a higher probability of participation thanks to unobservable characteristics, say motivation, attitude, etc. We get estimates for the coefficients, and an estimate for the standard deviation of the random effects, which are assumed to be normally distributed and independent of the observables. We want to apply these estimates to a different population, which is observed in the base year. This means \u2013let us be redundant at this point\u2013 that in the base year we observe the observables, and we do not observe the unobservable characteristics of our population. Shall we simply ignore the unobservables, or shall we impute a random effect to each individual in the simulation sample? Take two individuals with the same observable characteristics: individual A is active, while individual B is inactive. Clearly, it is more likely that A has more favourable unobservable traits than B. If we ignore UH, the simulated labour market trajectories of A and B will be a priori similar, and heterogeneity is lost. If we sample from the estimated (unconditional) normal distribution of the individual effects, there is an equal probability that A gets a less favourable individual effect than B, or B gets a less favourable individual effect than A, which is also incorrect. The individual effect for A must be sampled from a different distribution than the one used for B.",

A different strategy has therefore emerged, which consists in drawing all individual effects from their unconditional distributions, and then assigning each random draw to a simulated individual with the aim to minimize an overall distance between realized and simulated outcomes (<a href=\"#bib52\">Panis, 2003</a>). This optimal assignment approach however runs into two problems: first, it introduces, in nonlinear models, a correlation between the individual effects and the covariates. Second, it is also computationally burdensome: the available optimal assignment algorithms developed in the operations research literature work in polynomial time (Carpaneto <i>et al.</i>, <a href=\"#bib17\">1988</a>; Burkard <i>et al.</i>, 2008). <a href=\"#bib56\">Richiardi (2014)</a> develops an algorithm that provides an optimal solution to the assignment problem in linear regression models, and an approximation of the optimal solution in nonlinear (binary response) models.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> This approximation has two interesting features: it greatly reduces the induced correlation problem of the optimal assignment solution in binary response models, and it is much faster, working in quasi-linear (<i>N log N</i>) time.",

Specifically, we compare the outcomes in terms of participation rates of different subgroups of the population in four versions of a microsimulation model: a benchmark in which all processes are modelled by means of simple pooled probit specifications with lagged endogenous variables and no UH, and three alternatives in which we specify random effect dynamic probit models, where initial conditions are estimated following Heckman (<a href=\"#bib36\">1981a</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">1981b</a>). These three variations differ in how individual UH is imputed in the simulated population: in the first one we assign an individual effect equal to zero (a \u201cnull\u201d effect) to all individuals, in the second one we assign each individual a random draw from the estimated unconditional distribution of UH, while in the third one we use the Rank method to assign each individual a random draw that matches his or her observed past history. We show that the differences in projected outcomes are large and significant. We base our estimations on the complete series of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP), which runs from 1994 to 2001, in order to be able to perform out-of-sample validation in the subsequent years. We find evidence that the forecasts obtained with imputation of UH through the Rank method remain sensibly more on track with historical data. Our microsimulation is applied to Italian data: for the purpose of our work, this is a particularly apt case study, as female participation rates are still very low as compared to other EU countries, despite having markedly increased over the past decades (Del Boca <i>et al.</i>, <a href=\"#bib26\">2006</a>).

For example, an individual might participate to the labour market despite unfavourable observable characteristics, due to favourable unobservable characteristics like a special taste for work, work ethics, need for money etc. These characteristics are likely to be at least to some extent persistent over time; therefore, they increase the likelihood that the individual will also participate in the future. These unobserved individual effects work in every respect as omitted variables. As <a href=\"#bib64\">Wooldridge (2005a</a>, p. 27) puts it, \u201c[i]n nonlinear models, much has been made about the deleterious effects that ignoring heterogeneity can have on the estimation of parameters, even when the heterogeneity is assumed to be independent of the observed covariates. A leading case is the probit model with an omitted variable. <a href=\"#bib66\">Yatchew and Griliches (1985)</a> show that when the omitted variable is independent of the explanatory variables and normally distributed, the probit estimators suffer from (asymptotic) attenuation bias. This result is sometimes cited to illustrate how a misspecification that is innocuous in linear models leads to problems in nonlinear models\u201d.<sup><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup> Moreover, the individual effect is not independent of the lagged dependent variable, if included among the covariates, as the latter is correlated by construction with the lagged residual, which includes the unobserved permanent individual effect. As a result, estimates of state dependence that fail to account for permanent UH are in general upward biased: the model attributes to true state dependence any individual effect that makes a transition to a different state less likely.<sup><a href=\"#fn6\">6</a></sup>",

This is less of an issue in static microsimulations, as the simulation sample generally coincides with the estimation sample, where individual effects can be estimated. On the other hand, dynamic microsimulations generally include many processes (like schooling, household formation, labour market transitions, retirement, etc.): it is quite unlikely that a single dataset exists with all the relevant variables so that it can be used both for estimation of all processes and as a basis for simulation; this being all the more so as models with UH require panel data for estimation. A more common situation is to estimate different processes on different datasets, and then apply the estimated coefficients to some initial population to be simulated forward in time. Moreover, the initial population generally needs to be expanded as the simulation proceeds, possibly including offspring, spouses and immigrants. If the simulated individuals enter the simulation without a history of previous outcomes, the solution is straightforward: sampling random individual effects from the estimated (unconditional) distribution. However, to the extent to which not every individual is simulated from birth (a very unlikely scenario even in cohort models), the simulated individuals in the initial population enter the simulation with a history of previous outcomes. This is also the case whenever the simulated population expands over time with the inclusion of spouses and immigrants. Even newborns can enter the simulation with some pre-set variables. For instance, the ECHP / EU-SILC surveys only record information for individuals aged 16+: if such data are used for estimation of the processes included in the microsimulation (which is common, at least for EU models, given their wide coverage), the simplest solution is to let newborns enter the simulation when they are already grown up, with many education and labour market related events having already been occurred.",

Second, we can draw the individual effects from the estimated distributions of the random intercepts, conditional on the observed past outcomes and the covariates. This is trivial in linear models with Gaussian random effects, less straightforward and more computationally complex in linear models with fixed effects, where the fixed effects follow an arbitrary (non-Gaussian) distribution, and in binary response models with random effects.

Methods for solving this optimal assignment problem can be borrowed from the linear programming literature. However, they work in (third or fourth order) polynomial time. This might be an impediment in forecasting exercises that involve hundreds of thousands or even millions of individuals, as is common in dynamic microsimulation models (Li and O\u2019Donoghue, 2013). A further problem of the optimal assignment approach is that, in nonlinear models, it introduces a correlation between the individual effects and the covariates (<a href=\"#bib56\">Richiardi, 2014</a>).",

Even works focusing on the treatment of UH as <a href=\"#bib30\">Galler (1995)</a> fail to recognize the issue.<sup><a href=\"#fn9\">9</a></sup> We have not been able to find a single dynamic microsimulation model where the problem of the imputation of the individual effects is considered. In the absence of specific information, it is reasonable to assume that new individuals are simply given the average individual effect (which is normalized to 0) or, at best, a random draw from the unconditional distributions. However, estimating a random intercept discrete choice model (either fixed or random effects) and imputing a null effect to the population to be projected forward in time leads to possibly big biases in forecasting. This is due to the nonlinearity of the latent variable model. To see why, suppose two individuals have the same observables, but they differ because of UH: for the sake of illustration, suppose they have two symmetric individual effects around a mean value of 0. The outcome variable is binary. The average probability of the event of the two heterogeneous individuals is different from the probability of the average individual, with the size of the bias depending on the standard deviation of the individual effect and the direction of the bias depending on the local concavity of the probit or logit transformation: imputing a null individual effect leads to overestimate the frequency of occurrence of an event if the average probability is higher than .5, and to underestimate it if it is lower. Moreover, a break is introduced at an individual level between the past (for which outcomes depend on the true individual effect) and the future (for which outcomes depend only on observables), thus making simulated life trajectories less likely. This can have important consequences, for instance with respect to eligibility to social benefits, seniority accrual, etc. Whilst the first problem (the forecasting bias) is solved by attributing each simulated individual a random draw from the unconditional distribution of individual effects, the latter problem (the break in individual trajectories) turns out to be even aggravated.<sup><a href=\"#fn10\">10</a></sup>",

Moreover, even when this is the case alignment only corrects for biases in the average values, while an improper treatment of UH also impinges, as we have seen, on the veracity of individual trajectories.",

To see why, consider switching the imputed random intercepts for individuals <i>8</i> and <i>10</i>: while individual <i>8,</i> who is observed as a success, remains predicted as a failure, individual <i>10</i> (who is also a success) is now assigned a value of UH high enough, and turns concordant. Said differently, assigning a positive but small value of the random intercept to <i>8</i> is a waste, as it does not make the score of <i>8</i> positive. However, with respect to the optimal assignment solution, the method has two advantages, as we have already anticipated: it greatly reduces computing time (from polynomial to quasi-linear), and it greatly reduces the induced correlation problem, in particular when heterogeneity in the covariates increases. The reason why this happens is that as heterogeneity in the observable characteristics increases, the likelihood that UH is decisive in determining the outcome decreases (see <a href=\"#equ1\">eq. 1</a>), and random assignment due to tie-breaking becomes more frequent. However, the Rank method still significantly outperforms a pure random assignment according to the unconditional distribution of the individual effects (the mean squared forecasting error is approximately halved, irrespective of the value of the covariates).",

The medium participation group includes countries where the participation rate was in the 50\u201360% range. Finally, the low participation group includes Italy, Spain and Greece, where the female participation rate was lower than 50%. The latter group was also the target of the Lisbon 2000 Agenda, which set a goal of (at least) 60% for the female employment rate, to be achieved by 2010.

This paper follows the random effects approach in order to have a fully specified model in which one can estimate all the quantities of interest, including the coefficients of time invariant characteristics (e.g. gender). This allows not only to interpret the coefficients correctly \u2013as in standard microeconometric papers\u2013burden of different but, of most importance here, to simulate forward the evolution of the initial population. The random effects approach usually lead to more efficient estimators of the parameters of the model if the distributional assumptions are satisfied. Moreover, traditional maximum likelihood estimator of non-linear panel data models with fixed effects generally exhibits considerable bias in finite sample when the number of periods is not large.<sup><a href=\"#fn14\">14</a></sup>",

We first estimate standard probit models. To account for UH and solve the initial conditions problem, we then estimate dynamic random effects models. The estimated coefficients and standard errors are shown in <a href=\"#table5\">Table 5</a>. To compare the probit coefficients with those from the random effects estimators, the latter need to be multiplied by an estimate of 1/\u221a(1+\u03c3<sub>\u03b1</sub><sup>2</sup>), where \u03c3<sub>\u03b1</sub> represents the size of UH (see <a href=\"#bib10\">Arulampalam, 1999</a>). Allowing for the different normalizations, the scaled estimate for lagged participation (unemployment) is 0.54 (0.70), significantly less than the pooled probit estimate. Participation (unemployment) yesterday increases the probability of participating (being unemployed) today. The relationship between male participation and age follows the usual inverse U-shape. Higher education increases male participation and decreases the probability of being unemployed. Living in the south of Italy decreases male participation and increases the probability of being unemployed.",

Therefore, both participation and living in consensual union at time <i>t</i> are modelled as a function of lagged participation, lagged consensual union status, the existence of children under three (at time <i>t-1),</i> age, year of birth, level of education, area of residence and being a student (at time <i>t-1).</i> Moreover, model estimation is conditioned on not being retired or a student at time <i>t.</i> Dummies for the area of residence also capture regional differences in the availability of childcare and other (local) institutional factors. In order to simplify the model and keep a dichotomous participation outcome variable we do not explicitly model work hours. This implies that we do not consider the availability of part-time. Since the share of female part-time employment in the total employment has increased almost linearly since 1990, from about 10% to about 30% with few regional differences, this increase is captured by the cohort effect.<sup><a href=\"#fn20\">20</a></sup>",

Then, column 3 and 4 report the coefficients and standard errors of the dynamic probit model with random effects. As explained above, the random effects probit and pooled probit models involve different normalizations. The scaled estimate of the coefficient on lagged participation (living in consensual union) is 0.90 (2.25), significantly less than the pooled probit estimate: this indicates that omitting permanent UH leads to overestimation of state dependence. There is a lot of heterogeneity that cannot be accounted for by the explanatory variables: the estimated \u03c3<b>\u03b1</b> is equal to 1.2 (0.89). Instead, the estimated coefficients on the other covariate are similar (sometime larger) than the pooled estimates.",

Accordingly, an important aspect of dynamic microsimulation modelling is the validation of results produced by the simulation exercise. However, the applied literature has devoted little attention to validation procedures and the quantification of uncertainty around model predictions (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wolf, 2001</a>), and there is currently no apparent consensus among practitioners on what constitutes a best practice. In this section, we focus on a specific aspect of validation: ex-post validation of model outcome. With the limitations arising from the fact that the ECHP was discontinued in 2001 and replaced only in 2004 by a different survey (EU-SILC), and the fact that the most recent years cannot be used for validation due to the impact of the Great Recession, we compare the simulated female participation rates with the actual participation trends computed on the Italian EU-SILC data over the period 2005\u20132008.<sup><a href=\"#fn22\">22</a></sup> The four versions of the model that we test are labelled <i>Probit</i> (pooled probit estimates), <i>Null</i> (dynamic random effect probit estimates without imputation of random effects), <i>Unconditional</i> (dynamic random effect probit estimates with imputation of random effects from the unconditional distributions), <i>Rank</i> (dynamic random effect probit estimates with imputation of random effects by means of the Rank method).",

Depending on the estimation method we get significant differences in both males and females participation rates. For females, these differences become larger over time: at the end of the simulation period, the difference between predictions obtained under the Rank and the Null scenario amounts to almost 10 percentage points. This corresponds almost exactly to the bias we expect due to nonlinearity of the probit transformation, for the estimated standard deviation of the individual effects: +4% (+8%) for the Null scenario at the beginning (end) of the simulation period, when the average activity rate under the Rank scenario is .57 (.65). Also expected, given the theoretical results (<a href=\"#bib56\">Richiardi, 2014</a>), is the similarity between the Rank and the Unconditional scenario, when cross-sectional figures are considered.",

The second column is computed using the true data as base year (2001) and the first period of the simulated data as final year (2002): it thus encompass any discontinuity in life trajectories due to the imputation method. Theory suggests that state persistence (the coefficients of the lagged endogenous variables) should be lower for the Unconditional scenario, intermediate for the Null scenario and higher (though still below the target) for the Rank scenario. The third column reports the averages of the coefficients of the lagged endogenous variables computed over the couples of years 2002\u20132003 to 2007\u20132008, estimated on simulated data. Theory now suggests that state persistence should pick up again, with the coefficients under the Rank and the Unconditional scenario broadly similar and higher than those under the Null scenario. This is broadly in line with what we find. State persistence decreases in the first year of the simulation for the Unconditional scenario, as the true individual effects governing past outcomes are replaced by random draws from the unconditional distributions, which are by definition uncorrelated with the true individual effects. From the second year of the simulation onward state persistence picks up again, and individual trajectories keep the memory of the artificial discontinuity of the previous year. Under the Null scenario, on the other hand, state persistence decreases less that under the Unconditional scenario on the first year, but then remains stationary at this level. Only under the Rank scenario state persistence remains reasonably close to the true value, keeping the discontinuity of lifetime trajectories in the first period of the simulation at a minimum.",

The only theoretically sound methodology in this case is sampling from the estimated conditional distributions, which can be fairly complicated in nonlinear models. Using a dynamic microsimulation model of labour supply in Italy as a testbed, we have shown that neglecting the problem (i.e. assigning a null effect to all individuals) implies a forecasting bias in discrete choice models, due to nonlinearity of the probit/logit transformations. Sampling from the unconditional estimated distributions of the individual effects prevent the forecasting bias, hence getting cross-sectional statistics right, but introduces unnatural breaks in individual trajectories at the moment of imputation, therefore getting longitudinal statistics wrong. The same applies if the estimates are obtained under simple specifications without unobserved heterogeneity. We have then provided a first empirical application of a new algorithm that greatly reduces the complexity of sampling from the conditional distributions, at the cost of introducing a small correlation between the imputed individual effects and the individual observable characteristics. Our results have been validated on out-of sample data, albeit admittedly short. Imputing individual effects with the new method allows to remain more on track with observed data both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.",
