The ultimate goal must, however, be to make an inference to the economy, whether on a macro or a micro level. To do this adequate micro data are needed as well as a basis for the inference.",

To illustrate by a simple example, if we only know the sum of two variables each of which are linearly related to two other variables, it is not possible to identify the two intercepts. In a more complex model, it might be difficult to see if the model is identified or not. If not, the search for a maximum (minimum) may go on forever.
