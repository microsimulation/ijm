The argument is that farm incomes are going to vary spatially as a result of different aspects of natural capital (e.g., soil condition, forage areas, temperature, rainfall, etc). They then use an income generation model that includes natural capital, alongside physical capital and human capital, to augment the geospatial microsimulation model. The results do show that natural capital has an impact on incomes, and in the direction expected: areas with lower levels of natural capital have reduced incomes compared to the model without a natural capital adjustment.",

The article is highly commendable as it is one of the rare descriptions of models developed by Government departments. This helps reducing the opacity of models with high potential due to their access to administrative data, but which remain proprietary and not shared with the public.",

This goes beyond more standard analyses that look at the migrant population only at a national level. More specifically, the paper analyses the evolution of the gender and migrant wage gaps over a 20-year horizon in 402 German districts. The authors find that one of the main drivers in income inequality for both women and migrants is heterogeneity in working hours, but they also find persistent differences in the evolution of the income gaps between East and West Germany, and between urban and rural areas. They conclude that the ability to simulate spatially differentiated outcomes is important for designing appropriate policies to address income inequality.",

Of more than 40 articles returned after searching for \u2018microsimulation\u2019, published in academic journals thus far in 2024, the vast majority is either in health, or traffic and transportation (17 and 19 hits respectively). Energy, labour and demography have only one hit each, and two articles referred to tax-benefit modelling. While the IJM intercepts a small but important subset of health microsimulation, we barely have any presence in traffic and transportation. This reflects a deliberate choice of the journal to focus on social sciences rather than engineering. However, integrated spatial models where interactions between agents \u2013 from labour supply and demand to contagion and epidemics dynamics \u2013 happen based on multi-layered networks of relations between agents and physical places, including transport networks, represent one of the frontiers in microsimulation modelling. Multi-layered networks have received some attention in the context of analyses of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, but have yet to find their way into standard modelling practice. <a href=\"#bib1\">Bookstaber (2017)</a> book <i>The end of Theory</i> offers an insightful analysis of how the multi-layered network structure of financial institutions paved the way to the financial collapse of 2008-2009. The book also offers a compelling view of the complexity approach to Economics, and argues in favour of agent-based modelling as <i>the</i> methodology of choice for economic modelling. I will return to the relationship between agent-based modelling and microsimulation in future Editorials.",
