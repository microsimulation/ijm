                "text": "In high immigration countries, linguistic integration to the host society may constitute an important economic, social and political issue. This is likely to be even more salient in countries where two or more languages are already competing. Canada is an officially bilingual country characterized by a low fertility and a high immigration regime. This paper describes a dynamic microsimulation model projecting the population of Canada and its regions by mother tongue and language used at home. Emphasis is put on the language module of the model which allows for changes in language characteristics, namely intergenerational changes in mother tongue and intragenerational changes in home language. Mother tongue and home language are then projected for different scenarios in order to investigate the impact of changes in levels and linguistic composition of immigration. Different hypothesis with regard to language preferences of immigrants (which may be influenced through language management legislation) are also taken into account. Results are presented for two regions, the province of Quebec and the rest of Canada at the horizon 2051 as well as for the stable population. Projection results show that the population of non-official mother tongues will increase rapidly to reach 31% in 2051. More interestingly, the results show that the increase in home language is less important due to language shifts. Since these are more favourable to English than French, the ratio of English speakers to French speakers is increasing both in Qu\u00e9bec and in the rest of Canada, thus shifting the equilibrium between official languages",

For immigrants, the knowledge and use of the dominant language is often a fundamental prerequisite to economic and cultural integration to the host society. In the absence of a constant influx of immigration, immigrants\u2019 own languages are relatively short-lived. Studies have shown that grand- children of original immigrants seldom use the language of their grand-parents, most notably as their main language spoken at home (<a href=\"#bib3\">B\u00e9langer, Lachapelle, &amp; Sabourin, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Rumbaut, Massey, &amp; Bean, 2006</a>).",

Canada constitutes an important exception to this rule, as several demolinguistic projection models have been developed over the years, thanks to the availability of abundant language data in census and surveys alike. Canada\u2019s interest in language issues has deep roots in its demography and its peculiar history: its official languages \u2013 English and French \u2013 were put at the core of its constitution, its political symbolism and its mythology<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup>.

The high influx of immigration continuously modifies the country\u2019s demographic and linguistic landscape, impacting on the relative size of official language populations as most immigrants to Canada typically integrate to the English community. In the past, the high fertility of the French Canadians prevented a rapid decline of their percentage of the total population that would have been induced by the higher proportion of English speakers among immigrants. Nowadays, however, fertility is low among both English and French Canadians, and about two thirds of the Canadian population growth is due to an increasingly diverse immigration. Between 2001 and 2006, Canada's foreign-born population increased by 14% \u2013 four times faster than the growth rate of the Canadian-born population during the same period \u2013 and most immigrants have a mother tongue that is neither English nor French. Consequently the share of the Allophone population \u2013 those having a non-official language as a mother tongue \u2013 is growing rapidly: from 18% in 2001 to 20% in 2006.

Hence, individuals having a Latin mother tongue, or a mother tongue that is spoken in former French colonies, will be called <b>Francotropes</b> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Castonguay, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chiswick &amp; Miller, 1994</a>). Conversely, individuals having a Germanic mother tongue, or a mother tongue that is spoken in former British colonies, will be called <b>Anglotropes</b>. Some Allophones, such as Chinese for example, may be neither Francotrope nor Anglotrope and are thus randomly assigned to one of the two categories. Note that this subcategorization is contextual and is a reflection of a reality that only prevails in Qu\u00e9bec: all immigrants outside Qu\u00e9bec tend to adopt English, regardless of their mother tongue or their country of origin.",

As such, a person may declare having two mother tongues or speaking most often at home more than one languages. Such multiple declarations were simplified by randomly retaining one of the indicated languages and dropping the other(s). Multiple declarations amount to 1.3% of the population for mother tongue (5% if only considering Allophones) and 1.8% for language most often spoken at home (12% if only considering speakers of non-official languages). There exist various methods of treating multiple declarations, all of which slightly affect language shift rates and orientation. The method used here was shown to be a robust and acceptable analytic middle ground (<a href=\"#bib29\">Sabourin &amp; B\u00e9langer, Forthcoming</a>).",

In Canada as a whole, the proportion of Allophones increases from 20% in 2006 to 31% in 2051. In terms of percentage points, the increase is similar in Qu\u00e9bec (from 12% to 24%) and in the rest of Canada (from 23% to 33%). The relative increase is, however, much steeper in Qu\u00e9bec, as the percentage of Allophones doubles in the course of the simulation. Historically, immigration has been much lower in Qu\u00e9bec than in the rest of Canada, but rates have been converging in the last decade, thus explaining the rapid increase of the Allophone population observed in Qu\u00e9bec. As a correlate to the growth of the Allophone population, a significant decrease in the relative importance of both official languages is also observed. Perhaps more interestingly, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> also shows that the proportion of Allophones speaking an official language at home also increases significantly, even a little faster than the Allophone population still speaking their mother tongue at home. This is due to the fact that second-generation immigrants, more likely to perform a language shift than first- generation immigrants, will comprise a growing portion of the Canadian population. Close to 90% of second-generation immigrants have performed a language shift by the age of 50. So if immigration does bring large changes in the mother tongue composition of the population, changes in the composition according to language spoken at home are not as large due to the dampening effect of language shifts. Moreover, some immigrants have performed a language shift even before or at their arrival in Canada, so the proportion of speakers of non-official languages in new immigration is lower than the proportion of Allophones. Indeed, census data shows that about 15 to 25% of immigrants having resided for less than six months in Canada declare a language most often spoken at home that is different from their mother tongue.",

Also, the relative proportion of Anglophones with respect to Francophones is increasing in both regions: in Canada as a whole there were 2.6 Anglophones per Francophone in 2006 compared to 3.2 in 2051.

In this model, since several dimensions are at play (fertility, internal migration, immigration and emigration, language shifts and duration of residence in Canada for immigrants), a 400 year projection period was necessary to reach stable state. Of course, projections over such a long term cannot, and should not, be taken as anything near prediction of the future.

Conversely, the decline of French in Qu\u00e9bec and English in the rest of Canada in 2051 is linked to the intensity of immigration: a more intense immigration leads to a larger decrease in the majority language population. Immigration intensity only marginally affects minority language speakers: English in Qu\u00e9bec benefits from a small increase in both immigration scenarios whereas French in the rest of Canada declines in both scenarios. Interestingly, immigration intensity does not have an impact in the long run, as language composition in the stable population is the same for both high and low intensity scenarios, as well as for the base scenario. Moreover, in Canada outside Qu\u00e9bec, the English population is relatively larger in the stable population than it is in 2051, and inversely for the third language population. This happens because as time passes and population increases, new immigration represents a lower and lower percentage of the total population. Additionally, second-generation immigrants, a group more prone to language shift than first- generation immigrants, grow in relative importance. In light of these results, it appears that Canada outside Qu\u00e9bec had already reached the point of equilibrium of its linguistic composition in 2006 (under the assumptions of the projection, of course), and that the projected increase in the third language population over the 2006\u20132051 period is a transient phenomenon. The story is different in Qu\u00e9bec where the third-language population was lower in 2006 than in the rest of Canada, and where language shifts benefit both French and English: stable population results show that in Qu\u00e9bec, French continues to decrease and English continues to increase after 2051.",

The results were presented for Qu\u00e9bec, the only province with a French-speaking majority, and the rest of Canada, in which English speakers form the majority. The projection scenarios used in this paper emphasized the effect of immigration level, linguistic composition of immigration and language shifts, all factors that can be influenced by changes in immigration selection or linguistic integration policies.",

Second, in Canada outside Qu\u00e9bec, under the assumption of constant immigration, the proportion of third language speakers is lower in the stable population than it is at the 2051 horizon. This shows that as population increases, language shift overcompensates for increases due to immigration.

In Ontario, where the second largest population of French speakers is located, the dispersion and decrease of the minority population prompted the government to close the only French hospital in the province. The hospital was finally kept open after the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the French communities, but this settlement came at the end of a judiciary fight that lasted for four years.",

Our scenarios demonstrate that the linguistic composition of future immigration and language preferences of immigrants, not immigration intensity, are the most important long-term factors reducing or increasing the rate of decline of French in Qu\u00e9bec. This is placing Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s policy makers in a difficult situation. As <a href=\"#bib11\">Chiswick and Miller (1994)</a> noted, a fully French speaking immigration might not be desirable, or even possible, given the limited number of potential international immigrants having French as a mother tongue and still speaking French at home. Limiting the immigration to French speakers might have a negative impact on the economic integration of newcomers and possibly also on productivity, especially if in doing so Qu\u00e9bec has to change the composition of its immigration relative to factors that are positively related to economic integration, such as the level of education. On the other hand, the changing linguistic makeup of the province may have significant political and social consequences as well (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sabourin &amp; Marois, 2014</a>).",

There is now increasing pressure on the government to reduce the importance of knowledge of French in the immigration selection grid in order to attract skilled labour proficient in English only. It will be interesting to see how the evolving policy context impacts on the demolinguistic future of Qu\u00e9bec and Canada.",
