The paper by Peter Ericson and Lennart Flood identifies a Swedish tax/benefit design that maximizes social welfare. Their study deviates from the mainstream literature by using a micro simulation model with estimated behavioural responses. This way, heterogeneity in consumption-leisure preferences for different household types is taken into account.",

This invitation was fortunately successful. The note by Judith Flory and Sven St\u00f6whase discusses the static microsimulation model MIKMOD-ESt. Developed and operated on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Finance, it focuses on the German personal income tax. The model is based on official tax returns and thus allows for very detailed analyses and the evaluation of small and selective reforms.",
