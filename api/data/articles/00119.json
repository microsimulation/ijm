The articles cover a wide range of applications, from transport (Cao <i>et al.</i>) to health (Hennessy <i>et al.</i>), pensions (Tikanm\u00e4ki <i>et al.</i>) and taxes (Albarea <i>et al.</i>). The first two papers deal with methodological issues. The paper on subway carriage design by Cao and coauthors introduces state-of-the-art machine learning methods for model evaluation, while Hennessy and coauthors describe how to use data fusion techniques to match different datasets or impute missing data, with an application to health care in Canada; they provide a good discussion of the limitations of this empirical attempt. The last two papers deal with important policy issues. Tikanm\u00e4ki <i>et al</i>. evaluate the pension reform that will be implemented in Finland starting in 2017. They show that the reform will slightly increase the overall inequality among pensioners, as it will phase in only gradually; however, within each cohort it will reduce pension disparities. Finally, Albarea and coauthors introduce BETAMOD, a new static model for individual income taxation in Italy. The main peculiarities of this model are a detailed set of tax expenditures characterizing each taxpayer, and the estimation of individual-specific tax evasion rates. It would be interesting to see in a future issue of this journal a comparison between the many existing tax-benefit models for this country (see the reference list in their paper).",

                    "text": "Overall, this variety of applications is representative of the flexibility of the microsimulation approach, and stresses the multidisciplinary nature of the journal. Also, the big number of coauthors (almost six per article, on average) is a reminder of the importance of collaborative research for the development of microsimulation models. Unfortunately, the possibility to extend (implicit or explicit) cooperation beyond specific research groups is often limited by the lack of publicly available, well documented source code. In simulation, the code is the analogue to proofs for analytical models. While a good model description, possibly complemented by pseudo-code, should in principle allow replicability, a common experience is that replicability is hard, often very hard. Hence, most models are built from scratch, or on the basis of previous work by the same authors/research groups, generating at best <i>genealogies</i> of models with little crossbreed. This impedes the development of the field. As a counter-example, think of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models, which are also simulated. A large and increasing number of the best known models are easily available through the Macroeconomic Model Database (<a href=\"#bib12\">Wieland <i>et al</i>., 2012</a>): PhD students can download, modify and extend these models, contributing to the diffusion of the methodology.<a href=\"#fn1\"><sup>1</sup></a> I personally believe that the code of our microsimulation models should be made available from public, stable repositories, not only to referees but to the scientific community at large, and I invite authors to submit their code to the journal as an appendix to their manuscripts.",

These features are shared by a closely related methodology, agent-based modelling, whose three roots are the literature on complex adaptive systems, evolutionary economics, and \u2026. dynamic microsimulation itself, in particular the work of Barbara Bergmann (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bergmann, 1974</a>) and Gunnar Eliasson (<a href=\"#bib3\">Eliasson, 1977</a>). The main difference between dynamic microsimulation and agent-based modelling is the incorporation of more data into the first approach, and more interaction between agents and agent-types in the latter. Bergmann and Eliasson were the first to incorporate explicitly the interaction between the supply and demand for labour in a dynamic microsimulation model, a feature that is now becoming increasingly common in microsimulation (see <a href=\"#bib7\">Peichl and Siegloch, 2013</a>). At the same time, agent-based modelling are becoming more data-driven (<a href=\"#bib9\">Richiardi, 2013</a>). A convergence of the two approaches is hence under way, and this explains why I am keen to open the journal to contributions from the agent-based modelling community, as well as to other literatures that share a micro perspective, and a simulation approach.",
