Unlike earlier microsimulation-based applications of this approach, such as Gruber and Wise (<a href=\"#bib9\">1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2004</a>), this model does not take a representative sample as the point of departure, but simulates the costs and benefits of postponing retirement for four fictitious employees, representing male and female white- and blue-collar workers. While confirming conclusions drawn by other authors, this model allows for the separation of specific retirement schemes, and of the effect of different fiscal regimes for those retired and working. It is shown that differences between retirement schemes show up in differences in replacement rates and by whether or not the retirement benefit is a function of career length. Furthermore, advantageous fiscal regulations for the retired have a strong impact on the implicit costs of postponing retirement.",

It also concludes that an effective way to moderate costs would be to persuade individuals to postpone their retirement, as an increase by one year of the average age at which people retire would decrease the budgetary cost of ageing by 0.9% of GDP.

What is the penalty for continuing to work? And does this differ between workers of different categories, and between the two main public retirement schemes available in Belgium? These questions are to be answered exploiting the so-called option-value approach. The model to be presented in this paper is based on the notion of actuarial non-neutrality (<a href=\"#bib16\">OECD, 2003</a>: 4) of a retirement scheme, setting the gains from postponing retirement (extra salary) against the losses (foregone expected pension, for all future years until decease) associated with a specific retirement scheme.

This may not be the best variable to reflect a retirement decision, for two reasons. First, it is based on pension benefit in the first year after retirement, and ignores the future development of pension benefit conditional upon the year of retirement. Second, it suggests that working and retirement are two exchangeable strategies, i.e. that a retired individual can re-enter the labour market in any future year. Although this may be theoretically possible, in practise such behaviour is rare. Hence Duval (<a href=\"#bib7\">2003</a>: 34) describes retirement as an \u201cabsorbing rather than as a dynamic state\u201d.",

This means that information on specific alternative retirement schemes are combined for existing individuals, and that the information on different individuals is combined in the estimation results. In contrast, the Micro-Economic Pension model (MEP) to be presented in this paper may be classified as a standard model. As in a conventional microsimulation model, the point of departure is the individual; but a standard simulation model concentrates on the calculation of the various indicator variables for four fictional individuals representing male and female blue- and white-collar private-sector wage earners. It also includes two separate \u2018first-pillar\u2019 (state) retirement schemes \u2013 the early retirement scheme and a conventional early leavers\u2019 scheme. Instead of aggregating outcomes across these schemes and types of individual, MEP keeps them separate, so that comparisons can be made as to the actuarial non-neutrality of the two retirement schemes with respect to male or female white- or blue-collar workers, and the degree to which these schemes may stimulate a step into retirement. Furthermore, an explicit goal of MEP is to bring to the fore the effect of different tax regimes on the implicit costs of continuing to work. For this reason we follow the two OECD studies (<a href=\"#bib16\">OECD, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Duval, 2003</a>) in expressing the variables presented above in monetary units rather than in terms of utility. The advantage of this approach is that it prevents the simulation results being determined to some degree simply by assumptions concerning the difference in utility between a salary or a pension benefit of one euro. Moreover, it is in line with the widely used replacement ratio, which is also a ratio of currency-units. Finally, MEP does not include a behavioural equation relating the option value variables with effective retirement probabilities. So, a higher (lower) implicit cost of retiring is assumed to encourage (discourage) retirement, but it is unknown by how much exactly.",

Second, there is an additional benefit which equals 50% of the difference between the unemployment benefit and the last wage minus taxes and social-security benefits.

The first assumption pertains to the set of laws, rules and regulations on pensions, taxes and contributions that an individual faces in a certain year. In any year <i>r</i>, potential retirement benefits for all future years <i>s</i> are derived using information on laws, rules and regulations available at <i>r</i>. Suppose that an individual may choose to retire in 2003. His potential pension benefit in the future year 2010 will be derived using information available in 2003. If he or she postpones retirement and reconsiders in 2004, then the potential pension in the same year 2010 will be calculated using the information available in 2004. The second assumption pertains to the individuals who form the basis of the MEP model. To keep things simple, especially with respect to fiscal laws and regulations, it is assumed that an individual is either single or the sole income earner in the household. In other words, the income of the individual is the only income of their household. A consequence of this is that a married individual will by definition choose the family pension benefit of 75% of the wage-base.",

The year 2000 (at the age of 60) is the first year in which he can choose to retire. If he continues to work through this year, his gross income will be 47,811 euro. If he decides to apply for a pension benefit, this gross benefit will amount to 15,763 euro. The second row contains this information if he decides to work through 2000 and reconsider retirement in 2001 (i.e. at the age of 61). The ratio of alternative incomes, hereafter loosely called the replacement ratio, lies around 34%. That this is below 0.60, the fraction by which the pension base is multiplied to calculate the pension benefit, is caused by the fact that the pension benefit is based on the average (adjusted) wage over the length of the career, and given a maximum. Especially for male white-collar workers, the salary increases with age. The wage earned in the last year of the career is therefore higher than the average wage, and the \u2018replacement ratio\u2019 ends up well below 60%. The replacement ratio increasing with age is caused by the increasing career length, causing the pension benefit (the numerator) to increase, combined with the lower growth of the gross salary (the denominator). Finally, the net replacement ratio is 53% on average, and is higher than the gross replacement ratio. This is because of the progressiveness of the tax rate, and of a tax-exemption for retirees. This will be discussed further in <a href=\"#s6-3-1\">Section 6.3.1</a>.",

The future pension benefits for the remaining years of retirement may however increase as a result of the longer career. One moreover gains a years\u2019 salary. The gains outweigh the losses, so total wealth is maximized if one continues to work as long as possible, i.e. <i>max(Vr) = V2004</i>.

The <i>peak value</i> will therefore be negative and zero at the age of 64. When only pension benefits are considered, one should of course retire as soon as possible.",

So there is reason to retire as soon as the possibility arises. However, one does not only lose when postponing retirement; one gains salary as well. The variable <i>PR<sub>r</sub></i> shows the balance between the two alternatives. It again shows that the profit of postponing retirement decreases with age, especially between the first and second year. The last indicator <i>itax<sub>r</sub></i> shows the loss (the sum of lost future expected discounted pension benefits) as a fraction of the gain (salary). The advantage of this indicator is that it does not have a scale, and this will turn out to be convenient when the results are to be compared with those of other representative individuals. As <i>PR</i> is positive, <i>itax</i> will usually be positive as well, meaning that there is an implicit tax on working longer. In the first year, this implicit tax is almost 24%, but increases immediately to almost 33% in the second year. After that, the increase continues, albeit at a lower speed. The conclusion again is that retirement is encouraged, and that implicit taxes increase with age.",

There are two explanations for this. First, the increase of wage with age is higher for male white-collar workers than for female white-collar workers and blue-collar workers (see appendix). The average income will therefore be further below the last wage for the first category compared to the last two, and hence the difference in the replacement ratio. Second, as male white-collar workers have the highest income, the effect of the upper wage limit in the calculation of the wage-base (and therefore the pension) is more important, causing the replacement rate to be lower.",

The first, relating to the change of <i>itax</i> between male blue- and white-collar workers, is that the implicit tax rate increases with the replacement ratio (cf. <a href=\"#bib2\">B\u00f6rsch-Supan, 2000</a>: 131; <a href=\"#bib7\">Duval, 2003</a>: 33). The second, relating to the difference between male and female white-collar workers, is that the loss associated with postponing retirement is especially high for females. This is because the length of career required for a full pension benefit is shorter for women than for men, although increasing over time. As the year of entering the labour market is assumed to be the same for all typical individuals whose simulations are discussed, female employees reach a full pension before males. If full career is reached, postponing retirement no longer results in an increase in the pension benefit for the remaining retirement years. The profit associated with postponing retirement therefore decreases, and the implicit tax increases.",

                            "text": "The results for female blue-collar workers are discussed separately. With the employee-types discussed so far, the loss of one year of pension benefits as a result of postponing retirement outweighed the gain in the higher pension benefit in the remaining years. As a result <i>\u2206SSW</i> was negative, and <i>itax</i> was therefore positive as well. In the case of female blue-collar workers, this is no longer the case, as their pension benefit is not a function of the wage, but of the minimum pension benefit set by law. The effect of postponing retirement is therefore determined by the development of this minimum pension over time. If a female blue-collar worker postpones retirement from 2000 to 2001, the minimum pension benefit given a full career will have gone up considerably. Moreover, the woman does not have a full career and the effective minimum benefit level is decreased <i>pro rata temporis</i>. Postponing retirement therefore results in the effective minimum pension benefit increasing even further. This causes the profit of postponement to outweigh the loss, and thus results in an implicit subsidy (a negative implicit tax) on labour of 21%. In later years, the situation is back to normal in that <i>itax</i>&gt;0. This is because of the lower increase of the minimum pension benefit over time, combined with the fact that the woman has reached full career. The conclusion therefore is that it is profitable for blue-collar females to continue to work between 2000 and 2001, but highly costly afterwards.",

Moreover, the CELS benefit is subject to a higher wage ceiling than the pension benefit. The replacement ratio of the CELS benefit therefore exceeds that of the pension benefit. Consider an individual, say a male white-collar worker at the age of 60, who has the choice between a pension (the first line in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>) and a CELS benefit (the third line in <a href=\"#table5\">Table 5</a>). The gross income of course is the same in both cases, namely 47,811 euro, but the gross benefits are not: the pension benefit is 15,763 euro, whereas the CELS benefit amounts to 25,773 euro. But there is more; if one applies for the latter benefit, one does not retire but becomes unemployed. Pensionable career length will therefore continue to increase, and one will at 65 become eligible to a pension benefit of 18,856 euro. Clearly, when given the choice, one will always choose to enter the CELS over the retirement scheme. In practice, many older workers enter the CELS as a result of company restructuring. These people obviously do not have the choice between working and retiring. But even then does it remain advantageous to choose the CELS over the pension scheme.",

For the four categories of employees, the average net <i>itax</i> is 87% (0.784/0.422) higher for the former than for the latter. The first and most obvious reason for this is that the former benefit is higher than the latter, both before and after retirement. This is only part of the explanation though, for the average replacement ratio for the four workers is \u2018only\u2019 16% higher for the CELS benefit than the pension benefit. The second reason is that the CELS benefit is not affected by length of career. Postponing retirement, in contrast, only results in a loss of benefits, whilst the expected benefit to be received during the remaining future years does not change.",

For the other worker types considered, the salary earned when postponing retirement was larger than the pension benefit lost. However, the salary of female blue-collar workers is low. Moreover, due to the minimum unemployment benefit level and the fact that the additional benefit is a function of the difference between this benefit and net income, the total gross CELS benefit is relatively high, and the loss of postponing (in net amounts) outweighs the gain. The PR therefore is often negative or positive but very small, and the <i>option value</i> is zero in the first year. In stark contrast to the other types of employees, the female blue-collar worker actually loses wealth when she continues to work, and the average after-tax implicit tax on working longer is higher than 1.",

For pension benefits, these costs are generally higher for females than for males, and higher for blue-collar worker than for white-collar workers (with the exception of female blue-collar workers). For the CELS benefit, the results are more alike between the four categories, and the implicit taxes generally are higher. These results are based upon after-tax indicators of the cost of postponing retirement for single employees, who enter the labour market at the age of 20. How do these findings change when (i) before-tax indicators are calculated; (ii) the individual is no longer single, but has a partner without any income of their own; (iii) the individual has experienced a shorter career at the moment of becoming eligible to any benefit; (iv) changes are made to the rules for the calculation of the pension benefit, CELS benefit and the systems of social contributions and taxes. To facilitate discussion of these questions, <a href=\"#table9\">Tables 9 and 10</a> do not contain the year-to-year simulation results, but these results averaged over all decision years <i>r</i>. For example, the top-left quadrant of <a href=\"#table9\">Table 9</a> contains the averages of <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>. To further facilitate discussion, <a href=\"#table9\">Table 9</a> introduces the variable <i>x\u0305</i>, which is simply the mean of the row variable over the four columns. So, <i>x\u0305</i> is either the mean value of the replacement ratio or <i>itax</i> over the four categories of workers, depending on the row of the value of <i>x\u0305</i>.

Whereas social security social contributions for employees amount to 13.07% of gross income, this equivalent is 3.55% for pensioners unless the resulting taxable income drops below a minimum. For those receiving CELS benefits, the social contributions are 3.5% plus 3%, each conditional upon receipt of the same minimum level of taxable income. Moreover, tax rates increase by income band, so that the tax system by itself is progressive. In addition, those receiving a non-salary income (including a pension or a CELS benefit) are granted an additional tax exemption which, for example, equals 1612 euro for singles in 2003. All in all, those who are retired are subject to a favourable regime of taxes and social contributions. The relative gain from working over retirement therefore decreases, when expressed as an after-tax amount. Or, to put it another way, expressing the simulation results in gross instead of net amounts should result in the costs of postponing retirement to decrease. This is confirmed by <a href=\"#table9\">Table 9</a>. For the pension benefit, the average <i>itax</i> over the four categories of workers is 0.265 before taxes and 0.422 after taxes, giving a net implicit tax on working longer. The causes of this implicit tax can be sub-divided into a \u2018gross benefit effect\u2019 and a \u2018tax effect\u2019. The gross benefit effect, being the direct result of the pension scheme itself, accounts for 0.265/0.422 or 63% of the overall net implicit tax, with the reaming 37%, attributable to \u2018tax effect\u2019 of the state system of social contribution and taxation. For the CELS the contribution of the gross benefit effect to the overall net implicit tax is 0.593/0.789, or 76%, leaving 24% to be accounted for by the \u2018tax effect\u2019.",

If one\u2019s partner has no or limited revenues of his or her own, one can choose the \u2018family pension benefit\u2019 of 75 % of the wage-base. Also the minimum pension benefit increases by 25%. How does this change the above results? Is the implicit tax of working longer higher for those receiving a family pension benefit as compared to those receiving a single-beneficiary pension benefit? Of course, the average gross replacement rate of the pension benefit increases by 25% from 0.487 to 0.609. Likewise, the before-tax cost of postponing retirement increases: the average <i>itax</i> for the four types of employees increases by 25% as well, from 0.487 to 0.609. Similarly, one can expect the CELS benefit to increase, though not by as much as 25%. The general unemployment benefit (the first part of the CELS benefit) does not change. However, the fact that one is financially responsible for a partner without any income of his or her own has important fiscal consequences. In this case, 30% of one\u2019s income is taxed as if it were the income of the partner. As the tax system is progressive, this implies a reduction of the tax burden compared to a single individual. The net income that is the basis of the additional part of the CELS benefit increases, and so does the additional part of the CELS benefit. The average replacement ratio of the CELS benefit therefore increases, albeit only by 10% (from 0.614 to 0.657). The increase of <i>itax</i> is more important, namely 13% (from 0.593 to 0.672). This difference is caused by the fact that the implicit tax increases not only as a result of the increasing CELS benefit, but also of the increasing future expected pension benefit which the individual will receive after reaching the retirement age. The pattern of changes is comparable when considering after-tax amounts, though all changes are considerably smaller than the changes in before-tax amounts. This is because the increase of the gross amounts is partially taxed away by the progressive tax scheme.",

In this section, the impact of a later entry date is considered. Changing the length of the career has no effect on the CELS benefit, and a limited effect on the implicit tax of this scheme. For the pension scheme, one may expect both the replacement ratio and the implicit tax on working longer to decrease. <a href=\"#table9\">Table 9</a> contains the simulation results when somebody enters the labour market at the age of 25 and therefore becomes eligible for retirement after a career of 35 years instead of 40. The average gross and net replacement ratios decrease by 8.5% (0.446/0.487) and 8.3% (0.680/0.706). Gross and net <i>itax</i> decrease by 25% (0.199/0.265) and 19.3% (0.341/0.422). Why is the decrease of the latter so much stronger? This is because the pension benefit increases career length. An increase in career length of one year is more important in relative terms when one has a career of 35 years than 40 years. The relative increase of the pension benefit will therefore be more important, and the cost of postponing retirement will be lower. The conclusion, consequently, is that a shorter career comes with a lower implicit tax on working longer.",

The number of years that one should work in order to get a full pension would increase from 45 to 46 years for males, from 40 to 41 years for females joining a scheme before 2001, and so on. This clearly has no effect on the CELS benefit, and only a limited effect on the implicit cost of postponing CELS. The discussion will therefore be limited to the implications for the pension benefit. One can expect both the replacement rate and the implicit tax on working longer to decrease. <a href=\"#table10\">Table 10</a> shows that this indeed is the case, although the changes are limited. When taking the average over the four categories of employees, the gross replacement ratio decreases by 1.85%, from 0.487 to 0.478. The net replacement ratio also decreases, by 1.70%, from 0.706 to 0.694. The gross and net average implicit tax on postponing retirement respectively decrease by 12.35% (from 0.265 to 0.233) and 9.07% (from 0.422 to 0.384). Changing the required career has a stronger effect on <i>itax</i> than on the replacement rate, analogous to the results in the previous section. But the explanation is not the same. As the required career length increases, workers reach full career in a later year than before. Postponing retirement therefore has a greater effect on the pension benefit for all future years, and the gain of delaying retirement therefore increases, meaning that <i>itax</i> decreases.",
