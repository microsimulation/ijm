                "text": "Income is one of the key indicators to measure individual opportunities, regional differences, and societal inequalities. Previous research has shed considerable light on gender- and migration-related disparities at the national level. However, the regional distribution of these inequalities, especially over time, has received less attention. Moreover, how these regional inequalities might develop in the future or under different conditions remains unclear. Regionalized dynamic microsimulations provide a powerful tool to analyze individual, household, as well as local long-term income developments under \u2018what-if\u2019 scenarios. This contribution examines the potential regional dynamics in gender and migrant income gaps across the districts in Germany. We extend the data, model, and infrastructure of the MikroSim project with an income module that accounts for migrant groups. By simulating four independent scenarios, we can isolate and evaluate their unique effects on inequality dynamics within different regions. Specifically, we adjust the full-time employment rates and tertiary education levels for a) women to align with those of men, and b) immigrants to align with those of the majority population, separately for each district. The results show that the scenarios have regionally differing effects on inequality dynamics, highlighting the considerable potential of dynamic microsimulations for regional evidence-based policies.",

Income and wages provide important foundations for analyzing gender- and migration-related inequalities in measurable outcomes. Previous research has shed considerable light on the gender and immigration wage gaps across countries, while the regional research dimension of these differences has emerged more recently (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fuchs et al., 2021</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Schmid, 2022</a>).",

Second, historically grown disparities between the East and the West prevail even 30 years after reunification.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> Third, the labor markets in northern and southern Germany are structurally different. How these wage differences translate into regional pay gaps by gender and immigration remains unclear. In addition, the pay gaps depend to a large extent on the regionally varying characteristics of the local female and migrant labor force. The ratio and composition of ethnic groups differ between the regions in Germany, and the effect of migration background on earnings varies markedly by region (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hillmert, et al., 2017</a>). In urban areas, for instance, the migrant pay gap is found to be higher (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schmid, 2022</a>), whereas the gender pay gap in urban areas is lower than in rural regions (<a href=\"#bib12\">Busch and Holst, 2008</a>).

Information on regional income inequality in Germany is scarce, and even less is known about its development over time. In Germany, equality of living conditions has constitutional status. Therefore, it is essential for institutions and policymakers to know in which regions inequality is particularly pronounced and to anticipate how these inequalities might evolve in the future to design effective local policies. Hence, this paper focuses on the question of how gender and migration income gaps vary regionally over time, e.g., in terms of urban-rural and East-West differences. The simulation is conducted at the regional level, with income inequality modeled at the district level (NUTS 3) to provide insights into specific regional differences and dynamics.",

In addition, analyzing long-term income dynamics is important because the driving factors of income changes are entangled across domains, and demographic effects and reinforcement mechanisms may take time to appear (<a href=\"#bib61\">Richiardi and He, 2020</a>).

Even if female and male hourly wages were equal, significant discrepancies in the monthly earnings would persist due to strongly differing employment patterns of men and women. In addition, the wage differentials have consequences on individual career trajectories with implications for equality and poverty both during working life and into retirement, since current wage gaps manifest themselves in the pension gaps of the future (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dekkers et al., 2020</a>). To give a more comprehensive picture of gender gaps in earnings, the gender overall earnings gap (GOEG) measures the impact of the differences in average hourly wages, the monthly average of the number of hours paid, and the employment rate for men and women. With 42% in 2018, Germany is among the EU countries with the highest GOEG (<a href=\"#bib44\">Leythienne and P\u00e9rez-Juli\u00e1n, 2021</a>). Another branch in the literature examines gender differences in disposable and market incomes. Two opposing forces act upon the gender income gap. On the one hand, lower employment rates and fewer working hours among women combined with wage disparities widen the gap in overall earnings. On the other hand, the tax-benefit system cushions the gender imbalances in net income by redistributing between men and women (<a href=\"#bib30\">Haupt and Strau\u00df, 2022</a>).

Moreover, the international comparison estimates a \u2018double wage penalty\u2019 of nearly 21% for migrant women relative to non-migrant men in most HICs. A large part of the wage gap can be explained by individual characteristics such as human capital, age, and gender. Yet, even if all these measurables are taken into account, significant wage gaps remain in nearly all HICs, pointing to inequalities and potential processes of discrimination against women and migrants in developed economies (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amo-Agyei, 2020</a>).",

In addition, the results point to a severe \u2018double wage penalty\u2019 for migrant women in Germany, indicating even more labor market vulnerabilities for this group (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beyer, 2019</a>). <a href=\"#bib38\">Ingwersen and Thomsen (2019)</a> estimate significant and growing migrant wage gaps in Germany over time. They find that the average pay gap from 1994 to 2015 was 13.1% for naturalized immigrants and 14.8% for foreigners, whereas there are substantial differences between income deciles and immigrant groups. For example, while the migrant pay gap grows as income deciles increase, the unexplained part of the gap is higher for the lower-income deciles, indicating systematic wage inequalities in Germany. Furthermore, their results show that some migrant groups in Germany, such as Turks, immigrants from the former Yugoslavia or ethnic German repatriates, are more disadvantaged than Southern European immigrants (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ingwersen and Thomsen, 2019</a>). A further study estimates the monthly wage gap between the majority population and people with a migration background to be around 16.2% in 2018 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Statistisches Bundesamt and Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin F\u00fcr Sozial-Forschung and Bundesinstitut F\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsforschung, 2021</a>) while also finding severe pay gap differences between migrant groups: ethnic German repatriates and migrants from Southwest Europe earn the highest monthly wages among migrants, whereas Turks, immigrants from the former Yugoslavia, Eastern Europe, and refugees experience more significant median income losses. Thus, in light of the heterogeneous patterns of wage inequality by migrant groups in Germany, a projection of possible future developments in the overall migrant gap should account for these differences.",

Descriptive statistics, however, point to a regional aspect of immigration in Germany. There are considerable regional differences in the proportion of migrants in the total population: in western Germany, almost one in three people has a migrant background, whereas, in eastern Germany (excluding Berlin), this is the case for nearly one in ten people (2021: 30.5 and 9.0 percent respectively). Furthermore, there are significant differences in the ratio of immigrants between urban (2021: 33.8 percent) and rural (2021: 16.5 percent) regions (<a href=\"#bib65\">Statistisches Bundesamt, 2022</a>).

The best-known simulation methods in social science research are macrosimulations. Statistical offices mainly use macrosimulation for population forecasts (e.g., demographic change, developments in life-expectancy and care needs, or the future share of the working-age population). The used datasets consist of aggregate data, and the projection of the outcomes of interest relies on cross-tabulations of this contextual data. Yet, according to social science theory, the unfolding of social mechanisms and their development over time takes place on the individual level, whereas societal changes are the aggregated results of these individual developments (<a href=\"#bib15\">Coleman, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kalter and Kroneberg, 2014</a>). This also applies to all income-related statistics - it is the individuals who receive a monthly salary, get promoted, become unemployed, take parental leave, or retire. Thus, to simulate macro-level income dynamics and developments in inequality, the (causal) explanation can only be sought through the micro-level (such as individuals or households) and be derived based on individual characteristics. The method of microsimulation complies with these requirements (<a href=\"#bib57\">Orcutt, 1957</a>).",

Unlike static microsimulations, which can identify the short-term effects of a stimulus (e.g., the impact of a tax reform on different population groups), dynamic microsimulations can consider individuals over their life course. The unique feature of dynamic microsimulations is the data-driven projection of individual life-histories: the characteristics of the individuals are annually updated based on individual transition probabilities (<a href=\"#bib64\">Spielauer, 2011</a>). Actors in the dataset can have children, get older, become employed or unemployed, get married or divorced, or die. These characteristics reflect a life-cycle behavioral model (<a href=\"#bib36\">Holm and Rephann, 2004</a>). The individual-level empirical parameters can be estimated from social science studies with the help of nearly all conventional statistical methods: linear or logistic regression, longitudinal, or dynamic modeling (<a href=\"#bib69\">Post and Van Imhoff, 1998</a>).

As those aspects are of particular importance in the case of projecting income inequality, we will use the constructed regional base data and dynamic microsimulation modeling in our further analysis. The inclusion of the spatial perspective in the simulation process allows us to choose between different groupings of the analyzed individuals to present results at different higher levels (district, state, east/west, urban/rural, or national). Thus, through dynamic regional microsimulation, we can compare the outcomes in income between the regions in the same year. Additionally, we can focus on one geographical area over time, disaggregating the income development, e.g., by the immigration history or mean educational level. In addition to regional differences, we can take demographic changes in the composition of the population into account. This makes it possible to examine the interplay of causal individual-level mechanisms with compositional and contextual effects on the development of income inequalities.",

In other words, alignment ensures the consistency of the disaggregated inequality measures with known macro figures. However, the alignment also comes with challenges related to the data limitations, oversimplification, model complexity, and the potential of manipulation. In the case of MikroSim, the income module was not aligned due to the absence of adequate regional benchmarks, conceptual differences in available income measures, and to avoid further assumptions. Furthermore, if the survey income distribution and chosen benchmarks significantly differ and no data for distributional adjustments are available to make the two sources consistent, aligning the income module to income aggregates results in a change in income distribution. As a result, <a href=\"#bib54\">O\u2019Donoghue et al. (2013)</a> chose not to calibrate average incomes in their microsimulation model to national accounts totals. In addition, most of the microsimulation models reviewed in <a href=\"#A1-T1\">Table A1</a> and Section 3.2 do not calibrate income to known benchmarks. Alignment of income to growth assumptions or other projections is more commonly utilized in various models such as DYNASIM 3, MIDAS, T-DYMM, and CBOLT. DYNASIM 3 employs wage growth assumptions for future periods, MIDAS uses corrected growth rates and macroeconomic productivity assumptions, T-DYMM incorporates labor productivity growth and consumer price index, while CBOLT utilizes economic projections. In addition, a linkage of our MikroSim model with a macro model including labor demand is currently being tested.

In addition, the majority population is more frequently employed in government and white-collar jobs than the migrant population, while migrants are more likely to work part-time, further widening the income gap. Compositional effects that narrow the gap include the group-specific allocation in regional variables. Migrants are more likely to be located in areas with higher population density and in western and southern Germany, whereas fewer migrants reside in areas with higher unemployment rates and in eastern and northern Germany. This suggests that allocation dynamics play an essential role in moderating migrants\u2019 future incomes, which must be considered when projecting inequalities between the migrant and majority population.",

The migrant income gap is relatively stable over the simulation period, while it varies considerably by migrant groups. We find an inverted U-shaped migrant income gap: with a baseline of 13% in 2011 and a peak of 15% in 2019, the gap gradually decreases and is back to around 13% in 2040. This temporal dynamic in the migrant income gap goes hand in hand with the composition of migrant groups: the share of resettlers with relatively high incomes decreases, which increases the gap. In later years, however, the proportion of EU migrants with higher average incomes rises, which narrows and stabilizes the gap. The results are consistent with the heterogeneous income patterns of migrant groups in Germany known from previous studies (<a href=\"#bib68\">Statistisches Bundesamt and Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin F\u00fcr Sozial-Forschung and Bundesinstitut F\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsforschung, 2021</a>) and underline the importance of compositional dynamics for interpreting simulation results (see <a href=\"#A1-T6\">Table A6</a>). Furthermore, in the baseline scenario, the educational level of migrants is seen to increase in tandem with the educational level of the majority population (see <a href=\"#A1-F8\">Figure A8</a>). This progressive trend enables migrants\u2019 incomes to maintain pace with those of the majority population.",

While the migrant earnings gap decreases in both regions from 2020 onward in the baseline scenario, the decline is more substantial in the East and levels out the initial higher earnings gap in eastern Germany.

It is only in this further regional analysis by rural (left) and urban (right) areas that the scenarios unfold their different spatial implications. The steeper decline under the full-time scenario in West Germany shows an even higher reduction of the migrant income gap in the rural areas of West Germany compared to rural areas in the East. Moreover, equal higher education has only a marginal effect in urban areas, while in rural areas, the scenario has a more noticeable reductive effect on the migrant income gap.",

Although overall migrant income inequality is somewhat higher in urban areas, the compositional adjustment in Scenario 4 has a lower effect on these areas. This is consistent with previous research on wage differentials, which finds the highest wage differentials in urban areas (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schmid, 2022</a>) and among highly skilled migrants (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beyer, 2019</a>), further indicating a different utility function of education for migrants and the majority population. Thus, the dynamics of the migrant wage gap cannot be reduced universally by simply adjusting composition characteristics, suggesting that a change in individual factors may have an impact in some (here: rural) regions, while in others, job-related characteristics are additionally crucial.",

For migrant women, who often face a \u2019double wage penalty,\u2019 initiatives such as increasing the availability of childcare facilities, offering flexible work arrangements, and providing career planning support can be particularly beneficial. Migrants also encounter challenges due to the limited transferability of their qualifications, which can hinder their employment prospects and earning potential, especially in Germany (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aldashev et al., 2012</a>). To address this, improving the recognition and applicability of foreign qualifications is essential, enabling individuals to make informed career decisions based on their actual qualifications. This would unlock the full potential of the migrant workforce and reduce economic inefficiencies (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ingwersen and Thomsen, 2019, p. <span class=\"page-number\">20</span></a>). Moreover, migrants have a proportionally higher share of lower educational attainment, as depicted in <a href=\"#A1-F2\">Figure A2</a>, and often experience \u2019sticky floors\u2019 in terms of lower wages (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schmid, 2022</a>). Therefore, implementing targeted programs such as vocational training, language and literacy programs, and lifelong learning (<a href=\"#bib14\">Coca Gamito, 2022</a>) can play a significant role in reducing the income gap for migrants. Moreover, in urban areas, where diverging reduction potential in migrant pay gaps is observed (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), promoting pay transparency and strengthening anti-discrimination laws can help overcome the \u2019glass ceiling\u2019 faced by highly skilled migrants (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schmid, 2022</a>).",

Furthermore, research on earning differentials shows that women earn significantly less on average, even when controlling for the field of study (<a href=\"#bib43\">Leuze and Strau\u00df, 2009</a>), and that returns on education vary between the majority population, EU workers, and non-EU workers, with the latter having the lowest returns (<a href=\"#bib14\">Coca Gamito, 2022</a>). This could be a potential application area for future microsimulation analyses to eliminate differences in the returns from tertiary education between (a) women and men and (b) migrants and the majority population.
