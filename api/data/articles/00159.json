                "text": "Spatial microsimulation models have been in use for around 40 years for various applications. Responding to users\u2019 needs and project purpose, many have emerged using different methods and algorithms. Despite this, the literature suggests a gap in applications combining operability, flexibility, availability or generally an implementation of an online web mapping application in the area of spatial microsimulation. In this paper we introduce the development of a new open-source web-based spatial microsimulation framework, called simSALUD, as a solution approach for static simulation modelling where no programming skills are required. The emphasis lies on the design and implementation of the wizard and web-based spatial microsimulation application, including integrated validation and mapping elements. The current version supports two deterministic spatial microsimulation algorithms (combinatorial optimisation and iterative proportional fitting). The application is designed for experts as well as for non-experts to simulate their own spatial microdata. In addition, the application integrates statistical tools to validate and verify the robustness of the models ad hoc. The outputs of the simulation and validation results can either be visualized in the form of a map within the application or exported as comma separated files for further analyses. simSALUD comes with a demonstration dataset, an extensive documentation and video tutorial to disburden the usage of the software. The architecture of simSALUD was designed with the possibility to expand the tool towards a spatial decision support system, allowing measurement of possible future policy interventions on population groups at small geographies.",

                    "text": "Spatial microsimulation models are typically used to build up large-scale synthetic microdata based on individuals or households to produce unavailable data, so-called \u2018missing data\u2019, but they are not widely applied yet. One reason for that could be the absence of easy-to-use software, where programming skills are not obligatory. Therefore, the open-source application simSALUD<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> was developed within the project SALUD (SpatiAL microsimUlation for Decision support) funded by the Federal Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology and the Austrian Science Fund. SALUD was aiming to build a spatial microsimulation model (SMS) for Austria to support answering questions in health related areas. During that phase we have developed an application, named <i>simSALUD</i> that can be used internationally to contribute to the area of spatial microsimulation modelling. The open-source application is accessible via a website (<a href=\"http://www.simsalud.org/simulation\">http://www.simsalud.org/simulation</a>) to either use the simulation directly by connecting to a web link or by downloading and installing the application on a personal computer. In addition, a help tutorial is available that guides the user step by step through the application based on an example with downloadable dummy date. One of the advantages of this platform is to experience spatial microsimulation modelling by using it without spending time on reduplication of existing algorithms. This time can rather be spent on future improvements and developments or on using the modelled output data for more sophisticated analysis in distinctive disciplines, such as health science, transportation, crime analysis, or environmental studies, to name a few. The application is useful for people working with spatial microsimulation models or who would like to learn it, and can also be used for disciplines outside the area of health geography, such as economics and education.",

Existing applications are often based on programming languages (Java, Python, R, etc.) and often need expert knowledge not only in the field of spatial microsimulation, but also in programming and computer science. LIAM2, for example, provides a generic microsimulation toolbox to develop different kinds of microsimulation models. The tool is programmed using Python and uses the software Notepad++ to develop almost any microsimulation model as long as it uses cross-sectional ageing, i.e. all individuals are simulated at the same time for one period (<a href=\"#bib4\">De Menten, Dekkers, Bryon, Li\u00e9geois, &amp; O\u2019Donoghue, 2014</a>). Another open source tool is JAMSIM, where this standalone application is more a loose grouping of open-source packages to provide a base set of functionalities for microsimulation. JAMSIM combines the statistical package R and the Java-based Ascape for the creation of microsimulation models (<a href=\"#bib13\">Mannion, Lay-Yee, Wrapson, Davis, &amp; Pearson, 2012</a>). <a href=\"#bib8\">Kavroudakis (2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">2015b</a>) developed a SMS package, the spatial microsimulation library for the Statistical Programming Language R, which contains functions for preparing microdata from census and longitudinal datasets. An advantage of the library is that it uses multi-core approaches (use of parallel interface of R) to divide the main simulation process into smaller simulations, which then run in parallel. <a href=\"#bib7\">Harland (2013)</a> developed a Java-desktop based modelling framework called FMF (Flexible Modelling Framework), for creating synthetic populations using the method of simulated annealing. Another open source microsimulation platform is OpenM++ which is inspired by, and compatible with, Modgen (Model generator), a generic microsimulation programming language, (<a href=\"#bib17\">OpenM++, 2016</a>). A spatial microsimulation modelling application with a focus on predictive policy analysis is Micro-MaPPAS (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ballas, Kingston, Stillwell, &amp; Jin, 2007</a>). The framework was developed with a graphical user interface and access to various modules, such as data analyser, the mapping controls, and projection scenarios, but has not been developed in almost 10 years. <a href=\"#bib12\">Lovelace and Dumont (2016)</a> provide open-source code and working examples for spatial microsimulation modelling within the R environment to map results and to link them with other methods, such as agent based modelling. Also the platform JAS-mine is based on open-source tools that allow users to simulate data using agent-based and dynamic microsimulation approaches (<a href=\"#bib18\">Richiardi &amp; Richardson, 2017</a>). In summary, the development of software tools are of increasing interest and this direction is favourable for the wider community by sharing knowledge and applications around spatial microsimulation.",

This can hence lead to loss of time, therefore cost consuming investments, or to no use at all. Such things happen especially when tutorials about the coding and user manual lack detail or are unavailable. Also notable is that models and applications are often developed to solve a specific problem and therefore there is less time or consideration given to producing and sharing well documented algorithms and codes, which leads to time consuming reproductions. Spatial microsimulation publications often mention the usage of algorithms or methods, but the actual source cannot be retraced or understood. Therefore, researchers show their own equations, which differ, but in the end produce the same results (see <a href=\"#bib5\">Edwards &amp; Clarke, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">O\u2019Donoghue <i>et al</i>., 2013</a>). On the other hand the same method might be used with small adjustments, which cannot be retraced. When looking deeper into the literature it is noticeable that there is not a common language, meaning that there are many synonyms, e.g. constraints and predictor variables, which can be very confusing for novices and does not clarify the boundary of the discipline. In summary, it can be said that there are valuable but inaccessible or not expandable developments. Existing tools can lack user friendliness, flexibility or do not support mapping tools, where the latter can be especially useful for demonstrating the results and to explore the outcome <i>ad hoc</i>. Therefore, the motivation during this research project was to build, integrate and bundle existing knowledge into a new package, with a long-term thought to attract new people to the area of spatial microsimulation and to gain new scientific knowledge by building on existing and accessible sources.",

The latter was developed to make the application user-friendly and usable. The application is also designed to be expandable in future. Currently, there are two deterministic reweighting spatial microsimulation algorithms implemented from which a user can choose to estimate small area data, validate this data providing a choice of integrated statistical methods, and to map the simulation or validation results.

Therefore, the primary aim of the development of simSALUD within the research project was to have fast and easy access to the spatial simulation application, to build models, and to use the output for further spatial analysis to answer policy relevant questions. The development of such an application could be time consuming at first, but its continued usage, and possible future development, saves time and money in the long term. This is shown for instance by using the spatial simulation to spatially simulate the smoking prevalence at municipality level (<a href=\"#bib10\">Tomintz &amp; Kosar, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Tomintz, Kosar, &amp; Clarke, 2016</a>), or by <a href=\"#bib22\">Zm\u00f6lnig, Tomintz, and Clarke (2016)</a> who built a spatial microsimulation for diabetes using the application simSALUD. The time savings of not having to program a code from scratch allowed time to focus on building the model, spatially analyse the data of the modelling results and publish within a year.

Secondly, a focus was given to the usability of the application to overcome barriers of approaching the application, as this is necessary so that it can be easily operated by experts and novices (<a href=\"#s2-2\">Section 2.2</a>). Therefore, usability tests were carried out throughout the development phase, which is briefly introduced. Thirdly, given the fact that simSALUD is a web-based tool, a short workflow is introduced, which also includes uploading any data to the application. This is connected to privacy issues that are also considered.

Before starting the implementation with coding however, it is important to confirm its usability. Therefore, digital mock-ups were created on which the first usability tests were conducted. The advantage of this approach is to save time during the implementation process, as to change code and specific design architectural modules afterwards can lead to more difficulties and hence time requirements, which leads to increased costs (see <a href=\"#s2-2\">Subsection 2.2</a>).",

Before starting any coding we wanted to ensure that the application was user friendly, as otherwise the usage of it will not be guaranteed. <a href=\"#bib19\">Sommerville (2016)</a> argues that engineering is not simply a technical process and that the communication between software developer and customers/end-users is important from an early stage. There are different methods to test the usability of an application or website. Throughout the design and development phase, evaluations were applied using the usability tests after <a href=\"#bib14\">Nielsen (1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">1994</a>), which are <i>Thinking Aloud</i> and <i>Heuristic Evaluation.</i>",

An advantage of mock-ups is their reality of interaction and they can get sketched using traditional paper and pencil methods or digitally. We decided to use digital mock-ups as they allow the user to drag and drop, resize and rearrange elements, and make adjustments to the mock-ups without starting all over again. The integrated elements in the mock-up software packages can provide a clear picture of the application. For this project, the software Balsamiq was used (<a href=\"http://balsamiq.com/\">https://balsamiq.com/</a>), which allows digital rapid wireframing, as well as exporting the mock-ups as a portable document format (pdf). The first mock-ups were developed by the project team and evaluated by staff (experts) and students (novices) from the Carinthia University of Applied Sciences within workshops and teaching classes. For this purpose we applied the well-known usability tests by Nielsen, i.e. the ten Heuristics that is usually used by experienced users and the usability test Thinking Aloud to receive input from novices (which were students unfamiliar with this content and people outside University that were invited to participate). The ten Heuristics test was sent out to a selected pool of people that were classified as \u201cexperts\u201d, who reported their results back either on paper or electronic form. They have ranked issues found from minor to severe changes necessary. The Thinking Aloud tests were set up as labs where participants were guided through the process from one of our research team members. The entire process was video recorded and results were extracted, focussing on interactivity (how quickly can a user navigate from A to B; are all implemented features easy accessible and understandable) and less on the layout itself (i.e. which colour is most appropriate). The evaluation processes was performed iteratively on mock-ups. Based on that a beta version was implemented and tested, including cross-platform and device testing, and as a result a first stable and usable application for the simulation and validation tools within simSALUD (currently version 1.3) was provided online. Results are summarized in the Appendix to show the first set of requirements, which were continuously iterated and adjusted throughout the development process.",

As presumed from their names, the simulation wizard deals with verifying the input data and running the selected algorithm to produce the simulation results; based on the selection of the user, the validation wizard provides users with a range of methods to validate the aforementioned simulation results; the visualisation wizard joins the simulation or validation results (dependent on what users select) with the appropriate spatial data layer. One requirement of simSALUD is expandability which is important to define early on when it comes to system design (see <a href=\"#s4\">Section 4</a>). simSALUD can be expanded in different ways by adding additional modelling algorithms or by adding more spatial processing and visualisation tools. The web application is at version 1.3 at the time of writing and has two deterministic reweighting approaches embedded, combinatorial optimization (see <a href=\"#bib5\">Edwards &amp; Clarke, 2013</a>) and iterative proportional fitting (see <a href=\"#bib11\">Lovelace, 2014</a>).",

In its current version, there are two sets of input data required to run a spatial microsimulation model. The first requested data input is a single data file which is usually based on individuals with non-spatial information, such as data from cross-sectional surveys. The second requested data input requires a single file for each of the selected constraint variables including a spatial reference, which is usually an area code. The latter data sets are normally extracted from small area census data. All the aforementioned data files need to be prepared as comma separated values (csv) files following a template structure. The column names are not specified and can be chosen by the user. Attention needs to be given to columns marked with an asterisk, as they are mandatory to include in the data file regarding existence and arrangement. If this rule is violated then the user receives an error message that should help overcome this issue. Support is given by the application itself through help tooltips and help documents at each step and a \u201chelp\u201d document is provided too, guiding the user from the start to the end of the modelling process.",

A \u201cReset\u201d button was implemented so that users have the option to delete all their data files from the server at any time. In case the user does not delete its own files, another extra feature was implemented that automatically deletes all data files from the server every 24 hours to act as precaution. Another option to maintain data privacy is using a registration process and login function, where each user can administer their data. This option was not considered for implementation, as a login procedure would argue against an easy and fast access to the application. Another option is to download and install the application on the user\u2019s machine, so that all data files do not leave his or her computer. Also given the data requirements, confidentiality issues are usually less of a concern than issues of data purchase and permission use, this is further discussed in <a href=\"#s4\">Section 4</a>. The development team also put effort into the data validation process to detect and show errors in data files when uploading the input data to the system.

Informing users of what causes the problems, hindering the simulation to run, is an important concern so that users can easily adjust the data and try again. The better the interaction with users, the more likely it is that users will continue using the software. Usability evaluation tests (see <a href=\"#s2-2\">Subsection 2.2</a>) have helped to identify placing error messages where needed, as well as to define the content of the error messages). As mentioned before, the application tests if uploaded data files conform with the data structure required by the application to run the model, however, the user is responsible for accurate and robust model results himself according the data input quality and appropriateness.",

Before starting the application architectural design, an extensive literature review was done to identify the current state of the art for existing spatial microsimulation applications and best software and technology to use for the purpose of simSALUD. At the time of the development, no public web-based spatial microsimulation applications were available, except for single applications or modules (see <a href=\"#s1\">Section 1</a>). This encouraged the simSALUD team to develop the flexible and open web-based spatial microsimulation application with an easy-to-use graphical user interface and additional mapping functionalities. This is achieved by providing a generic wizard-based application that does not require the end-user to have background knowledge of a particular programming language. Furthermore, this could also allow experts and non-experts to focus more on specifying and interpreting the model than having to worry about the technical details of the application or with programming an application themselves.",

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, where the module <i>model</i> is responsible for business logic, the module <i>view</i> handles a user interaction within the application and the module <i>controller</i> controls the flow of the application (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). It is an extension of Java Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP). The choice to use the mature web application Struts2 was based on the advantages of its simplicity and collaboration in the concept for the Java EE platform. Struts is an open-source application developed by Apache Software foundation based on a set of Java technologies such as Servlet, JSP, XML etc. and follows the well-established MVC design pattern (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The controller\u2019s job (<i>controller</i> module) is to map (incoming HTTP) requests to the appropriate action. This can be done with a XML-based configuration file. The model (<i>action</i> module) mainly concentrates on the business logic and semantics of the application. The view is the presentation module of the MVC pattern and can be developed using JSP and other HTML technologies. The <i>view</i> module is responsible for getting the input from the user and rendering the result of that input, which is sent back to the user (client). Some advantages of the technology include easy plug-in usage (e.g. jQuery Javascript application), Ajax support (Struts2 tags are Ajax enabled), Tag support (Tags allow the developers to write less code), and a ready to use validation application.",

One of the newer Web-mapping APIs is the ArcGIS Javascript API, which was first released in 2008. The simSALUD developer team decided to use this technology together with ArcGIS Server for building maps, on the one hand for academic training purpose and on the other hand to demonstrate the differences to other web mapping APIs. The web map services are accessed via the ArcGIS REST API, which provides a relatively simple way to use services provided by ArcGIS Server. REST is an architecture style and enables the use of web resources by encapsulating information in the URL and query string of the request. ArcGIS Server includes a REST API for accessing services. The REST API is used in other APIs available with ArcGIS Server, including the stand-alone ArcGIS Server JavaScript API. The map service retrieves the data from the two defined data sources and joins it based on an identical unique ID in both datasets. The REST API returns the data in JSON where the Javascript API displays the map in the browser.",

This back-end REST API is able to retrieve information stateless from the server, which consequently runs the code in the browser instead of having to run it on the server. The challenge for the development of the simSALUD application was to join the simulated data with the spatial data stored in different databases. The interaction process to map the simulated and validated data is shown in the server architecture in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. In the current version of the application, the administrator has to import the spatial data (districts, wards, municipalities, etc.) into the geodatabase that allows access for the front-end by users. One limitation is that users currently have no access to add their own spatial data boundaries for mapping; only when downloading and installing the application on their own devices. The prepared spatial data is published as a map service. All web services have to be defined as a dynamic layer to dynamically add (join) the simulation results from the simSALUD file geodatabase to the spatial data (geodatabase), hence connecting both databases. Both databases (workspaces) have to be registered by the administrator and are assigned with an ID to uniquely identify the workspace within the pool of workspaces available to the map service. For the next version of simSALUD (when resources become available), it is planned to replace this process of registering the spatial data by the administrator with an upload form so that users are able to upload their own spatial data directly. After running the simulation and validation, the results are temporarily stored to the simSALUD database. The simulated data can be displayed on the visualization page, which means requesting the appropriate map service depending on the selected geographical data. This dynamic web layer is displayed on the top of the base map layer \u201csatellite tiles\u201d from ArcGIS. An additional external library allows for classifying the results based on equal interval, quantile and natural breaks classification methods. The ArcGIS Server also provides additional services such as networks services (service area) or other geo-processing services, which are interesting for future implementations. However, these services are not open-source and therefore alternatives need to be considered when offering a pure open-source solution.",

Expanding simSALUD by integrating additional algorithms is possible and can be added with appropriate programming skills; as well as shared with others to keep the open-source principle alive. Extending simSALUD for the next version can influence the layout and therefore a redesign might be necessary. Currently, the entire web portal is developed using a responsive web design (RWD) for optimal viewing across a wide range of devices. Some practical tests showed that using the application via small screen mobile devices (Smartphones) reduces comfort regarding uploading and matching the constraints.

Another useful, but still unsolved, function at this stage is the option for users to upload their own spatial data file to join with the non-spatial data (simulated or validated outcome data of simSALUD). At the current stage, both datasets are stored in different databases (non-spatial: PostgreSQL; spatial: PostGIS), where the spatial data is predefined based on a known unique ID that exists in both datasets.

It is challenging to determine the limits for map graphics that are appropriate for a map before performance starts to suffer and this is dependent on different factors such as client\u2019s browser or hardware. A solution for displaying points is much easier by using a raster surface, like a heat map, filtering the data through queries, or clustering, than using polygon data. Displaying polygon data, for example municipalities, is more complex because the smaller the geographical units, the more polygons there are for a particular area to computationally draw; for example one study area can consist of two districts but 400 municipalities. Smaller geographical units show more details that larger geographical units can hide, and this is the purpose when using spatial microsimulation to simulate data for small geographical units. Therefore when it comes to Web-based mapping, not only the number of polygons is important, but also the number of polygon vertices must be considered. The more polygon vertices are used, the more accurate the polygon draws the spatial boundary. However, the more detail, and hence increased amount of vertices, the longer the transfer time to the client which requires more resources. Possible solutions include rendering features depending on the appropriate scale or the integration of a Web Map Service (WMS) where the web server converts the polygon features to a raster (bitmap format), reducing the rendering process of the client.",

Another feature can included a tick-box where the user needs to agree to current terms of condition when using the application. This is not added in version one, but should be considered for possible future developments. In addition, a step-wise principle can be taken into account, meaning that some features are accessible without login procedures, whereas for others a login is mandatory. Another improvement regarding data protection for the next roll out would be online access to the framework via HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) instead of HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) only. HTTPS allows an encrypted communication between the website and the browser.

The web application, running on Apache Tomcat, is divided into three modules: simulation, validation and visualization. The simulation wizard guides users through the application, based on the chosen deterministic reweighting approach and an integerisation algorithm, where the latter is optional and aims to only allocate whole people to the final dataset. The validation wizard allows a user to validate the simulation results based on various implemented validation methods, such as TAE or simple regression. The results of the validation process can also be mapped within the application. The visualization wizard uses ESRI\u2019s JavaScript API and ArcGIS for Server for the map visualization. ESRI\u2019s JavaScript API, that is included within ArcGIS for Server, is based on the GeoService Representational State Transfer (REST). The GeoService REST Specification provides a standard way for web clients to request map, features, attribute, and image information from a GIS Server. All geographical data is stored into PostGIS database and stores all the spatial data that is offered for the map representation. In future, the implementation of a Web Processing Service (WPS) to extend the publishing and executing geospatial process for users with OGC standards is planned. An example is uploading a user\u2019s own spatial data and joining it with the user\u2019s simulation validation results.
