To address this question, we developed a non-behavioural microsimulation model, the Value Added Tax Simulation Model (VATSIM-DF II). The goals of VATSIM-DF (II) are to estimate actual and expected VAT revenues, assess the VAT incidence on households disposable income, and simulate the distributional effects of changes in fiscal policies in Italy. Compared to existing models, the main achievements of this study are: (i) the creation of a unique original dataset, which includes tax register data; (ii) the implementation of a matching procedure, based on Tax Register data, which outperforms other data fusion strategies used in the existing literature. These innovations allow us to create a reliable and unique dataset to simulate changes in VAT and to produce results consistent with the most updated macroeconomic data. We tested our model, at current VAT legislation, and we show the VAT burden on Italian households confirming the regressivity of VAT. Finally, we analyse the effect of a revenue neutral reform, with two VAT rates, which applies the reduced VAT rate also to female and babies sanitary products.",

One of the first works in Italy was due to <a href=\"#bib31\">Marenzi (1989)</a> who, relying on the SHIW (Survey on Household Income and Wealth) data, simulated the distributional effect of taxation in Italy. Then, in 1999, the Microsimulation Unit in the Department of Applied Economics at the University of Cambridge,<a href=\"#fn1\"> <sup>1</sup> </a> launched Euromod, a tax-benefit tool which covers 15 European countries, including Italy, that was then updated in 2017 with the creation of Euromod-ITT (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bourguignon et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Immervoll et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">De Agostini et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Ceriani et al., 2017</a>). In 2001, Baldini published a study about MAPP98, a static tax-benefit microsimulation model, based on SHIW and consumption data, which was then updated in 2009, by Baldini and Pacifico, to assess the dynamic effects of changes in personal income taxes in the labour market (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baldini, 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">Baldini and Pacifico, 2009</a>). In 2007, the Department of the Treasury, at the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance, developed the ITaxSIM (Italian TAXation SImulation Model) which relies on SILC data (Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) and focuses on the analysis of personal income tax, VAT, property tax, in-kind benefits and family allowances.<a href=\"#fn2\"> <sup>2</sup> </a> More recently, <a href=\"#bib2\">Arachi et al. (2012)</a> and <a href=\"#bib19\">Gastaldi et al. (2014)</a> built their microsimulation models to assess the effect of a shift from personal and corporate income taxes to indirect taxation. In particular, <a href=\"#bib19\">Gastaldi et al. (2014)</a> rely on an integrated dataset, produced by <a href=\"#bib35\">Pisano and Tedeschi (2014)</a> for their model (EGaLiTe). While <a href=\"#bib2\">Arachi et al. (2012)</a> updated a microsimulation model originally developed by <a href=\"#bib34\">Pellegrino et al. (2010)</a> to study the distributive impact of housing taxation in Italy. Another Italian micro-simulation tool is the BIMic model, developed by <a href=\"#bib15\">Curci et al. (2017)</a> at the Bank of Italy. BIMic originally focused on the budgetary impact and on the distributional effects of social security contributions, family allowances, social benefits, personal income tax and property taxes. Recently, <a href=\"#bib14\">Curci and Savegnano (2019)</a> extended the scope of BIMic by including the simulation of VAT to assess the effects of tax shifts from labour to consumption. Finally, at regional level, <a href=\"#bib30\">Maitino et al. (2013)</a> developed the MicroReg model, which is a static model aimed at assessing the effects of PIT and VAT.",

At the same time, we cannot be sure that households who incurred the expenditure in the last three months have (or don\u2019t have) done the same during other months of the year. To address this issue, we impute these durables expenditures as follows. First, we use a Probit model to calculate the probability of a household to have incurred in the expenditure of at least one of these durable goods, during the last three months, given a set of socio-demographic characteristics (total expenditure, age, household size, employment status and type of job, household type, residence region, number of sons by age group, number of women and men within the households). Now, households who could have consumed durables outside the survey reference period are identified. Second, through a regression model we estimate the amount of money that households, given their characteristics, could have devoted to buy durable goods. Third, we create a dummy variable equal to one when the predicted probability (calculated with the Probit model) to have consumed durable goods is positive and we sort households according to this probability. Finally, we impute to each household the yearly amount of expenditure they could have incurred in, by assigning them the regression estimated values plus a hypothetical value of expenditure referring to the nine months not tracked by the survey. This value, is not constant but, decreases jointly with the predicted probability of the household to have spent money for this group of durable goods. The imputation process stops when the average annual expenditure, calculated through this imputation, equalizes the average annual expenditure we could have obtained by simply multiplying quarterly expenditures by four. The great advantage of our procedure is that, by simply multiplying durables to obtain the yearly data we overestimate the expenditure for households who reported consumption and we obtain a huge standard deviation which does not reflect the standard deviation of the survey quarterly data. Conversely, using the imputation procedure we obtain a yearly data with a standard deviation similar to the original one and an average expenditure similar to the one calculated by multiplying the observed data. Now the expenditure is assigned, not only to households who declared it in the survey, but also to households who did not report durable goods consumption in the last three months but could have incurred the expenditure during the rest of the year. Once the total amount of durables expenditure has been imputed to these households, we should impute also the value of single expenditure items pertaining to this group of goods. Through a statistical matching, based on the Mahalanobis distance, and relying on the set of households characteristics mentioned before (namely, total expenditure, age, household size, employment status and type of job, household type, residence region, number of sons by age group, number of women and men within the households), we match each household with positive durables expenditures observed in the survey with the most similar household with positive durables expenditures not observed in the survey but imputed through the aforementioned procedure. To each household with the imputed aggregated value, we assign the monthly item expenditure value of the nearest neighbor household with observed values.

They show that the survey is more accurate for data related to income than for those about consumption, and this could lead to misleading results about saving rates. For these reasons, in microsimulation models, often SHIW is used as \u201cbridge\u201d dataset between SILC and HBS. Also, in this case there are several procedures available. According to <a href=\"#bib6\">Baldini et al.

Also, matching households by strata produces better results with respect to a matching without grouping observations (ibid.). <a href=\"#bib35\">Pisano and Tedeschi (2014)</a> tested both Propensity Score Matching (based on nearest neighbor algorithm with replacement) and Mahalanobis metric matching (coupled with propensity score), and then they select the latter procedure as it performs better.",

This difference may be caused by: i) tax erosion, because there are several income sources that are not in the Tax Register data (for instance, income from financial capital or, partially, from real estate) and we would need other datasets to have a complete picture of all the households income sources; ii) tax evasion in declared income (in particular, for self-employed income).

One of the most used is the Propensity Score Matching, a method originally developed by <a href=\"#bib37\">Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)</a> to identify a reliable control group in the setting of quasi-experimental impact evaluations. However, this technique can be used also to identify similar observations in the context of data fusion and can be based on the Euclidean distance (calculated through the propensity score) or on the Mahalanobis metric distance.

In <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a>, we show descriptive statistics about the common variables in HBS and SILC and we compare the two survey samples through a t-test.

This is due to the fact that in the SILC sample there are outliers with very high-income values, while in HBS sample there are not such extremely high values. While we can discard HBS observations who are not similar to SILC households, we cannot discard any SILC household because we need to keep the survey representative at the country level. Therefore, if there are SILC households that are very different from all the HBS observations, instead of discarding them, we compare them with the nearest HBS household even though it is not strictly similar. Finally, the most important aspect to be preserved after the matching are the variables distributions. In order to check whether distributions are preserved we show the Kernel density distribution of the most important income categories for SILC and HBS samples, before and after the matching (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).",

We show how we compute the core microsimulation variables (Section 4.1) and then we describe the outputs of a microsimulation for 2019 with current VAT legislation (Section 4.2). Currently, the Italian VAT legislation establishes: (i) the application of a super reduced rate of 4% for basic food items, some medical services, books and newspapers; (ii) the application of two reduced rates of 5% and 10% for other food items and some house maintenance services; (iii) the application of the standard rate of 22% for other assets; (iv) the VAT exemption for some categories of goods or services, such as education. The same asset may be subject to different VAT rates (i.e. for heating gas a reduced rate of 10% is applied for domestic uses and up to a certain consumption threshold; in all other cases, the standard rate is 22%).

Weights are used to obtain the consumption for each product for the 12 Coicop consumption function.

Transport, food, and non-alcoholic beverages are (jointly with housing, water, gas, electricity, and other fuels) also the goods that absorb the highest share of households income.

However, the high incidence of VAT on the lowest income deciles, can be due to two factors. The first one is usually related to under-reporting or misreporting errors in income data for the lowest deciles. To address this problem, we adjusted income by imputing unplausible low-income values to positive values (Section 4.1). The second one, is related to the use of current income instead of permanent income. Indeed, according to <a href=\"#bib20\">Gastaldi et al. (2016)</a>, in single-period analysis, findings about the regressivity of VAT may be upward biased by the presence, in the sample, of consumption smoothers, whose expenditure choices may not be affected by negative fluctuations in current income. The best option to check for this hypothesis would be to measure VAT incidence on lifetime income (<a href=\"#bib29\">Levell et al., 2020</a>), but this data availability is extremely limited. To overcome these issues, several scholars suggest relying on expenditure as reference value for VAT incidence (for instance, <a href=\"#bib1\">Adam et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, in some cases, and under the hypothesis of consumption smoothing, expenditure is used as a proxy for lifetime income. To account for this, we also estimate the VAT incidence on expenditure, and we found that, overall, the incidence curve is flat (<a href=\"#A6\">Appendix 6</a>,<a href=\"#A6-F1\">Figure A6</a>). However, using expenditure as a reference to calculate VAT incidence has its drawbacks. First, as argued by <a href=\"#bib32\">Mirrlees et al. (2011)</a>, since low-income households may face borrowing constraints to smooth consumption, the most important indicator for them is still current income. Second, while measuring VAT incidence on current income may lead to an overestimation of VAT regressivity, the use of expenditure, as reference value, may lead to an underestimation of VAT regressivity. Underestimating regressivity is much risky, as it could favour policies which can produce long-term detrimental effects on low-income households at risk of poverty.",

It is worth noting that the proposed application is an exercise to show how a reform of the VAT system may affect the VAT burden on households.

Also, we applied the VAT rate of 7% to some articles and products for personal care (such as, female sanitary towels and babies\u2019 nappies). In our simulation, we assign a VAT rate of 20% to goods and services which are currently subject to the standard VAT rate of 22%. <a href=\"#A7\">Appendix 7</a> (<a href=\"#A7-T1\">Table A7</a>) provides details about the changes we applied to existing VAT rates. The primary role of VAT is not to stimulate or discourage the consumption of certain types of goods, which is the goal of other types of fiscal measures.<a href=\"#fn25\"> <sup>25</sup> </a> However, in our simulation we take into account social, cultural and environmental considerations made in the past by policy makers. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> shows the results of our simulation in terms of VAT incidence in aggregate terms (see <a href=\"#A8\">Appendix 8</a>,<a href=\"#A8-F1\">Figure A8</a>, for further details). The simulation results show that the changes applied to VAT rates do not strongly affect the VAT burden on households, which is very similar to the one observed at current legislation. Indeed, in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, we report the difference in incidence between simulation and current legislation. Although the VAT burden on households is not subject to strong changes, we can observe that there is a slight reduction in incidence for low-income households and an even smaller increase in incidence for high income households. Most importantly, in <a href=\"#A8\">Appendix 8</a> (<a href=\"#A8-F2\">Figure B8</a>), we show that the VAT incidence, for food and non-alcoholic beverages, decreases for all households but it benefits most low-income households. The same applies to other sectors, such as clothing and footwear and housing, water, gas, electricity and other fuels. Conversely, the VAT burden on households visibly increases for restaurants and hotels, especially for low-income households.",

The resulting dataset (VATIC 2019) is a unique source of detailed data on income and expenditure, at the household level. Then survey data are adjusted to National Accounts data to obtain the most updated variables coherent with macroeconomic data. Finally, we provide the main microsimulation outputs. Indeed, thanks to this model, we can assess the actual and expected VAT revenue and the VAT gap. Most importantly, we estimate the level of regressivity of VAT in Italy, which is a crucial information to design policies able to account for the trade-off between equity and efficiency.",

From the one side, we wanted to produce a reliable microsimulation tool which can support Italian policy makers to design VAT related policies. From the other, we aimed at contributing to the existing literature by providing a microsimulation model with original features. Indeed, the value added of VATSIM-DF (II), with respect to the existing models, are: (i) the creation of a unique dataset with data on income and consumption with a very high level of reliability, since the matching procedure relies on tax codes and Tax Register data; (ii) the adjustment of survey data on income and consumption to National Accounts data at the year of the simulation, which makes our estimations on VAT extremely coherent with the most updated macroeconomic data. To the best of our knowledge, there are not existing models in Italy with these features and this makes VATSIM-DF (II) a promising tool for reliable microsimulations about the distributional effects of VAT. We show that the procedure we used to create the dataset VATIC 2019, outperforms other methods used in the literature about microsimulation models in Italy. Also, we show an application of our model by testing a revenue neutral reform with two VAT rates. The reform consists only of two rates: a reduced VAT rate of 7% and an ordinary VAT rate of 20%. In addition to other basic goods, the reduced VAT rate is also applied to female sanitary towels and babies nappies. We show that this reform does not strongly affect the VAT burden on households. Conversely, it benefits low-income households reducing the VAT burden for basic goods and services (e.g. food and non-alcoholic beverages; clothing and footwear; and housing, water, gas, electricity and other fuels). However, the VAT burden on households visibly increases for restaurants and hotels, in particular for low-income households. A further extension of the VATSIM-DF (II) model, which will be described in a forthcoming paper, focuses on the behavioural effects produced by tax-shifts and changes in fiscal policies.",

Indeed, while we adjust survey data to National Accounts, we do not consider differences across households, but we assume that the under-declaration is uniform among them.

Finally, we show the consumption distribution before and after the matching based on SHIW as bridge dataset (see <a href=\"#A1-F1\">Figure A1</a>). Comparing <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> (Section 3.2) and <a href=\"#A1-F1\">Figure A1</a>, we find that our matching procedure, based on Tax Register data, is more able to preserve the original consumption distribution with respect to a matching procedure based on estimated consumption.",
