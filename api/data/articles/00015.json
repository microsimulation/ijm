                "text": "Most industrialised societies face rapid population ageing over the next two decades, including sharp increases in the number of people aged 85 years and over. As a result, the supply of and demand for aged care services has assumed increasing policy prominence. The likely spatial distribution of the need for aged care services is critical for planners and policy makers. This article describes the development of a regional microsimulation model of the need for aged care in New South Wales, a state of Australia. It details the methods involved in reweighting the 1998 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers, a national level dataset, against the 2001 Census to produce synthetic small area estimates at the statistical local area level. Validation shows that survey variables not constrained in the weighting process can provide unreliable local estimates. A proposed solution to this problem is outlined, involving record cloning, value imputation and alignment. Indicative disability estimates arising from this process are then discussed.",

While researchers differ in their assessment of the likely budgetary impact of population ageing, it is already clear that population ageing will place increased pressure upon the social security, health and aged care budgets. Older Australians will require access to services that support them in their later life and help alleviate or slow the health and disabling effects of ageing.

This approach builds upon earlier work on spatial microsimulation that has occurred mainly in Europe (for examples see <a href=\"#bib20\">Huang and Williamson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Voas and Williamson, 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">Ballas and Clarke, 1999</a>). At NATSEM these spatial microsimulation modelling techniques are used to reweight sample survey data to the Census data for Statistical Local Areas, thus creating a synthetic unit record file of households for every small area of interest (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chin <i>et al</i>., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chin and Harding, 2006b</a>). The characteristics of interest unavailable in the census but available in the survey are synthesised at small area level by utilising both data sources. Validation to date suggests that the method has produced good estimates of housing stress, tax paid and poverty rates for each small area (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chin and Harding, 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chin <i>et al</i>., 2005</a>).",

Internationally, modelling of aged care systems has looked mainly at the fiscal implications of care provision, such as in the UK, where the CARESIM microsimulation model, at a national level, simulates long-term care charges by simulating the incomes and assets of future cohorts of older people and their ability to contribute towards care home fees or the costs of home-based care (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hancock <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>). Earlier work in the UK, by Williamson, looked at regional aged care needs (<a href=\"#bib30\">1996</a>) whilst, in Sweden, <a href=\"#bib21\">Lagergren (2007)</a> constructed a simulation model to simulate the future needs of long-term care of elderly persons. Within Australia, Access Economics has developed a microsimulation model of Residential Aged Care to consider policy implications. However this model does not consider those living in the community and does not have regional capacity. Access Economics has a second model, which is a dynamic cohort model, to look at the demand, supply and financing of aged care services.",

The 1998 SDAC had a sample of just over 42,000 persons to represent the Australian population and a sample size of just over 10,000 persons from New South Wales. The ABS does not release state geographic information on a CURF, except through remote access data laboratory (RADL). Survey data via RADL is not of use for microsimulation as it does not make available the unit records which are required for microsimulation. Thus, all records from the 1998 SDAC CURF were used in the CAREMOD simulation, as the specific records for NSW could not be identified. The advantages offered by using SDAC as the base file were that it contained information about the aged population living in non-private dwellings and about the disability status of the population living in private dwellings; it included a greater number of records of older people compared to other national surveys; and it provided greater information at a finer level of age groups in the older ages (such as 85+ years). These features were regarded as being of critical importance to the base data for a model for aged care.",

Information about economic factors was obtained from several sources. Income was based on the SDAC information, whilst wealth components were imputed from the Survey of Income and Housing Costs (SIHC) (for superannuation) and administrative data (for housing values).

The 2001 Australian census provides detailed regional socio-demographic information. However, as is the nature of a census, it did not collect detailed information about any one specific topic but collected limited information over a wide range of topics. Consequently, there was a lack of detailed data on health status, disability level, expenditure and income at a regional level. In contrast, SDAC contained very detailed information about disability and ageing but is lacking with regard to detailed geographic information. A small sample from each geographic area is taken to make up the complete SDAC sample so that, even if the location of the respondent was known, the calculation of direct estimates for SLAs would be unreliable due to large sampling error.",

The SDAC was reweighted against a range of benchmarks (including age, sex, relationship in household, tenure type, income and education) using tables from the 2001 Australian census. These benchmarks were selected from the set of variables <i>common</i> to both the SDAC and the 2001 Australian census. The reweighting variables were limited to those that were felt to adequately represent the socio-economic attributes of each SLA and address the main issues of concern \u2013 namely, the drivers of the need for care and the income and assets of older Australians, particularly functional status, need and ability to pay for care in terms of their income and assets (either directly or by being strongly correlated).",

Whilst these variables are not direct determinants of need for care they are proxy variables that have been found to be related to functional status. Using the 1998 SDAC, modelling was done to confirm which socioeconomic variables available on both SDAC and census were most strongly related to functional status. Logistic regression was used in the modelling. It was found that age, income, education and birthplace (significant at 0.01 level) were strongly related to living in a non-private dwelling. Similarly, age, education, birthplace and income (significant at 0.01 level) were strongly related to presence of moderate core areas restrictions.",

It is aimed at reducing the influence of records with large weights, which occurs due to the complex, clustered, stratified survey methodology used by the ABS to select participants. For example, if a record had a weight of 300 and our maximum acceptable weight was set to 100, then we would replace the original record with three cloned records, each with a weight of 100. Other than the record weight, all the other variable characteristics from SDAC for the cloned records remained unchanged. At this point, as the weights of the cloned records are required to sum to the weight of the original (donor) record, the revised dataset weights still summed to represent the Australian population (and to benchmark totals). The cloned dataset, however, provided the launch-pad for the introduction of greater population heterogeneity in the rarer disability variables via imputation. As implemented in CAREMOD the maximum weight used for cloning was 100. A weight of 100 was considered small enough to remove the \u201clumpiness\u201d of the unit record weights (i.e. to ensure that a record with a large SLA weight did not unduly bias the process of imputing disability status), but not so small as to create an excessive computing burden.",

Consequently, it was decided that the model would be aligned with the SDAC percentage of persons with at least a moderate disability. Correction of the overestimation of functional status variables was done by scaling the imputation probabilities calculated, so that fewer records were allocated to certain characteristics in the Monte Carlo simulation. This adjustment was done assuming that the over-estimation was spatially homogeneous and as such the correction was applied equally across the SLAs. The scaling factor used was 13.4/9.6. It was scaled by the fraction of overestimation that occurred between the original SDAC estimate and the weighted average estimate from NSW SLAs produced by our regression models. This centred the SLA estimates around the NSW estimate. Use of a scaling factor meant that if record A was more likely to have a disability than record B this relationship would remain \u2013 but the chance of either record having a disability would be reduced. This method gave an objective way of reducing the number of records that had a disability when using the SLA weights.",

However, as an outcome of early scoping work, it was decided that the ABS Survey of Disability, Aging and Carers would provide a better base data for CAREMOD. So although seen as a relatively high risk decision, regionalisation of the 1998 SDAC survey was undertaken.",

To improve the reliability of the imputation, first records were cloned so no record had a weight of more than 100, thus allowing finer graduations of disability states to be achieved. This complex cloning was necessitated by the relatively \u201cclumpy\u201d weights created by the reweighting algorithm (GREGWT). Cloned disability-related attributes in the SDAC were then replaced with imputed values in order to increase the heterogeneity of disability outcomes. The initial attempts at imputation resulted in the estimated proportion of persons with at least a moderate core restriction in NSW being 40 per cent higher in the synthetic data than the SDAC showed for Australia. Hence, all the relevant probabilities were \u2018scaled\u2019 down, so as to hit the \u201ccorrect\u201d proportion as shown in the SDAC data. After these refinements, the CAREMOD model appeared to provide reasonable estimates of the number of NSW residents with a core area restriction in each of the areas of mobility, self care and communication.",

The rationale for building CAREMOD was to be able to provide much more detailed answers to possible questions about the current and likely future need for, affordability of, and private and public capacity to fund aged care for older Australians. The small area forecasting capabilities of CAREMOD offer a new spatial estimation tool to assist in forward planning and decision-making on service provision, including what types of services are needed, what balance will be needed between formal and informal care, where should services be located and how could the costs of these services be met by Government and users.",
