The results show that the cohorts, who established the pay-as-you-go system in 1967, experienced a substantial gain by letting future generations pay. As a result of the pension reform from 2011 future pension benefits will be tightened. With a positive net rate of interest cohorts born between 1950 and 1980 are those who are most hurt by the reform, while cohorts born after 2000 gain.",

Securing of incomes after retirement from working life and insurance against the consequences of getting disabled before retirement age are probably two of the most important elements. A public pension system financed pay-as-you-go normally will redistribute incomes within and between generations. Emphasis in this paper is put on distribution between generations caused by the public pension system in Norway. As pointed out by <a href=\"#bib9\">Feldstein and Liebman (2002)</a> mapping of distributional effects is an important element in an overall discussion of the trade-off between protection and distortion when designing a pension system. Especially, it has been important in the discussion around the Norwegian pension reform from 2011.",

To obtain an overall view of distributional effects of the pension system between different birth cohorts, it is relevant to compare expected discounted pension contributions from labour market earnings for each cohort over the life course with discounted sum of pension benefits each cohort is expected to receive. If the size of the different cohorts is roughly constant, pension expenditures in a matured system also stay rather constant. When pension expenditures are financed pay-as-you-go there also has to be a close correspondence between contributions paid and benefits received for each cohort. But the first cohorts covered with benefits from a pay-as-you go pension system normally will receive higher benefits than what follows from their contributions. Reforms of the pension system may also affect the ratio between discounted life time pension benefits and discounted life time contributions. With population growth, it may be possible to let the sum of benefits each generation receives be higher than their contribution.",

The comprehensive need for a lot of details from past and future data is a major reason why there are few examples of this kind of analyses in the economic literature. Generational Accounts based on methods developed by <a href=\"#bib1\">Auerbach, Gokhale, and Kotlikoff (1991)</a> is one of the most common methods used to analyse distributional consequences between different generations from given levels of government revenues and expenditures. A recent analysis for the Netherlands is published by <a href=\"#bib3\">Bettendorf <i>et al</i>. (2011)</a> incorporating generational accounts in a model with overlapping generations.

For this purpose we extend Statistics Norway\u2019s dynamic micro simulation model MOSART, documented by <a href=\"#bib10\">Fredriksen (1998)</a>.

By micro simulation it is possible to take into consideration that different parts of the population face different rules. Substantial problems of aggregation to calculate effects on government budgets and to analyse overall distributional effects are rather easily handled. The main strength of micro simulation is to represent a socioeconomic system by a sample of decision units and then model different events, which these units may be exposed to. Contrary to what is possible in a macroeconomic approach, detailed and complicated tax and benefit rules may be exactly reproduced. However, it is rather costly to establish a detailed microsimulation model, and access to administrative data for the events covered is necessary. Using a representative aging approach by i.e. birth cohort, gender and occupational characteristics as in <a href=\"#bib2\">Belloni and Maccheroni (2013)</a>, may therefore be a good approximation even though it is impossible to include as many details by this approach as possible with microsimulation.",

Although a main emphasis in <a href=\"#bib20\">Nelissen (1995)</a> is on redistribution in lifetime incomes within cohorts, he also looks at changes in redistribution between cohorts born in 1930, 1940, 1950 and 1960, respectively. <a href=\"#bib23\">Pettersson <i>et al</i>.

Based on detailed information from the Norwegian Population Census, available aggregated data from 1960 is the earliest possible starting point for the simulation.

A total fertility rate of 1.87 and net immigration shrinking from the existing level of more than 40,000 persons towards 10,000\u201315,000 persons per year in the long run imply a continual growth in the younger part of the population in the first decades.

By this agreement it became possible for wage earners in the private sector covered by the scheme to retire at the age of 66. The scheme was gradually spread to other collectively agreements including the Government sector, and the earliest possible retirement age was gradually reduced to the age of 62. All employees in the Government sector and about 60 per cent of the employees in the private sector are covered by the agreement. Before the reform of the system for old-age pensions in NIS in 2011, early retirement was possible with hardly any consequences for future benefits from NIS after the age of 67.",

This means that divisors for adjusting for retirement age and remaining life expectancy for each cohort are calibrated against the divisors for persons born in 1943 retiring at age 67 in 2010. Early retirement thus leads to lower annual benefits. Lower benefits caused by higher life expectancy may be counteracted by postponing retirement. Statistical observations for the first years after the reform and econometric analyses based on these observations by <a href=\"#bib16\">Hern\u00e6s, Markussen, Piggott, and Roed (2016)</a> already show that the reform has led to postponed retirement (in the sense working longer).",

A guarantee pension of 2 BPU for singles and 1.9 BPU per person for couples secures a minimum level of benefits for pensioners with low labour incomes. The guarantee pension is means-tested with 80 per cent against income entitlements, and even persons with small incomes will obtain a level of pension benefits somewhat higher than the minimum level as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. In this figure the connection between annual pension benefits and former labour incomes is shown with the new and the old system for a single person with constant labour incomes during a period of 40 years. Annual benefits are shown before taking life expectancy adjustments into account, and thus represent the system for accumulation of entitlements. A ceiling on annual incomes for full accumulation of entitlements at 7.1 BPU in the new system compared to 6 BPU in the old system means that especially persons in this interval gain from the change in the accumulation model. However, for annual incomes between 7.1 and 12 BPU the former connection at the margin between labour incomes and accumulation of entitlements is eliminated. More comprehensive analyses documenting horizontal distributional effects as a result of the reform in <a href=\"#bib4\">Christensen <i>et al</i>.

This method provides a full set of simulated income data for every person in the grown up population born in 1943 (and thereby 17 years of age in 1960) or later.

The first comprehensive econometric analyses of immediate effects on retirement by <a href=\"#bib16\">Hern\u00e6s <i>et al</i>.

Because the reform of the pension system for employees in the Public sector in the first round did not turn out to follow the model from the private sector, retirement behaviour for this group does not seem to be much affected. Based on more preliminary considerations <a href=\"#bib11\">Fredriksen and St\u00f8len (2011)</a> calculate the average immediate effect on retirement above 0.2 years while an average worker (included those working in the Public sector) may postpone the retirement age by 0.5 years for each year life expectancy increases. Remaining life expectancy at the age of retirement is expected to increase during the whole period of simulation, but with a slower degree towards the end of the period than in the beginning. As a consequence of the actuarial design of the new system, uncertainty regarding the impact on the sum of future pension benefits is smaller than the effect on retirement age.

Due to the pension reform, growth in average contribution rate for old-age pensions will be smaller. This contribution rate is estimated to reach about 17 per cent in 2050 and stabilize about 19 per cent towards the end of the period of simulation. Further growth in expenditures as a result of increasing life expectancy is counteracted by the new system.

While this assumption is appropriate for indexation of accumulated entitlements in NIS, it is not suitable when comparing present value of contributions with present value of benefits, or in more general analyses of sustainability in public finance. By assuming that the net rate of interest is zero, what happens today is of no importance compared to what happens in the future with an infinite horizon. For example, a weakening of the government budget today may give an advantage to the tax-payers or the users of government services and pension benefits in the short run that is never counteracted in the long run because a deficit in public finances may be pushed to infinity. If the net rate of interest is zero, there will therefore be no budget constraint by this approach. It is not obvious what net rate of interest that should be chosen, and we will show that the results are highly sensitive for the choice. A common practice in Norway, also used by the Ministry of Finance to calculate present values of contributions and benefits in the so called Generational Accounts, has been to assume a net rate of interest of 1.96 per cent corresponding to a yearly growth in real wages of 2 per cent and a real rate of interest of 4 per cent.",

In some years after 2010 net immigration has increased to above 40,000 persons per year, corresponding to more than 0.8 per cent of the entire Norwegian population and 70 per cent of a birth cohort.

Therefore several of the figures below are constrained to natives, i.e. persons resident in Norway since the age of 17. In some figures we have shown the difference between natives and immigrants.

Due to still low labour market participation rates for Norwegian women up to the 1970s, maturing of the system had a significant effect for average gross pension wealth for cohorts born up to the beginning of the 1960s. Increasing life expectancy also causes average gross pension wealth to increase for almost every cohort, but the effect is reduced by discounting and the fact that a greater part of the increasing life expectancy for later cohorts occurs at higher ages.",

Introduction of the former pension system in 1967 also had a more immediate effect for this group compared with the group with only primary school because a transition rule rewarded those cohorts born between 1920 and 1940 with high and stable participation in the labour market. The pension reform from 2011 causes a slightly falling level of average discounted gross pension wealth for younger cohorts with long tertiary education. Longer life expectancy, than for persons with low education, is the main reason why the graph has a more negative slope. Although persons with long tertiary education normally retire later than persons with primary school, longer life expectancy normally also means that they have more years as retired. Therefore their discounted pension wealth by the age of 62 is more hurt by indexing pension in payments less than wage growth than what is the case for persons with primary school. More years up to retirement for persons with long tertiary education compared to persons with primary school as their highest completed education also means a larger reduction of the present value of future pension benefits at age 62 for the latter group. Also note that a strong growth in the level of education from the cohorts born in the first part of the former century up to the cohorts born in the 1980s means that the graph for long tertiary education is far more representative for the whole population for the later cohorts compared to the older cohorts where the graph for primary school is the most representative.",

Because of smaller redistributive elements in the Dutch pension system, the difference between men and women regarding net benefits from the old-age-pension system is lower than in Norway. If we had included disability pension, redistribution from men to women in the Norwegian pension system would have shown up to be even stronger because a greater share of women than men receives this pension. However, men are somewhat better off than women as a result of the pension reform mainly because the ceiling for full accumulation of pension entitlements is somewhat increased. This is especially the case in the long run for the younger cohorts. But also the new system means a considerable redistribution of incomes from men to women over the life course.",

Although <a href=\"#bib20\">Nelissen (1995)</a> reports that the Dutch old age pension system over the life cycle redistributes incomes from high educated to low educated, the degree of redistribution seems to be much higher in Norway.

Estimated growth in contribution rates with the old system shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> indicates that this assumption is far from obvious. <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> also shows that cohorts born after 2000 will gain from the reform with a net rate of interest of 2 per cent because the value of contributions as young is more worth than the corresponding value of benefits received as old.",

Fewer cohorts lose from the reform, and the loss is smaller compared to the calculations based on a net rate of interest of 2 per cent. Cohorts born after 1980 gain from the reform, and the gain is larger compared to calculations based on a smaller rate of interest. On the other hand, based on an assumption of a zero net rate of interest, no cohort gains from the reform during the period showed in the figure. Only natives are included in the presented series, and by prolonging the calculations we have checked that this group will experience a positive net gain from the reform in a longer perspective even with a zero net rate of interest. Also with a zero net rate of interest cohorts born between 1950 and 1980 are those who lose most. In the real world a situation with net rate of interest equal to zero is not sustainable in the long run. In this case there will be no budget constraint for the government. A large deficit now could be transferred into infinity.",

Because the main aim of the reform is to counteract future growth in old-age pension expenditures caused by further growth in longevity, the tightening effect is highly dependent on this component. But although tightening for the cohorts born between 1950 and 1980 will be stronger if longevity grows more than assumed in the main alternative, the gain compared with maintaining the old system will also be stronger for the cohorts born after 2000. Although uncertainty regarding the effects on retirement age, and thereby the effect on labour supply, from the reform is rather large, the analyses by <a href=\"#bib12\">Fredriksen <i>et al</i>. (2015)</a> show that the effect on old-age pension expenditures is relatively small. The actuarial system means that those who retire early are punished with low yearly benefits, while those who postpone retirement are rewarded with high.",
