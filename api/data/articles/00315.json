First, we estimate the price elasticity of electricity and heating demand. Then, within the framework presented in <a href=\"#bib1\">Faiella and Lavecchia (2021b)</a>, we compute the variation between 2020 and 2022. Second, we study how those variations affected households\u2019 financial vulnerability, based on an extension of the modeling strategy proposed by <a href=\"#bib2\">Faiella et al. (2022)</a>. Our results indicate that if energy price elasticity is not duly accounted for, financial vulnerability rises excessively following an energy price upsurge. However, when consumption rebalancing is taken into account, financial vulnerability remains rather low and in line with the supervisory data. While the risks for financial stability associated with energy shocks are therefore limited, this occurs at the expense of household consumption and welfare.",

In 2022, instead, debt at risk increases across the three scenarios considered (to between 8.15 and 8.62 per cent, from 7.9 in the baseline), with the stronger increase occurring when the energy price upsurge is measured by the NIC Index. The contained increase in 2021 reflects the fact that energy price variations are subdued in the years 2020-2021, while they are more marked in 2021-2022. While at first sight, such increases may appear to be low, they are not: in fact, they mark up between 3 and 11 per cent increase from the baseline in 2022. This non-monotonic pattern in vulnerability, however, does not correlate well with actual financial evidence, according to which the new non-performing loan rate has not been spiking in the wake of the energy price shock and, even more important, it has decreased between 2021 and 2022 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bank of Italy, 2023</a>).

This confirms that vulnerable households adjust their consumption expenditure in such a way as to maintain the level of disposable income as stable as possible so that it is also available for debt repayment.<sup><a href=\"#fn8\">8</a></sup> Looking at the heterogeneity results, we find very minor differences across scenarios.

Under the second viewpoint, there are, literally, hundreds of estimates of price elasticity, although most of them are based on US data. <a href=\"#bib16\">Espey and Espey (2004)</a> report a meta-analysis of 36 papers, with more than 123 short-run and 96 long-run price elasticity estimates of residential electricity demand; in the short run, price elasticity ranges between -2.01 and -0.004 (mean: -0.35), while in the long run, elasticity ranges between -2.25 and -0.04 (mean: -0.85). <a href=\"#bib17\">Labandeira et al. (2017)</a> carry out a meta-analysis for a dozen <i>surveys</i> on energy demand, again with mixed results, depending on the fuel considered and the time frame; as for electricity, elasticity is equal, on average, to -0.126 in the short run (-0.365 in the long run), while for natural gas it is equal to -0.180 in the short run (-0.684 in the long run). However, most of these studies are based, to different extents, on data from the United States, whose power sector is significantly different from Italy\u2019s, along several dimensions, including in terms of market structure, prices and energy demand. In particular, the average American household consumes four times as much the amount of electricity as an average Italian household,<sup><a href=\"#fn9\">9</a></sup> with a significant contribution of electricity for space heating (one-third of all homes in the US appears to be fed by electricity for heating purposes, compared with an almost non-existing share in Italy).<sup><a href=\"#fn10\">10</a></sup>",

They also show that elasticities for electricity and natural gas (at the national level equal to -0.705 and -0.621, respectively) are higher in the Centre and the South.

However, consumption in the above-mentioned areas increases one-to-one with prices. The authors estimate that in 2022 the share of households with the high cost of living adjusted debt service ratios (DSRs) on either their mortgage or consumer credit remained significantly below pre-global financial crisis peaks and they were not projected to increase substantially in 2023.

Starting from the early-2000s, Italy transposed the so-called \u201cfirst energy package\u201d into law,<sup><a href=\"#fn12\">12</a></sup> and initiated a process of liberalisation of the internal markets for electricity and gas, beginning with supply to large corporations. Since then, a slow process of market liberalization started and it is currently ongoing. However, as the production and distribution of electricity and gas were opened up to new entrants, the mechanism of final price determination for households was not left totally up to full competition (<a href=\"#bib26\">Stagnaro et al., 2020</a>). Since 2009, households can choose between the regulated tariff, set up quarterly by the energy regulator (so-called \u201c<i>Maggior tutela</i>\u201d), or a price offered by suppliers in the free market. At the end of 2022, almost 60 per cent of the electricity and gas bought by households was supplied by operators in the free market, with the share in the regulated markets continuously declining. Unfortunately, there is no data on energy prices at the household level, a major drawback hindering all analyses in Italy. To explore the energy price variations, in this work, we will use three different (aggregate) data sources: 1) the regulated tariffs set by the energy regulator (<i>Maggior tutela</i>);<sup><a href=\"#fn13\">13</a></sup> 2) the electricity and natural gas components of the price index (NIC) produced by Istat, which is further disaggregated between regulated and free market;<sup><a href=\"#fn14\">14</a></sup> 3) the semi-yearly, weighted, average unit cost for electricity and natural gas, collected by Eurostat for each member state.<sup><a href=\"#fn15\">15</a></sup>",

To this end, we divide all the prices by the electricity and natural gas components of the HICP index for 2015. In this way, we can calculate how many times energy prices have risen concerning the base year. Moreover, given the high variability of prices, we compute the variations by taking yearly averages.

Approximately EUR 119 billion was earmarked between 2021 and 2023 to counteract this surge, with EUR 28.8 billion allocated specifically to households only and EUR 31.7 billion to households and firms combined.<sup><a href=\"#fn17\">17</a></sup> For households, mitigation policies took two forms: 1) general, non-targeted price support measures, such as reduction of excise duties on fuels, VAT reduction on gas, and cuts in general system charges for electricity and gas; and 2) means-tested transfers, i.e., \u201cbonus elettrico,\u201d \u201cbonus gas,\u201d along with one-off conditional cash transfers of EUR 200 and EUR 150 in July and November 2022, respectively. Evidence suggests that the regressive impact of the price surge was partially offset by these mitigation measures, especially the targeted approaches (see <a href=\"#bib27\">UPB, 2023</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Bonfatti and Giarda, 2024</a>). While our price data inherently encompasses the general price support measures, we could not incorporate the means-tested transfers due to a lack of household income and wealth data. Consequently, our analysis partially accounts for the government\u2019s support during this period.",

First, we use disposable income (growth) from the national accounts (<i>Contabilit\u00e0 Nazionale</i>, CN), which includes imputed rents and is aimed at capturing the standard of living of households.<sup><a href=\"#fn29\">29</a></sup> After plummeting in 2020 as a consequence of the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic, income rebounded in 2021 (its growth was 3.5 per cent) and accelerated further in 2022 (at 6.3 per cent); income expansion is projected to soften in 2023, but to remain moderately positive. Second, we make use of the historical evolution and projections of lending to households for house purchases and for consumer credit - which are from the Bank of Italy\u2019s statistical data warehouse. Mortgages growth was high in 2021 and 2022 (at around 5 per cent in both years) but it was expected to slow down sharply in 2023; a similar trend, although somewhat more subdued, is shown for consumer credit (granted by banks).<sup><a href=\"#fn30\">30</a></sup> We use actual data and projections of the three-month Euribor obtained from futures contracts to recalculate payments of households holding a variable interest rate mortgage and those associated with new originations. At the same time, we exploit the 10-year IRS as a benchmark for fixed-rate new mortgages. While in 2021 the Euribor further declined to -0.547 per cent (annual average), it was slightly positive in 2022 (0.343 per cent) and was expected to increase sharply in 2023. On average in 2021 the IRS stood at little more than zero per cent, but increased sharply in 2022 (to 1.9 per cent); for 2023 the IRS growth could be slightly lower. We finally exploit both HBS data to compute the change in consumption expenditure by stratum and the macroeconomic projections on yearly growth of final consumption from the internal Bank of Italy macroeconomic model to generate aggregate consumption dynamics in the model similar to those observed in the data. The yearly variations in final consumption are around 5 per cent in the year 2021-22 and are projected to be lower in 2023.",

We then take on board such shocks by applying the energy price changes. We repeat this exercise in two cases. In the first one, households do not adjust their consumption bundle to price increases and keep consuming the same quantities of energy goods despite the price shock, i.e. we assume no price elasticity; in the second case, households change their consumption habits to fight back against price hikes, i.e. we use previously estimated price elasticities per stratum. Given the lack of more granular information on prices, we assume that in each scenario all households face the same energy price increases, which is likely not the case in reality. This renders the results of the exercise an upper bound for households\u2019 vulnerability since, in the spirit of a stress test, as we have seen above in Section 3, the majority of consumers have multi-year contracts.",

In 2021, across the different scenarios that account for the energy price shocks, reductions in disposable income concerning baseline are contained (between 60 and 320 euros).

The decrease in disposable income, by limiting the available financial resources that can be used to service the debt, hurts financial vulnerability. In 2021, in the three scenarios, financial vulnerability is about the same as the one recorded in the baseline scenarios, reflecting the contained growth in energy expenses. In 2022, instead, debt at risk increases with respect to 2021 across the three scenarios considered. The increase turns out to be stronger when the energy price upsurge is measured by the NIC Index - which recorded the highest increase - but, under any scenarios, we observe the same dynamics. This non-monotonic evolution of the debt at risk is inconsistent with the one for the new rate of non-performing loans, which continued to decrease in 2021 and 2022, highlighting that some important readjustment has taken place in actual data.",

                    "text": "Against this backdrop, we have developed a microsimulation model to evaluate the impact of the upsurge in energy prices on households\u2019 financial vulnerability. This paper builds on previous works of <a href=\"#bib9\">Michelangeli and Pietrunti (2014)</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Attin\u00e0 et al. (2020)</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Faiella and Lavecchia (2021b)</a> and <a href=\"#bib2\">Faiella et al. (2022)</a>. For the period 2020-2022, we show that by turning a blind eye to consumers\u2019 behavioural responses (i.e. assuming price inelasticity, a common assumption in the literature), households\u2019 financial vulnerability may be significantly overestimated and its dynamics are not aligned with banks\u2019 supervisory report data on the new rate of non-performing household loans. Conversely, by taking energy demand price elasticities into due account along with the evolution of the relevant macro variables, we find that the increase in the number of vulnerable households (and their associated indebtedness) is comparable to the rise recorded in a scenario where energy prices do not change and more in line to what has broadly occurred in reality. This is because households readjust their energy consumption levels (i.e., they trim their use of electricity and heating) to maintain a constant level of disposable income so that it can be used to service their debt.",

First, and foremost, we performed a partial equilibrium analysis focused on energy markets only and the impact of energy price increases on household financial vulnerability; as a consequence, this exercise has to be interpreted as a stress test. Second, we are aware that there are differences in elasticity values in the presence of price rises or falls and that the 2021-22 episode marked an inflation spike not recorded in many years; at the same time, the nearness of the price surge to the current date prevents the availability of newer data; in addition, its short duration suggests that it would be safe to assume an unchanged energy price elasticity before and after the price spike. At the same time, in light of the magnitude of the price shock, structural breaks in elasticity can not be ruled out. Be as it may, in case of higher elasticity, we would converge towards a case with limited effect on households\u2019 financial vulnerability, but heftier repercussions on welfare. Results would be still driven by the evolution of macro variables. Finally, we are focusing on energy expenditure, but other consumption items, such as food items, incurred large price increases. However, assessing a rebalancing in households\u2019 consumption basket would require information on cross-price and income elasticities for any goods. This information is not available at the current stage and we leave it for future research.",
