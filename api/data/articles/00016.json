                "text": "Tax-benefit models provide tools for policy analyses that should enable researchers to focus their attention on formulating policy scenarios and analysing their effects. From the users\u2019 and the developers\u2019 points of view, numerous characteristics and features are desirable to maximise the model\u2019s usefulness. A model framework that offers generalised components essential for tax-benefit modelling while at the same time providing a large degree of flexibility in defining the specific parameters can be re-used for a multitude of modelling purposes. This paper discusses issues arising in the construction of such a general framework and illustrates possible approaches by reference to the the framework developed for construction of the EUROMOD tax-benefit model. EUROMOD is an integrated tax-benefit microsimulation model covering 15 (pre 2004) countries that are members of the European Union (<a href=\"#bib16\">Immervoll <i>et al</i>., 1999</a>) as well as 4 of the New Member States. Implementing this many tax-benefit systems in one single consistent framework requires a robust yet flexible structure. The framework needs to reflect the basic structural characteristics of tax-benefit systems while leaving enough room for a diversity of particular instruments and rules. This paper outlines the general model framework adopted. We argue that, apart from its direct usefulness for EUROMOD, the framework has far wider applicability as a general approach to static tax-benefit microsimulation modelling.",

It follows that the design of tax-benefit models should be <i>flexible</i>, enabling users to specify a wide range of different policy scenarios and make it easy to switch between scenarios. <a href=\"#bib11\">Hancock (1997)</a> argues in a first analysis of the computing requirements for EUROMOD that flexibility is probably the most important corner stone of the computing strategy.",

As highlighted in the previous section, simply lining up national models next to each other is not suitable as the design of national models will tend to reflect national priorities. Such conceptual differences will make it hard or impossible to compare the results of different models and prevent a consistent specification of policy reforms. A generalised modelling framework should therefore allow <i>consistency</i> in the specification of different systems.

The <i>policy spine</i> is a list of policies indicating the sequence by which they are applied in the tax-benefit system. For example, if social insurance contributions are tax deductible, then the entry Social Insurance Contributions would have to appear <i>before</i> Income Tax because the model requires the amount of social insurance contributions as a prerequisite for calculating income tax; similarly, if social assistance benefits depend on after tax income, then the entry Social Assistance Benefits would have to appear <i>after</i> Income Tax since income taxes would be a necessary input for calculating Social Assistance. At the lowest level is the tax-benefit <i>module</i>, which performs the calculation of a certain part of the tax or benefit (e.g., a deduction, or applying a rate schedule to a tax base) on each fiscal unit.

Although more costly to build initially, a <i>generalised</i> model is less costly in the long run if the framework can be re-used for a multitude of purposes. In addition, the robustness and reliability of a modelling framework will be positively related to the number of users and uses. As a result, a generalised modelling platform will \u2018mature\u2019 more quickly than purpose-built model frameworks with a more narrowly defined scope.

Similarly, model maintenance is considerably simplified if all one needs to do to update policy rules is to change the relevant parameters (such as new amounts, rates or definitions).

This improves the robustness of model, so that errors in one part of the code do not influence other parts. Once a module has been thoroughly tested and is found to work, it can be added to the system as a whole.

Equally important, a strictly modular design simplifies the maintenance of a model considerably. It ensures that changes, which inevitably have to be made during the lifetime of any tax-benefit model, do not have unexpected side effects on other modules and enables separate parts of a MSM to be developed independently by different members of a team.

This is the case for any tax-benefit model since it is often necessary to formulate a large number of policy scenarios in order to explore the research question at hand.

Any multi-country micro-output will therefore be of a similar size which may exceed the relevant limits of some commercially available software tools.

We note the high cost of developing microsimulation models in different countries and argue for the need to control these costs. We present a generalised microsimulation framework that, if adopted, provides substantial economies of scale in the design of microsimulation models. Although the time taken to construct this general framework has been considerable, the subsequent economies of scale that result have already become evident as the framework and its components have successfully been used to implement an integrated European tax-benefit model comprising the tax-benefit systems of 19 EU member countries. This implementation has taken three years whereas a separate development of individual country specific MSMs would have taken much longer.<a href=\"#fn9\"><sup>9</sup></a>",

While incorporating behavioural changes can be a worthwhile exercise, its usefulness depends on the questions to be addressed. For example, for the purpose of understanding the interactions between different tax-benefit instruments a model, which does not mix immediate effects with longer-term behavioural dimensions, will often be preferable. Nevertheless, because of the framework, future expansions of the model to incorporate behavioural response are feasible without radical redesign. For example <a href=\"#bib9\">Colombino <i>et al</i>.
