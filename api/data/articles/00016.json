From the users\u2019 and the developers\u2019 points of view, numerous characteristics and features are desirable to maximise the model\u2019s usefulness. A model framework that offers generalised components essential for tax-benefit modelling while at the same time providing a large degree of flexibility in defining the specific parameters can be re-used for a multitude of modelling purposes. This paper discusses issues arising in the construction of such a general framework and illustrates possible approaches by reference to the the framework developed for construction of the EUROMOD tax-benefit model. EUROMOD is an integrated tax-benefit microsimulation model covering 15 (pre 2004) countries that are members of the European Union (<a href=\"#bib16\">Immervoll <i>et al</i>, 1999</a>) as well as 4 of the New Member States. Implementing this many tax-benefit systems in one single consistent framework requires a robust yet flexible structure. The framework needs to reflect the basic structural characteristics of tax-benefit systems while leaving enough room for a diversity of particular instruments and rules. This paper outlines the general model framework adopted. We argue that, apart from its direct usefulness for EUROMOD, the framework has far wider applicability as a general approach to static tax-benefit microsimulation modelling.",

It follows that the design of tax-benefit models should be <i>flexible</i>, enabling users to specify a wide range of different policy scenarios and make it easy to switch between scenarios. <a href=\"#bib11\">Hancock (1997)</a> argues in a first analysis of the computing requirements for EUROMOD that flexibility is probably the most important corner stone of the computing strategy.",

As highlighted in the previous section, simply lining up national models next to each other is not suitable as the design of national models will tend to reflect national priorities. Such conceptual differences will make it hard or impossible to compare the results of different models and prevent a consistent specification of policy reforms. A generalised modelling framework should therefore allow <i>consistency</i> in the specification of different systems.

The <i>policy spine</i> is a list of policies indicating the sequence by which they are applied in the tax-benefit system. For example, if social insurance contributions are tax deductible, then the entry Social Insurance Contributions would have to appear <i>before</i> Income Tax because the model requires the amount of social insurance contributions as a prerequisite for calculating income tax; similarly, if social assistance benefits depend on after tax income, then the entry Social Assistance Benefits would have to appear <i>after</i> Income Tax since income taxes would be a necessary input for calculating Social Assistance. At the lowest level is the tax-benefit <i>module</i>, which performs the calculation of a certain part of the tax or benefit (e.g., a deduction, or applying a rate schedule to a tax base) on each fiscal unit.

Although more costly to build initially, a <i>generalised</i> model is less costly in the long run if the framework can be re-used for a multitude of purposes.

As a result, a generalised modelling platform will \u2018mature\u2019 more quickly than purpose-built model frameworks with a more narrowly defined scope.

Similarly, model maintenance is considerably simplified if all one needs to do to update policy rules is to change the relevant parameters (such as new amounts, rates or definitions).

Once a module has been thoroughly tested and is found to work, it can be added to the system as a whole.

Equally important, a strictly modular design simplifies the maintenance of a model considerably. It ensures that changes, which inevitably have to be made during the lifetime of any tax-benefit model, do not have unexpected side effects on other modules and enables separate parts of a MSM to be developed independently by different members of a team.

For example, in a situation where the tax-benefit rules of country A require information on whether someone is a civil servant and where there is no civil servant variable in country B micro-data, one can specify that the variable \u2018public sector\u2019 available in country B data should be used as a proxy for \u2018civil servant\u2019.",

Because aspects of the population may have changed between data collection and the year of analysis, it may be desirable to adjust the weights in the data to account for these changes. Examples of population changes include the level of unemployment, the number of households with children and the age distribution. It should be noted that extreme care needs to be exercised when doing this. \u2018Correcting\u2019 the data by adjusting weights in relation to many different dimensions can cause anomalies (such as very big weights for certain household types), because re-weighting in relation to any set of characteristics (e.g., the level of unemployment) will invariably distort other dimensions for which the weights have originally been designed for (e.g., non-response, regions).",

Different incomes may increase at different rates and since these rates may themselves differ for different groups (for example employment income may increase at a different rate for males/females, civil servants etc.), we allow for differential uprating. A potential use of the updating mechanism is for short-term forecasting of fiscal variables, where the underlying data is adjusted to match expected changes in the population and incomes.

This is the case for any tax-benefit model since it is often necessary to formulate a large number of policy scenarios in order to explore the research question at hand. For a multi-country model, the number of output files is potentially much larger. In addition, the total sample size of the micro-data underlying a multi-country MSM can be very large. In the case of EUROMOD, these data represent more than 100,000 households containing more than a quarter of a million people. Any multi-country micro-output will therefore be of a similar size which may exceed the relevant limits of some commercially available software tools. Most importantly, analysing micro-output can be very time consuming. Many different analyses are possible and each of them entails a set of assumptions and definition which needs to be decided upon. As a result, it is convenient to have a \u2018standard output\u2019 which can reliably perform most of the desired analyses while keeping all the related choices and assumptions as transparent and accessible to the user as possible.

We note the high cost of developing microsimulation models in different countries and argue for the need to control these costs. We present a generalised microsimulation framework that, if adopted, provides substantial economies of scale in the design of microsimulation models. Although the time taken to construct this general framework has been considerable, the subsequent economies of scale that result have already become evident as the framework and its components have successfully been used to implement an integrated European tax-benefit model comprising the tax-benefit systems of 19 EU member countries. This implementation has taken three years whereas a separate development of individual country specific MSMs would have taken much longer.<a href=\"#fn9\"><sup>9</sup></a>",

While incorporating behavioural changes can be a worthwhile exercise, its usefulness depends on the questions to be addressed. For example, for the purpose of understanding the interactions between different tax-benefit instruments a model, which does not mix immediate effects with longer-term behavioural dimensions, will often be preferable. Nevertheless, because of the framework, future expansions of the model to incorporate behavioural response are feasible without radical redesign. For example <a href=\"#bib9\">Colombino <i>et al</i>.
