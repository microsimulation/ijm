It simulates individual and household tax liabilities and benefit entitlements according to the policy rules in place in each member state. Its main distinguishing feature is that it covers all European countries within the same framework allowing for flexibility of the analysis and comparability of the results. Generally, EUROMOD is much more flexible than a national microsimulation model and this flexibility is essential if consistency (of results across countries), transferability (of tax-benefit system components) and use by multiple users are to be achieved. The potential trade-offs between flexibility and user friendliness are dealt with through the adoption of a user interface specifically designed for a multi-country microsimulation model.",

The major drawbacks are common to other survey data. In particular, the coverage of financial income is generally low with an impact on the simulation of taxes on capital income. Moreover, the lack of information about assets and the aggregation of income variables at annual level do not help in defining precisely the means-tests used in the simulation of social assistance programmes. In addition, the Eurostat version of the SILC provides information on income components in harmonised form. This involves the aggregation of benefits according to function (e.g. unemployment, old age). In preparing the input database for EUROMOD the information on the individual benefit payments must be recovered using imputation of some kind. This process inevitably reduces the precision of estimates using these data (<a href=\"#bib36\">Figari <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>).",

We acknowledge the contribution of all past and current members of the EUROMOD consortium and in particular of our colleagues at ISER at the University of Essex without whom the achievement of EUROMOD for the whole EU-27 would not have been possible. The EUROMOD preparatory study was funded by the European Commission\u2019s Targeted Socio-Economic Research (TSER 1996\u20131997). EUROMOD itself was constructed for the then EU-15 countries funded by the European Commission Fourth Framework Programme (FP4 \u2013 EUROMOD: an integrated European benefit-tax model 1998\u20132000 CT97\u20133060). It was then updated as part of the FP5 project MICRESA (Micro analysis of the European Social Agenda 2001\u20132004 HPSE-CT2001-00099). The FP6 project I-CUE (Improving the Capacity and Usability of EUROMOD 2005\u20132008 RIDS 011859) provided the basis to extend the model to the whole EU-27 countries and make it easier to update, maintain and use. The FP6 project AIM-AP (Accurate Income Measurement for the Assessment of Public Policies 2006\u20132009 No. 028412) has explored ways to improve EUROMOD capacity to include non-cash incomes, indirect taxes and modelling benefit non-take up and tax evasion. More recently, the EUROMODupdate projects, supported by the European Union Programme for Employment and Social Security \u2013 PROGRESS (2007\u20132013), have sustained the EUROMOD enlargement to cover 27 Member States, updating to recent policy systems and using data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) as the input database.",
