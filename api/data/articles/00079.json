The model can be used for ex post and ex ante evaluation of reforms of personal income taxation and social benefits in Russia. In addition, being compatible with EUROMOD, the Russian model is suitable for simulation of cross-country policy transfers. The aim of this paper is to shed light on various aspects of the model. It discusses specific problems arising in the evaluation of unreported income and benefits non-take up in Russia. The final estimates of poverty and inequality from RUSMOD are very close to those based on National accounts; hence, the model can be seen as a reliable tool for evaluating the current performance of the Russian tax-benefit system and the distributive impact of potential tax-benefit reforms. Then the paper provides an example of application of the model \u2013 an analysis of alternative scenarios for improving the design of child allowances in Russia. Currently, this benefit has a poor targeting performance and varies across regions of Russia in terms of design and generosity, which raises serious equity concerns. Redirecting these resources to the poor \u2013 by means of better targeting and raising the benefit amounts \u2013 brings about significant improvements in overall and child poverty indicators even at the current level of spending. The most sizable impact on poverty is achieved by implementing the unified national design of the program.",

Moreover, after the decentralization reform carried out in 2005 the budgetary spending on social protection is mainly administered at the regional level. This motivated the regions to implement their own social programs that differ in terms of design and generosity. However, little is known about the impact of the tax-benefit policies on income distribution and poverty in Russia. Due to the overall complexity of the system the available studies focus on impact assessment of separate instruments, such as child and maternity benefits (<a href=\"#bib6\">Denisova <i>et al</i>. 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ovcharova and Popova 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ovcharova <i>et al</i>. 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Notten &amp; Gassmann 2008</a>), in kind social benefits (<a href=\"#bib36\">Volchkova <i>et al</i>. 2006</a>) or indirect taxes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Decoster 2003</a>).",

Yet, Russia is highly heterogeneous with substantial regional differences in social protection spending and outcomes. Due to different budget constraints of regions, the decentralization of social assistance has resulted in an increase in the inter-regional inequality in payments to poor households. Our simulations show that it is possible to achieve better distributional outcomes even at the same level of spending, just by means of changing the program design.",

In the early 1990s Russia has encountered a whole complex of social problems associated both with the longterm action of demographic factors (depopulation) and with the new challenges of radical institutional and economic transformation resulting in the growth in unemployment, poverty and inequality. All sectors of social protection have undergone severe cuts in spending and major reforms, such as the reform of the pension system, introduction of the means-tested social assistance, monetization of the <i>privileges.</i><sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> In a relatively short period of time Russia has moved from a centrally managed universalistic to a residual neo-liberal welfare system (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cook 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Titterton 2006</a>). Since mid-2000s the Russian welfare state has been expanding due to high commodity prices, however, the dependency on oil revenues makes the future of the system highly volatile (<a href=\"#bib2\">Cerami 2009</a>).",

The present Russian federal system comprises a complex structure of social responsibilities divided between the federal and regional governments. Pensions and social insurance-based allowances are regulated at the federal level and financed from the employer social insurance contributions (SIC) and the Federal Budget. As a result of the decentralization reform carried out in 2005 the majority of responsibilities for legislative regulation and financing of non-contributory social benefits and services were transferred from the federal to the regional level (to be matched with respective intra-budgetary transfers). The delivery of all non-contributory programs is carried out at the municipal level. However, few municipalities provide their own local social assistance benefits out of their budgets. The tax system is largely a unified, national system. There are a few taxes set by regional and local governments but their share in overall taxation is small. Approximately one-third of the Federal Budget expenditure is allocated to intergovernmental fiscal transfers. The system of budget allocations is very complicated and results in high administrative costs. The lack of transparency leaves the system open for the regions\u2019 lobbying for better \u2018treatment\u2019 from the federal authorities (<a href=\"#bib12\">IBRD/WB 2011</a>).",

Yet this achievement can be mainly attributed to the favorable economic background which stimulated the growth in minimum and average earnings and maintained high levels of employment. The overall redistributive impact of the Russian social protection system is low. While the economy grew annually by 5% on average, Gini coefficient of income inequality has increased from 0.395 to 0.420 between 2000 and 2010. Bottom 40% of the Russian population was still unable to recover their pre-1990 reform income level by 2010. Throughout the 2000s the main efforts of the government were aimed at compensating the decline in earnings of public sector employees and state pensions.

Thus, the decentralization reform has boosted inter-regional inequality in access of the population to social assistance and aggravated inter-regional inequality in living standards.

This refers to all indirect taxes and in-kind benefits (free or subsidized health care, childcare and other social services). Theoretically these elements can be accounted for within the model framework, as was demonstrated by a EUROMOD related project.<sup><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup> However, they have been neglected, at least temporarily, to limit complexity and to keep model building a manageable task.

Thirdly, due to lack of the relevant data in the survey a number of allowances could not be simulated.

The most common eligibility rule is that the total household income should be below the (fraction) of the regional poverty line (MSL) due to circumstances that could not be prevented by the family. In other words, it means that all people of working age should provide a justification if they are currently not working and not seeking employment. The target group may be additionally narrowed down to certain categories of the population that are considered to be the most vulnerable in that particular region (e.g. lone mothers, pensioners living along, families with the disabled members). The size of allowance is usually computed as a (fraction) of the shortfall of the household income from the poverty line for that particular household.

The size of allowance is equal to: (social standard of living space*N of persons in the household * social standard of the cost of rent and utilities per 1 square metre) \u2013 (household income * maximum share of the cost of rent and utilities in total household income). For non-poor households, i.e. those whose income is equal or over the regional MSL, and for households eligible for discounts on rent and utilities, the formula is additionally multiplied by adjustment coefficients to reduce the subsidy size. The latter cannot exceed the actual cost of rent and utilities. The subsidy is only available if the household has no debts for rent and utilities. Social standards of the cost of rent and utilities are set by regional authorities. The maximum share of the cost of rent and utilities in household income may not exceed 22%.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"

Until recently, the RLMS was the only freely available dataset and the main source of all empirical research on poverty in Russia. It is a typical multi-topic survey with an extended set of information on economic well-being and health status. It collects individual level information on demographic characteristics, within-family relationships, labour market status, primary income by source, social benefits (including those that cannot be simulated), and also expenditure and other relevant characteristics that may affect tax liabilities or benefit entitlements. Since December 1994 data are collected once a year by the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Initially the survey was managed by the University of North Carolina and satisfies international standards in terms of sampling and quality of data collection.

For the majority of Russian firms both in public and private sector, over a third of total earnings is variable and not fixed in labour contracts (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gimpelson &amp; Kapeliushnikov 2011</a>). This part comprises premiums and bonuses that can fluctuate contingent upon general economic conditions and firm performance. In case of economic slowdown, the variable part of earnings shrinks, while in the upturn the employees are likely to enjoy an additional premium. In addition, Russian firms might use informal (undeclared) payments in order to cut costs related to SIC. This part of earnings is not bound by any formal constraints and is even more sensitive to changes in economic conditions. According to the national statistics agency, throughout the 2000s the share of earnings hidden from statistical observation, i.e. unreported earnings, made up about 30-40% of the official (declared) earnings<sup><a href=\"#fn7\">7</a></sup>, ranging from less than 15% in the bottom income decile to over 50% in the top income decile (<a href=\"#bib32\">UNDP 2011</a>). These unreported earnings are imputed and included as an element of total population income in macro-statistics. Noteworthy, this is something else than the hidden or the illegal economies. The latter comprise the activities related to tax fraud or tax evasion or illegal activities. The non-observed economy also comprises activities that have nothing to do with criminality or tax evasion, but that still remain unobserved because the traditional survey tools are not perfect (non-response, under-reporting, short income reference period) and business registers are not always complete and up-to-date.",

For self-employed people the share of those who reported that they were working without registration was 17.2%. Over 80% of those who had occasional jobs worked without a formal contract.

As mentioned in <a href=\"#s3\">Section 3</a>, the source of original data for assessing income distribution is HBS. Since 1997 HBS collects data on consumption only. The preference to use consumption as welfare indicator is dictated by country-specific considerations. As in other transition economies, in Russia consumption data is collected more reliably than income data (<a href=\"#bib4\">Deaton 1997</a>). The latter tends to suffer from incomplete measurement, under-reporting, and seasonality. Some regular (non-seasonal) sources of income, such as earnings of formal sector workers and social transfers, are quite accurately measured by surveys. More volatile sources, such as the variable and/or informal part of earnings, income from subsistence farming or some types of self-employment, are poorly captured by surveys (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ovcharova &amp; Tesliuk 2006</a>). This is true for HBS and it also true for other household surveys. Noteworthy, another study using RLMS-HSE for 1994-2006 have concluded that estimates of household welfare based on expenditure are more reliable: they are consistently higher and less volatile than those based on income (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gorodnichenko <i>et al</i>. 2010</a>).",

One of the parameters of this model \u2013 a root mean square deviation of logarithms \u2013 is derived from HBS, another parameter \u2013 mean per capita income \u2013 is taken from National accounts. Due to the adjustment for unreported earnings the mean income in National accounts is considerably higher than the expenditure aggregate in HBS. As a result, poverty and inequality estimates in the macro-statistics are lower than those derived from the original HBS data, although the mean income is higher. The appropriateness of using the lognormality assumption for modeling the distribution of income in the present situation of Russia is a most debatable issue. At the same time, comparing RUSMOD output with the official statistics is the only way to check the validity of the model in terms of income distribution estimates.",

To arrive at this estimate all the components of income reported in the survey, including employment income of formal sector workers, pensions, social benefits, private transfers, investment income and lump-sum income were summed up. This sum was then deducted from the household consumption aggregate.<sup><a href=\"#fn10\">10</a></sup> If the result of this function was higher than zero it was treated as the unreported income. For 17% of Russian households the reported expenditure appeared to exceed the reported income. The share of those with under-reported income ranged from 15% in the bottom income decile to 25% in the top decile. On average the imputed amount was equal to 20% of the total household income (from 19% in the bottom income decile to 30% in the top decile). Although this method is more straightforward, the scale of income adjustment is similar to that made by the national statistics agency. The inclusion of unreported income in the simulated disposable income solved the problem of the inflated poverty rate. The poverty headcount which was equal to 23.4% before income imputation dropped to 12.9% after income imputation, which is similar to the official figure (12.6%).",

Given that the information on assets reported in the survey is limited compared to that available to local Social protection offices and given the positive correlation between household assets and unreported income, the inclusion of the latter enables us to simulate the means test more precisely. However, even after the income adjustment the share of households eligible for means-tested allowances remained inflated, which resulted in underestimation of the poverty headcount after the simulations (11.8% versus 12.6% according to macro-statistics). The numbers of recipients were higher than those reported in administrative statistics by 30% for the child allowance and by around 50% for the state social assistance and the housing subsidy. Unfortunately, the administrative statistics does not collect any information about non-take up rates<sup><a href=\"#fn12\">12</a></sup> of means-tested benefits and this topic has not been researched so far. Thus, the only option was to rely on theoretical considerations and evidence from other countries. For a few OECD countries for which estimates are available, they range between 20 and 60% in case of social assistance and housing programs and 20 to 40% in case of insurance-based unemployment benefits (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hernanz <i>et al</i>. 2004</a>), which is similar to the situation observed in Russia.",

The former arise when for some reasons eligible households choose not to apply for benefits. The \u2018voluntary\u2019 non-take up may happen due to lack of knowledge about the available social programs and high costs associated with the claim, e.g. complicated administrative procedures or social stigma (<a href=\"#bib17\">Moffitt 1983</a>). It is more likely to happen when the benefit amounts are low compared to the costs of applying, which is true for all means-tested allowances in Russia. A typical example of a supply side problem is when due to lack of funds the welfare administration is compelled to ration the benefits. The Russian program of state social assistance makes a good illustration. Since it is fully regulated and funded by regions, the number of those who receive the cash benefit is limited by financial constraints of the Regional Budgets. In many regions applications are accepted up to a budget limit and local authorities have discretion to refuse applications.<sup><a href=\"#fn13\">13</a></sup>",

Thus, the eligibility can only be determined through imputation procedures based on household characteristics and income and those are not always as detailed as it is necessary, while administrative rules governing eligibility are quite complex. For example, the means test for the <i>state social assistance</i> and <i>housing subsidies</i> has to be applied to household income averaged over the last 3 or 6 months, respectively, yet the survey collects information only about income for the month preceding the survey, and the simulations assume that this amount of income is received by the household throughout the year. This is a quite strong assumption for Russia, where the large part of earnings is variable. There is another imprecision in simulation of housing subsidies. In order to be eligible each household member has to provide a proof of registration at this particular address. Unfortunately, information about the registration status of household members was not collected, so the simulations assume that that all household members residing in the dwelling are eligible which might not be true in reality.",

In most regions it is households with children who constitute the majority of the poor. Several studies show that families with children have the higher probability of being poor and the higher poverty gap compared to other groups of households (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ovcharova &amp; Popova 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ovcharova <i>et al</i>. 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">UNICEF 2011</a>).

Secondly, we limit the number of beneficiaries by those children whose total household income from all sources is below the poverty line (option 2). Thirdly, we reduce the number of eligible children to those whose total household income is below 75% of the poverty line (option 3).

The second important conclusion is that holding the current budget constant, with stricter income test (options 2 and 3) poverty indicators could be lower than they are at present. The largest reduction in the overall poverty headcount (by 8%) and the child poverty headcount (by 12%) is observed if the amounts are flat and the allowance is paid only to those whose household income is below the poverty line (reform 2.2). However, poverty gap indices are less sensitive to this reform: there is just a 3% reduction in the overall poverty gap and a 4% reduction in the child poverty gap. The stricter income test (reform 2.3) brings about a greater reduction in the poverty gap for the whole population (14.5%) and children (by almost 25%), but it comes at the price of almost no change in the national and child poverty headcounts.",

In terms of the child poverty headcount reform 3.2 is almost as effective as reform 2.2 (an 11% reduction), and it is twice as effective in terms of the child poverty gap (a 10% reduction). Finally, none of the reforms is as beneficial for households with 3+ children as reform 3.2: the poverty headcount of this group is reduced by 33.5% and their poverty gap \u2013 by 20%.

The introduction of the national benefit amounts adjusted for regional PPPs and narrowing the eligibility to those with household income below poverty line (reform 3.2) appears to be most beneficial in terms of the majority of our poverty measures. Under this reform the national poverty headcount and poverty gap measures fall by 15 and 6.5%, respectively; the child poverty headcount and child poverty gap measures fall by 25 and 12%; and families with 3+ children enjoy a 50% reduction in their poverty headcount and a 39% reduction in their poverty gap.",

It appears to be both politically feasible (before 2005 the program was the federal mandate) and socially just. Currently, the disparity in amounts of child allowances across regions undermines the principles of social justice. In this respect the best available option is to set benefit amounts at the national level, adjusting for regional differences in price levels. To achieve the best results in terms of poverty reduction the unification of standards across regions should be reinforced by bringing the eligibility conditions for child allowances in line with other means-tested programs, i.e. by reducing the number of beneficiaries to those with household income below the poverty line. Even more substantial improvements in all poverty indicators could be achieved by redirecting the resources from the non-poor recipients of housing subsidies to poor households with children.",

The other consideration that should not be ignored is a tradeoff between the degree of low-income targeting and the size of redistributive budgets. Targeting and budgets are not independent: the budget tend to decrease while targeting increases, as the average voter is less inclined to support the programs from which they do not have any benefit (<a href=\"#bib25\">Pritchett 2005</a>).",

The model brings about opportunities of ex ante and ex post assessment of various reforms aimed at improving the Russian tax-benefit system which has a low redistributive effect. Arguably the capacities for poverty reduction in Russia have been exhausted. It is unlikely that a large-scale poverty reduction could be achieved without the reforms that would combine a significant increase in spending on anti-poverty programs with structural changes to provide a more equal access to social programs for households living in different regions of the country.",

Russia allocates little to anti-poverty programs, and even less resources is reaching the poor because of a low targeting accuracy. Non-poor households constitute more than a half of the beneficiaries of means-tested programs. Such a high rate of leakage is determined by differences in the eligibility rules of the programs, lack of reliable income control procedures and wide occurrence of informal income. The re-allocation of these resources in favour of the poor could bring about significant improvements in the overall and child poverty indicators, as demonstrated by our simulations. This can be achieved by: (1) redistributing resources of each program, within the existing budget, in favor of the poorest households; (2) changing the direction of the budgetary expenditure allocated for social safety nets from programs designed to provide social security to middle income groups, such as <i>housing subsidies</i>, to programs where the main target group are the poor (<i>child allowances</i>). Both measures are not mutually exclusive.",

Few regions introduced improvements in the way means-tested programs are designed. However, these are not adopted by other regions because there is no authority ensuring that \u2018best practices\u2019 are transferred across the regions. Arguably, the federal authorities are best placed to initiate and implement this kind of reform. The simulations show that, holding the current budget constant, by far the greatest reduction in all poverty indicators is achieved if the benefit amounts are set at the national level and adjusted for regional differences in price levels. Hence, there is a strong case for returning the program of <i>child allowances</i> back under the control of federal authorities or developing a strong redistribution mechanism at the federal level to help the poorest regions provide an adequate level of cash support for their poor.",

For example, one major aspect is investigating the distributional implications of non-cash household income arising from provision of in-kind benefits and public services in Russia. In addition, being compatible with EUROMOD \u2013 the Russian model can be used for cross-country policy learning. It means that family benefits of a \u2018donor\u2019 country may be integrated into the Russian tax-benefit system and vice versa. Finally, the output of the model can be incorporated into a dynamic model framework in order to study the effects of policy reforms in a longer time perspective, e.g. effects on labour supply or demographic behaviour of households. This is left for future research.",
