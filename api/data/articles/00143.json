The authors use different maps as input for the generation of the geometrical representation of the city. Our aim is to expand these methods by creating appropriate data regarding the building stock and the population living and working on this building stock that can be used as input to these models for the generation of synthetic cities. <a href=\"#bib17\">Kang, Ma, Tong, and Liu (2012)</a> create a set of synthetic cities in order to asses the relationship between urban morphologies and human mobility. <a href=\"#bib18\">Kii, Akimoto, and Doi (2014)</a> develop a simple synthetic city for the assessment of urban transport policies, the authors generate the synthetic city and use this data as input for a land use model, subsequently the authors apply the postulated policies to the model in order to asses them. The authors argue in favor of including user behaviour in urban models. <a href=\"#bib11\">Farber, Neutens, Miller, and Li (2013)</a> generate eighty different synthetic cities in order to analyze the Social Interaction Potential of these environments based on commuting patterns and land use distribution. <a href=\"#bib1\">Bagchi, Sprintson, and Singh (2013)</a> use a synthetic city for the simulation of fire dispersion on an electrical distribution grid, in this case the authors represent the building stock and an electrical grid. <a href=\"#bib23\">Mei <i>et al</i>. (2015)</a> develop a synthetic city in order to study the diffusion of infectious diseases. The authors use the synthetic city in order to understand the outbreak of influenza in dense populated urban areas in China. In this case the authors do not require a detailed description of the building stock geometry but only the building use. <a href=\"#bib39\">St\u00f6tzer, Hauer, Richter, and Styczynski (2015)</a> define a simple synthetic city for the estimation of the potential load shift of commercial and residential electricity demand. Because the authors are only interested in electric consumption, they do not create a geometrical representation of the building stock nor do they have any type of geo-reference in the synthetic city. In this paper the authors define the electric consumption as a function of household size. Many of the examples presented above could be implemented on a more realistic environment describing the characteristics of the building stock and the population living on them.",

(1977)</a> is a commonly used method among social scientist used to simulate a large range of social phenomena at a micro-level. The first step of this method is normally the generation of a synthetic population representing the population under analysis. The spatial microsimulation methodology extends this concept by allocating estimated synthetic populations to geographical areas (<a href=\"#bib7\">Clarke &amp; Holm, 1987</a>). This simulation method is applied by a large number of disciplines. <a href=\"#bib4\">Brown and Harding (2002)</a> and <a href=\"#bib38\">Smith, Pearce, and Harland (2011)</a> argue the use of this type of models for the analysis of health systems, the modeling of resources consumption is addressed by <a href=\"#bib44\">Williamson, Clarke, and McDonald (1996)</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Williamson, Mitchell, and McDonald (2002)</a> for the estimation of water consumption and <a href=\"#bib6\">Chingcuanco and Miller (2012)</a> and <a href=\"#bib25\">Mu\u00f1oz H. and Peters (2014)</a> for the estimation of energy demand.

In this paper we make use of an \u201cgeneralised regression weighting\u201d (GREGWT) algorithm to create a synthetic population. We use the available R library (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mu\u00f1oz H., Vidyattama, &amp; Tanton, 2015a</a>), implementing the GREGWT algorithm, originally developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bell, 2000</a>).

The GREGWT method is classified as a deterministic reweight method (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tanton, Williamson, &amp; Harding, 2014</a>). Deterministic reweighting methods aim to reweight a survey to match known aggregated values of geographical areas. The sample size and availability of the data of these geographical areas vary between countries. For the European Union a standard incorporating the different national definitions exist. This is the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup>) standard. This nomenclature describes four hierarchies: (0) national territories; (1) NUTS\u20131; (2) NUTS\u20132; and NUTS\u20133. A reweighting of a national survey could be implemented at any of the NUTS levels. Depending on the research question a suitable geographical area should be selected. These geographical areas have different names on each country and the authors referee them according to the use case location. These areas are known as: (a) Summary Files in the U.S.; (b) Profile Tables or Basic Summary Tabulations (BSTs) in Canada; (c) and Small Area Statistics in the U.K. (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pritchard &amp; Miller, 2012</a>).",

We classify each individual to one of the 36 IWU building typology types. For the estimation of heating demand per dwelling unit we need to take into account the household size and divide the estimated heating demand by its household size. For a household with four members we compute the heating demand for each member of the family as <i>kWh</i> per dwelling unit <i>m</i><sup>2</sup>. In order to get the heating demand of the dwelling unit we sum the heating demand of each member divided by household size. On this model the computed heating demand of each family member is the same, nonetheless if we where to take user behaviour into account this values would differ from each other (<a href=\"#bib24\">Mu\u00f1oz H., 2014</a>).

The used R implementation of GREGWT algorithm is able to perform an integrated reweight. This is important for maintaining unit aggregations, f.ex. to maintain the family structure given by the survey. Nonetheless, this does not allow us to benchmark to different aggregation units. Attempts to address this issue exist in the literature, <a href=\"#bib13\">Guo and Bhat (2007)</a> benchmark an initial survey to household characteristics and fit the result to individual benchmarks in the integerization<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> of the weights via a Monte Carlo process. This method allows to \u201cbenchmark\u201d to both aggregation units. The disadvantage of this approach relies on its inegerization process, this process is only required for the construction of agents at the cost of a decline of the algorithm performance. For the presented simulation we do not require individual agents and therefore any form of integerization would be contra productive for the final result. For a description of other similar approaches see <a href=\"#bib32\">Pritchard and Miller (2012)</a> and Ma and Srinivasan (2015). <a href=\"#bib32\">Pritchard and Miller (2012)</a> propose a \u201cConditional Monte Carlo Synthesis Procedure\u201d to fit the synthetic population to both: household and individual benchmarks. Again this procedure assumes an integerization of the survey. As described above we aim to develop a method that does not require an integerization step in order to avoid: (a) a decline in the performance of the algorithm, (b) an explosion of computational time, and (c) introduction of a stochastic element to a deterministic approach. <a href=\"#bib22\">Ma and Srinivasan (2015)</a> developed another method to create a synthetic population: \u201cfitness-based synthesis\u201d (FBS).

For variables benchmarked to dwelling units we divide them by household size, an individual with household size 3 will get a 1/3 instead of 1 in the <i>X</i> input matrix. For all variables counting buildings we divide the values by the household size and number of dwelling units, the same individual living in a building with 6 dwelling units will have a value of 1/3/6. This calibration is formalized in Equation 6 and 7, where <i>HH</i> is household size and <i>DU</i> is number of dwelling units.",

A possible implementation of this method is to align the initial weight distribution to proposed policies implemented at a federal level. In this scenario the aggregated retrofit rates are defined at a federal level and the allocation of these retrofits could be simulated as function of demographic characteristics at a lower geographical level.",

We may achieve this by obtaining aggregated benchmarks at a finer spatial resolution, this may not be possible due to data protection concerns. For this reason we want to develop new methods to further disaggregate heating consumption values. For this disaggregation we see two possible paths, the first step for both paths is the grouping of individual data into buildings.",

The advantage of this method is that satellite images are available for the entire world, making the transferability of the method higher.",

Available aggregated data regarding demographic information as well as information on the building stock are available at this level from the last German census (2011). In order estimate heat demand at a micro level we classify each individual in the micro census to a building type. We make use of a well established building typology for this classification (<a href=\"#bib21\">Loga <i>et al</i>., 2011</a>). Because we know the dwelling unit size of every individual in the micro census we are able to transform the specific heat demand provided by the building typology into an absolute value, we control this value by household size, dividing the absolute estimate heat demand by the household size of each individual.",
