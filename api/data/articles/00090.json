As indicated in column 2 of the table, four chapters go a step further and add a behavioural component to the model. One such extension is to include labour supply in the model, as is done in Chapter 3. A discrete choice model of labour supply is estimated for all potential workers. The estimates are subsequently used to evaluate the simulation of the \u201cethical income\u201d proposal in Chile, which consists of a lump sum social transfer and a work subsidy. Interestingly, the authors find that poverty and income inequality are reduced but that the overall number of hours worked will decline as workers leave the labour market due to the social transfer which exerts a negative income effect. The authors do not quantify the budgetary impact of the reform proposal but this could easily be integrated within this model.",

Given that in Latin-American countries, indirect taxes constitute the main source of tax revenue, it seems justified to make a special effort to model consumer demand. As expenditure surveys are often carried out separately from income surveys, expenditure information has to be imputed in the household income surveys. This is a considerable challenge that led the authors to use specific imputation procedures. In contrast to Chapter 1 that supposes restrictive linear Engel curves, Chapter 6 and 8 estimate a quasi almost ideal demand system (QAIDS) that allows for quadratic Engel curves. From a methodological point of view it would have been informative to document the predictive validity of the estimated model.",

The former are, in contrast to the latter, paying social contributions and taxes and accumulate entitlements to social benefits. A large degree of informal work in the labour market diminishes the impact that a direct income tax or a social transfer reform may have. On the other hand, even small VAT reforms appear to generate relatively strong effects on tax collection and income distribution, suggesting that a VAT reform would affect consumption of both formal and informal workers. We would warmly welcome future work providing a decomposition analysis that shows whether gainers or losers are concentrated among (in)formal workers.",

Despite possible improvements, the book will constitute indispensable reading for those researchers planning to invest in microsimulation applied to Latin American countries. The same holds for policymakers concerned with the fiscal and social consequences of policy reforms. Finally, the book provides user-friendly illustrations of the potential of the microsimulation approach. We are looking forward to the sequel to this project.",
