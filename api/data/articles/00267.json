                "text": "Like other African countries, Senegal has been hit by Covid-19 and has implemented measures to contain the epidemic. These measures impact men and women differently, mainly via the impacts on the labour market. We simulate the economic shocks in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to assess the economic impacts. We capture the gendered impact on women\u2019s employment by linking the CGE model with a micro-simulation employment module. Furthermore, we assess the impact on poverty and inequality by executing a distributive analysis with a sequential top-down layered micro-simulation households module. The results show that the Senegalese economy suffers from Covid-19 measures with a decrease in gross domestic product by 5% and 7% in the moderate and severe scenarios, respectively. While most sectors are negatively affected, some benefit from the increase in foreign demand (e.g., for certain agricultural products). In terms of employment, unskilled workers are the most affected group. Female workers are relatively less affected than male workers due to the predominant presence of women in the agricultural sectors. Indeed, the increased foreign demand for agricultural products positively affects the agricultural sectors. However, poverty increases at the national level for all households, especially for rural households and households living in urban areas except Dakar. Specifically, the poverty gap and severity for rural households increase more than for urban households.",

Women are particularly affected by crises. Indeed, the impacts of crises are never gender-neutral, and Covid-19 is no exception. Women tend to earn less than men and work in less skilled jobs. Furthermore, they are burdened with unpaid care and domestic work, which forces them to withdraw from the labour market (<a href=\"#bib9\">Azcona et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">OECD, 2020a</a>).",

To capture the different impacts of Covid-19 (national and international), a CGE model was used, along with a microsimulation module, to obtain a more detailed picture of the impact on employment and poverty. The Senegalese economy suffered from the measures taken to contain the Covid-19 epidemic, with a 5% decrease in GDP under the moderate scenario. While most sectors of the economy are affected, those with increasing external demand (e.g., agriculture) have fared better. In terms of employment, unskilled workers are the most impacted group. Women, although strongly impacted, tend to be less affected than their male counterparts. This is due to the predominant presence of women in the agricultural sectors, which are positively impacted by the increase in international demand for agricultural products. In terms of poverty, the pandemic has halved the progress made between 2011 and 2018. The increase in poverty incidence is exceptionally high in rural and urban households outside Dakar. Here, the drop in remittances increases the vulnerability of these households.",

Given the very harmful impact of the epidemic on some sectors, the government should give special consideration to the workers in these sectors.
