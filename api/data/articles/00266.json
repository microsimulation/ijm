With varying degrees in terms of the size and nature of packages, countries have put in place measures to mitigate some of the likely devastating impacts of the pandemic.

In particular, the five contributions included in this issue developed country-level tools to simulate, on an ongoing basis, the economy-wide and household impacts of the crisis as well as existing and alternative policy responses, to identify the most effective interventions. Especially in developing countries, reliable and nationally representative data are longer to collect and may not be timely. Therefore, the availability of rigorous simulation tools can help policy-makers to respond effectively to sudden economic crises, such as that generated by COVID-19 confinement measures, even when data are not readily available. The COVID-19 crisis challenges governments through the widespread nature of its impacts and the uncertainty concerning their magnitude and duration. By analyzing the likely impacts of various policy responses, simulation models provide policy-makers with valuable evidence to comprehend and respond to these challenges effectively. These simulations could be regularly updated as new data have become available and the country has progressed through the different stages of the crisis: epidemic and lockdown, gradual re-opening and full recovery.",

First is the importance of identifying the sectors (industries, firms) and households/individuals that were likely to be hardest hit by the various economic and social disruptions, and estimating the nature and magnitude of their losses. These impact pathways are complex and heterogeneous across the population. With population confinement measures and the total or partial cessation of many, formal and informal, economic sectors, many workers and family enterprises have lost their sources of income. Furthermore, remittances were significantly disrupted as the pandemic has heavily impacted host countries (Europe, North America and Persian Gulf countries) of migrants sending these remittances. Finally, as a result of the decline in domestic and global production, and the disturbance of global value-added chains, production costs and consumer prices have risen while the global petroleum price was falling.",

For example, while social safety nets enable access to cash that speeds up recovery, liquidity alone is not enough when supply chains get severely disrupted. Measures beyond cash transfers, including in-kind transfers, education, health support etc., particularly for vulnerable groups such as women and children, become extremely important. This type of analysis is relevant to the \u2018leave no one behind\u2019 agenda under the SDGs. Furthermore, support to businesses, particularly micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) - e.g. direct support to firms, tax reductions/postponement, wage subsidies - are imperative and need to include informal sectors and the self-employed, which constitute a significant, often predominant, part of most developing economies.",

Furthermore, some sectors might gain importance (e.g.: the digital space, including e-commerce, and the health sector where increased development expenditure is now directed). Simulations can determine how 1) different sectors could contribute to growth and jobs during and after the COVID-19 crisis, and 2) how restructuring the economies could be facilitated by changes in policy (e.g. changes to foreign exchange rules allowing a liberal flow of receipts and payments). Hence, the key importance of macro and micro simulation tools.",

One study (Morocco) uses an input-output model jointly with a microsimulation model. The input-output model contributed to capturing distribution across sectors for observed direct price effects of COVID-19. In these four articles, the effects of the crisis are distinguished by gender and other socio, demographic and economic characteristics. In general, the key channels of impact are through income and consumer price variations which, in the absence of significant savings or credit access, impact household expenditure. In the COVID-19 crisis context, key shocks come from job loss or wage/profit reductions (due to lockdown, recession and border closures), declines in international remittances, and higher consumer prices. One study (from Senegal) uses computable general equilibrium (CGE) model in combination with a microsimulation model to account for the interdependency between industries, factors of production, government, households, and the rest of the world. In addition, GE analysis allows for a broader analysis to examine the impacts of the crisis and policy responses on economic sectors, factor markets, government finances, international trade and a variety of other economic dimensions. Specifically, the CGE-microsimulation analysis can capture: (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abdelkhalek et al., 2022</a>) unprecedented temporary closures of major sectors and reduction in the international mobility of people, goods, and services, leading to a breakdown in international production chains; (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bandiera et al., 2020</a>) the economic interdependence between the sectors deemed to be essential and the sectors that have been \"shut down\" in the short term; (<a href=\"#bib3\">Canelas and Robalino, 2022</a>) medium-term national recovery policies; and (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cooke et al., 2022</a>) international repercussions of COVID-19 through import/export markets and economic recovery in partner countries (e.g., recent oil price reductions or food price rises).",

In the case of women, as seen in the case of Ebola (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bandiera et al., 2020</a>), in times of a health crisis, women are exposed occupationally and domestically due to their caregiving roles. Beyond this risk of exposure, women are also at the forefront of crisis-management efforts. At the same time, in countries where they have generally lower levels of education, more limited marketable skills, and potentially lower bargaining power, within the household and outside, women can be disproportionately affected by the social and economic consequences of a pandemic. The same is true for marginalized groups. Not only are their income-generating activities more vulnerable to economic shocks, but by increasing competition for resources, the effects of such a crisis could further entrench the sociocultural norms that contribute to their marginalization and vulnerability.",

The two last scenarios account for variations in the extensive and intensive margin on the labour market. The simulation results show that per capita income dropped by 6% but affected decile groups unevenly. The lower deciles were more severely affected, given the limited protection in the informal sector. The poverty incidence rate increased by 13.5%, with slightly weaker effects for female-headed households. The inequality (measured by the Gini index) rose by 3.1%. When including the policy responses, they attenuated the negative impact with an increase in poverty incidence at 7.9% and, for the inequality, the policies almost fully cushioned the negative COVID-19 impact.

Then, they assessed the impact of two existing government policies (Family Protection Bond for Emergency and the unemployment subsidy) to cushion the negative effects of the pandemic-related confinement measures. The simulated results show a sharp decrease in household per capita income by 44% in May 2020, to bound partially back in September 2020 (-10%), driven mainly by the reduction in individual labour income. Consequently, the poverty rate jumped to 57% and then decreased to 30% in May and December 2020, respectively, from a pre-crisis level of around 24%. Results differ within the country, with the rural population, informal workers, indigenous households, and households with young kids being the most affected. Finally, the two government interventions helped poor individuals recover 87% of the losses caused by the COVID-19-related economic shock. Still, they almost entirely failed to protect new people falling below the poverty line (as it reduced by only 1.5 and 0.5 percentage points the poverty increase in May and December).",

Their COVID-19 scenario yields increases in poverty by at least 9 percentage points and 0.45 points for the Gini index.

They performed their analysis for the whole population and for children. They found that the COVID-19 crisis increased poverty incidence by 5.3 and 7.1 percentage points for urban and rural households, respectively and 6 percentage points at the national level. The government measures helped attenuate the poverty impact of the crisis by reducing the impact by 3.1 and 4.8 percentage points for urban and rural households. Finally, the additional measures simulated almost eliminated the negative impact of the crisis by bringing the negative impact to around one percentage point. As for the impact on child poverty, they found that households with younger children are most negatively affected at the national level and in urban areas, while households with children between 5 and 18 years old are the most negatively affected in the rural areas, and the government measures were more efficient in urban areas to attenuate the impact of the crisis.",

From their CGE model, they found that the informal sector underwent a four-fold stronger negative reduction compared to the formal sector and the government income decreased by more than 5%. They found that women were strongly negatively affected but slightly less than men, given their sector of activity. For their poverty analysis, they found increases between 2 and 4%, with the strongest increases in other urban areas (excluding Dakar), followed by the rural areas, and the least affected are the households living in the capital.
