The aim of this paper is to give an overview of the different modules in the LOTTE family \u2013 a non-behavioral tax-benefit model for personal income tax (LOTTE-Skatt), a labor supply model (LOTTE-Arbeid), and a model for distributional effects of commodity taxation (LOTTE-Konsum). In addition to providing descriptions of the designs of the three microsimulation models, we give examples of how the models are used in practical and academic work.",

In LOTTE-Konsum the budget shares for each household are calculated for the baseline (benchmark) situation and used to calculate a household-specific price index. The simulations of the distributional effects of changes in the commodity taxation are then carried out by letting the price index reflect the tax changes. Revenue effects of the same changes are obtained from separate revenue models, run by the Ministry of Finance.",

Thus, the case where a labor supply module works in conjunction with a non-behavioral tax-benefit calculator, such as the LOTTE-Skatt and LOTTE-Arbeid combination, is rather common.

In those early years, model simulations were executed by means of data tapes and punch cards using FORTRAN programming. Model samples in the early days were small, about 13,000 in 1967 (the individual as the unit). Despite this the running time was very high (about 45 minutes).

It is fair to say that implausible structural estimates of taxes on labor supply have contributed to concern about the ability of structural models to generate robust predictions about the effects of policy change (<a href=\"#bib40\">Heckman and Urz\u00faa, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Imbens, 2010</a>). In this perspective, results from (so-called) natural experiments serve as useful information sources for validation of prediction models (<a href=\"#bib14\">Blundell, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Keane, 2010</a>). Here, we demonstrate how simulation results from models like LOTTE-Arbeid can be tested against estimates of the ETI literature.

In order to obtain comparable figures, we therefore let the results of labor supply model simulations enter into a regression similar to that seen in the ETI literature, using the Norwegian tax reform of 2006 as a \u201cnatural experiment\u201d. First, we use LOTTE-Arbeid to simulate the pre-reform and post-reform working hours for four groups of wage earners, the same groups as in <a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a>, see results in <a href=\"#table6\">Table 6</a>. Then these results are converted into measures of growth in (simulated) working hours. In the replication of the ETI econometric framework, the variable for the change in the net-of-tax rate is derived from predicted income levels (hourly wage rate multiplied by predicted hours), and instrumented using similar methods to those of the ETI literature, i.e., the change in the net-of-tax rate for constant (predicted) pre-reform labor income.",

Furthermore, estimates (for all four groups) are found to be in the range 0.02\u20130.06. A difference of 0.04, which is the maximum difference (between results of the two methods) observed for working hours in <a href=\"#table7\">Table 7</a> (single males), must be described as modest, both compared to the variation in elasticity estimates in the literature (see for example the review in <a href=\"#bib16\">Blundell and MaCurdy (1999)</a>), and from a policy prediction perspective. Thus, it is claimed that the model performs well according to this validation. Of course, this does not mean that the simulation model is approved \u2013 it only means that the model has not been rejected by the present test, according to our judgment.

Thus, the effects of a change in a commodity tax (or a commodity price) on the standard of living of each household, and each individual belonging to the household, is defined as total expenditure (possibly adjusted for economies of scale) divided by the household\u2019s price index.

Rather than using observed data directly from a consumer expenditure survey, LOTTE-Konsum is employed to establish underlying stable patterns or trends by means of microeconometric studies, as reflected by Engel elasticity estimates.

Furthermore, the labor supply adjustments imply that payroll tax revenue increases, resulting in an offsetting effect of 12 percent. The direct effect of reduced income tax on revenue from indirect taxes reduces the revenue costs by 12 percent, whereas the additional effect on consumption of increased labor supply reduces the costs by 6 percent.
