We provide new insights into how historical records could be merged with microsimulation outcomes and develop a new indicator for measuring and illustrating individual life course stages in adulthood. Partition of the life course yields the average lengths of life course stages in Finland. We illustrate our indicator and its distribution by gender, cohort and level of education. The proposed indicator is also used to elaborate widely accepted indicators from the Pension Adequacy Report. We conclude that the proposed partitioning method should be easily transferrable to other countries where historical records are available.",

For some time now there has been a drive across Europe to try and prolong working lives and postpone retirement. Pension and labour market policies have been geared to reduce early retirement opportunities, raise pensionable ages, introduce tighter eligibility criteria and to support employment in the ageing workforce (see <a href=\"#bib20\">OECD, 2019a</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">EU EPC, 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">EU AWG, 2021</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">European Commission, 2021</a>.

The single biggest public expenditure item is pension spending. Population ageing has thrust the sustainability of pension schemes firmly into the spotlight. Social transfers and expenditures are ultimately covered from tax revenue collected from businesses and working age individuals. The length of active working life and financially meaningful employment are therefore of paramount interest. But how to measure the length of employment and retirement during the life course in a simple and tractable way, and what is the value added of using simulation techniques to analyse and visualize their respective shares?",

Statistics are collected and compiled in a relatively uniform manner across countries, but their substantive contents or time span are often limited. One example of a much used statistical indicator is the employment rate. Employment rates for employees aged 55\u201359, 60\u201364 and 65\u201369, for instance, give an overview of late career employment trajectories (e.g. <a href=\"#bib20\">OECD, 2019a</a>). Reform success, then, can be assessed by monitoring retirement age based on the average effective age of labour market exit. Ad hoc calculations are useful and often focused on interesting topics, such as career breaks and replacement ratios. They are uniform and based on common assumptions. Furthermore, they usually combine a range of assumptions, statistics and real data on individuals. Simplified example cases are one way of making cross-country and scheme level comparisons, but based on our experience with pension and working life related topics they are often unrealistic. Dynamic microsimulation is an advanced tool for analysing life courses which yields far more accurate information on the variation of indicators across individuals. If detailed longitudinal data are available, microsimulation is definitely the method of choice for analysing life course stages.",

The related indicators measure the key functions of pension systems. According to the report the average duration of retirement in EU countries in 2018 was 20.8 years, down by two years from 2008. In Finland the figure was about 22 years at both points. The PAR report also has a complementary indicator: the ratio between average retirement duration and working life. In 2016 the figure for Finland was 52 per cent (EU 51 per cent). Similar indicators are also used in the OECD\u2019s Pensions at a Glance (2019) report, where they show the remaining life expectancy at labour market exit (<a href=\"#bib20\">OECD, 2019a</a>). Data for Finland show that in 2018, the expected remaining life expectancy (duration of retirement) for men was 19.1 years and for women 23.5 years. Macro or pension system level AWG calculations provide predictions of average contributory time, which can be considered a proxy for length of working life.

Similar cross-country examples are hard to come by. As for expectation-based indicators, <a href=\"#bib12\">Eurostat (2021a)</a> provides time series (since 2000) for the expected duration of working life. The indicator gives the average number of years that a 15-year-old is expected to take part in the workforce during the remaining years of life. In 2019 the figure for Finland was 38.9 years, compared to 35.9 years for EU27 countries (<a href=\"#bib14\">Eurostat, 2020</a>).

The universal public pension system consists of the national pension and the guarantee pension. The national pension system has remained unchanged for decades in terms of the range of benefits and pensionable age (65 yrs.).

The share is likely significantly lower in many other countries with different educational systems and traditions. As paid work is contributory, working life begins relatively early in Finland.

Early retirement became a highly popular option with the introduction of several early retirement benefits in the 1980s. The major pension reform in 2005 lowered the age limit to 18 years, and a flexible retirement age was adopted. Several early retirement benefits have subsequently been discontinued. The latest reform in 2017 introduced parametric changes to current benefits. For example, the age limit for employees was lowered to 17 years. In addition, two new benefits were introduced in the form of a partial old-age pension and years-of-service pension. The partial old-age pension is a subjective benefit and has no restrictions regarding employment while receiving a pension. It has gained strong popularity in its early years (since 2017).

The key point to note here is that the initial measures are not uniform. We cannot replicate the same labour market states for the historical period as in a simulated period. ELSI has detailed states that are designed to measure life course events and states that are relevant from the point of view of current pension and accrual rules. Historical records entail pension rules and life course measures from past decades. For example, we know that there are shortcomings in measuring historical employment that lead to a fragmentary picture of working lives. In this study we made the choice to define employment state prior to 2008 based on the smallest possible duration of employment (&gt;0 days per year). In the simulation period employment is determined separately without considering the number of working days because ELSI does not simulate days. With respect to historical employment, it is also necessary to note that accrual rules were relatively restrictive in the 1960s and 1970s. For instance, the lower age limit for pension accrual was 23 years until 2005. Based on both accrual rules and age limits it is reasonable to assume that for older cohorts, length of working life is an underestimate. On the other hand, length of retirement (time between retirement and death) can be measured reasonably accurately over the whole study period.",

Over the course of the ELSI simulation there are detailed measures for unpaid periods (social security spells), which to some degree are overestimated, as in some situations a short spell can initiate a duration of one year. Historical records provide no similar detailed information on the cause of career brakes, and prior to 2005 some social security spells are interwoven with employment. Overall, the increment for credited periods (pension credited benefit days) can be considered to underestimate the length of social security spells over the life course (until 2005).",

Migration is a fact also in Finland and it has implications on the sustainability indicators of pension system. The selection to limit the analysis on the natives only is based on limited measures about migration. From historical records, migration could be analysed only from 1990s even though it is modeled in detail in the simulation (2008\u20132090).",

Further analysis revealed some differences in the lengths of life course stages between educational groups and gender.

We know that the use of parental benefits has greatly increased over study-period (since 1980s). In Finland mothers use over 90 per cent of parental benefits, which makes comparisons between genders biased. Another issue is related to inconsistencies of longitudinal measures. Short social security spells are either largely missing (1963\u20132007) or overestimated (2008\u20132090). This bias can be seen from the lengths of \u2018Social security spells\u2019 across cohorts.

Assumptions about the duration of working life are a typical situation where two different analytical frameworks (microsimulation vs. macro model) could complement each other.

Our analysis is limited in depicting true life course phenomena, such as time spent in education or on some universal or means-tested social security benefits. These spells are interspersed with other stages of the partition, mainly social security spells (Social security spells), employment and not specified (NA). For this reason, it is important to recognize that the proposed partition of the life course does not measure all sociologically relevant stages of the life course.

By this analysis we can confirm that working lives in Finland are gradually getting longer and retired lives shorter, as expected. In the aftermath of reform new statistics have been complied about length of retrospective working life of the retirees (Pension Indicators). Eurostat publishes similar statistics for other countries. The partition gives a more in-depth view to life course stages, which can already be seen from the statistics. These results also align with the scientific debate on lifespan, namely will the strong growth in mandatory retirement age be politically sustainable when the time for implementation approaches. Length of pension on the other hand has mainly been discussed in the pension industry. For obvious reasons actuaries everywhere are concerned about the financial sustainability of the statutory pension systems.

The population state of fully employed people has been divided into three states to better model the higher unemployment risk of newly employed people; the only way to get to population state 1 is to move from 15 to 16 to 1. A similar arrangement exists with full disability pension. The only way to transition to population state 9 is to go through state 17. This makes the modeling more realistic as the first year on disability pension holds a significantly higher probability of both rehabilitation and death. In most cases, people must also go through state 4 to get to 17. This helps to model the fact that it is usually necessary to receive sickness allowance for about one year before gaining eligibility to a full disability pension.",

For people in population states where everyone is employed (states 15, 16, 1, 10, 5 and 11), the length of working life is advanced by 0.5 years to account for the first 6 months of the year. People in other than these states can also have employment spells, but they are modeled later in the earnings module. Also, people in employed states can have short periods of unemployment or other inactivity that are similarly modeled later in the earnings module.",

In situations where a single LTP population state covers multiple ELSI states, a common multiplier is used for all states. For example, the LTP model only has a single state for primarily employed people. If in ELSI we needed for some age and sex group to decrease the probability of transitioning from primary employment to old-age pension by 10 per cent (to match the LTP model), we would multiply transition probabilities from each of the states 15, 16 and 1 to 8 by 0.9.",

To give an example, say that in the source data 35-year-old women in state 1 with lower tertiary education have a 40 per cent higher probability of transitioning into state 4 than those with upper tertiary education. This ratio will be fixed during the entire simulation period, as the aggregate probability of transitioning from state 1 to state 4 for 35-year-old women is adjusted to match that of the LTP model. A note is in order on the fact that ELSI does not simulate in detail the duration of post-compulsory education, only degrees completed.",

When updating transition probabilities in these cases, the way in which educational level affects the probability of transition is taken from the age (or a range of ages) where the corresponding transition was last possible in the source data. For example, as the retirement age rises, it is possible to become unemployed (transition into state 2) at older ages. The way in which educational level affects the probability of becoming unemployed at these ages is taken from the probabilities of transitioning into unemployment at age 62, as calculated from the source data.",
