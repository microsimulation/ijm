We make use of representative household microdata from ENIGHUR 2011\u20132012, which contains detailed information on labour and non-labour income, taxes and social insurance contributions, public pensions, social benefits and expenditure, as well as personal and household characteristics. First, ECUAMOD, the tax-benefit microsimulation model for Ecuador is used to simulate cash benefit entitlements, personal income tax and social insurance contribution liabilities, as well as indirect taxes. Then, the redistributive effect of simulated tax-benefit policies is compared to that obtained from taxes, social insurance contributions and benefits taken directly from the data. Our results show that simulated taxes and social insurance contributions capture better the number of taxpayers and aggregate revenue amounts from official statistics, compared to information taken directly from the data. Moreover, using reported data on taxes and social insurance contributions underestimates their redistributive effect, compared to simulated policies. Underreporting of income components in survey data and the difficulty of simulating complex eligibility rules for benefits in microsimulation models are some of the factors driving the differences between the two approaches. Our paper concludes with a discussion of the advantages offered by microsimulation for policy analysis.",

As part of the reforms introduced in 2008, personal income tax was made more progressive and tax collection became more efficient. The main social assistance benefit in Ecuador, the Human Development Transfer (HDT), has also been made more generous with the monthly payment increasing from USD 30 to USD 35 in 2009, and then to USD 50 since 2013. Over the last decade, a significant decrease in income inequality was also observed, with the Gini coefficient falling from 55.1 in 2007 to 46.6 in 2016 (<a href=\"#bib12\">INEC, 2016</a>).<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> From a policy perspective, it is important to assess the redistributive role of tax-benefit instruments with the aim of improving their design in order to strengthen social protection in the country.",

The first approach involves using reported information on taxes and benefits from survey data. The second relies on microsimulation techniques to calculate tax-benefit instruments. As stressed by <a href=\"#bib13\">Figari, Iacovou, Skew, and Sutherland (2012)</a>, who carry out a similar analysis for selected EU countries, both approaches are subject to different degrees of error. On the one hand, research using data from developed economies has shown that welfare benefits may be underreported in household surveys (Lynn, J\u00e4ckle, <a href=\"#bib19\">Jenkins, &amp; Sala, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Meyer, Mok, &amp; Sullivan, 2009</a>). On the other hand, microsimulation models might overestimate means-tested benefits if full take-up is assumed (<a href=\"#bib13\">Figari <i>et al</i>., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Figari, Paulus, &amp; Sutherland, 2015</a>).",

However, an integrated microsimulation model encompassing both tax and benefit policies is needed if the objective is to perform distributional analysis. This paper makes use of ECUAMOD, the newly developed tax-benefit microsimulation model for Ecuador. ECUAMOD combines detailed country policy rules with representative household microdata from the National Survey of Income and Expenditures of Urban and Rural Households (Encuesta Nacional de Ingresos y Gastos de Hogares Urbanos y Rurales, ENIGHUR) 2011\u20132012 to simulate cash benefit entitlements, personal income tax and social insurance contribution liabilities, as well as VAT and excise duties for a number of products, for policy years 2011\u20132017. Our study takes advantage of the availability of reported data on social benefits, taxes and social insurance contributions in ENIGHUR to compare their effect on income inequality and poverty to that of simulated tax-benefit components calculated from ECUAMOD.",

Household survey data is generally affected by income underreporting, misreporting and might fail to capture the top of the market income distribution, particularly so in developing countries (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bustos &amp; Leyva, 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">CEPAL-IEF, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Figari <i>et al</i>., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">G\u00f3mez Saba\u00edni &amp; Rossignolo, 2015</a>). Previous studies have further shown that underreporting might be particularly important in the case of self-employment income (<a href=\"#bib21\">Pissarides &amp; Weber, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Besim &amp; Jenkins, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Hurst, Li, &amp; Pugsley, 2014</a>). Empirical evidence on income underreporting and underrepresentation of top incomes in survey data from Ecuador is scarce. <a href=\"#bib5\">Cano (2014)</a> compares information from household surveys and tax records to show that in 2011 the share of income accruing to the top one per cent accounted for ten per cent according to survey data, whereas it accounted for 12.4 per cent based on tax records. The study shows that underreporting seems to be more prevalent among self-employed individuals and this type of income, together with capital income, represent a higher share of total income at the top of the income distribution in Ecuador. Problems of income underreporting or underrepresentation of top market incomes in survey data would necessarily affect results of tax-benefit microsimulation models based on household surveys. For instance, simulated income taxes or social insurance contributions might underestimate aggregate tax revenue from official sources if the survey fails to capture rich households. Note, however, that information on tax payments and benefit receipts collected in survey data might also suffer from underreporting or misreporting. As such, simulated taxes and benefits might provide a better match against administrative statistics than information reported directly in the survey data, depending of the degree of measurement error of each income component (<a href=\"#bib14\">Figari <i>et al</i>., 2015</a>).",

For this reason, research on the redistributive effect of taxes and benefits in Ecuador remains limited. <a href=\"#bib6\">CEPAL-IEF (2014)</a> use household survey data to study the effect of tax-benefit systems on income inequality in Latin America. Results for Ecuador are based on the 2011 National Survey of Urban and Rural Employment, Unemployment and Underemployment (Encuesta Nacional de Empleo, Desempleo y Subempleo, ENEMDUR). Information about cash transfers is taken directly from the data, whereas direct taxes are imputed. According to their results, direct taxes and cash transfers in Ecuador reduce income inequality by 2.8 points, when Gini for disposable income is compared to Gini for market income. Public pensions and cash transfers account for 2 points reduction in inequality, whereas taxes and social insurance contributions account for 0.8 points. More recently, the Commitment to Equity (CEQ) Institute has studied the incidence of taxes and benefits in Latin American countries under a common methodology.<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> <a href=\"#bib18\">Lustig (2017)</a> presents a comparative assessment of the impact of fiscal policy on inequality and poverty in Latin America.

Reported personal income tax provides a poor representation of the number of taxpayers and aggregate tax revenue relative to tax records, capturing only 22 per cent of tax revenue. ECUAMOD simulations match better the external statistics on personal income tax capturing around 82 per cent of income tax revenue, and highlighting the advantages of microsimulation to calculate income components which are difficult to collect in survey data. Our comparison of inequality and poverty indicators calculated from reported ENIGHUR data and simulated ECUAMOD data shows only minor differences between both approaches, with slightly lower estimates obtained with ECUAMOD simulations. Our results depict, however, a very different picture of the redistributive effect of direct taxes and social insurance contributions depending on the approach used in the analysis. Direct taxes (social insurance contributions) reduce inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, only by 0.3 (0.9) points based on ENIGHUR data, whereas the effect is 1 (1.3) point(s) based on ECUAMOD simulations, which reflects the fact that ECUAMOD simulations capture better the number of taxpayers and tax revenue compared to ENIGHUR data.

The underrepresentation in the data is likely to be related to the fact that external statistics report the total number of beneficiaries over the whole year, whereas the survey asks respondents whether they have received the transfer over the past three months. ECUAMOD underestimates the number of recipients of the Human Development Transfer by around 17 per cent compared to external statistics. As mentioned in the previous section, in order to assess eligibility for the HDT in our simulations, we replicated the index of the Social Register with the input data and fixed the threshold of eligibility by identifying the same number of people below the official threshold. Note that this is different from calibrating the number of recipients of the transfer because other eligibility conditions, simulated in ECUAMOD, apply in addition to being below the threshold of the composite index, such as the presence of children in the household or non-affiliation to social security in the case of elderly adults and disabled persons. The underestimation of recipients of the HDT in ECUAMOD could therefore be related to non-fulfilment of eligibility conditions of individuals below the threshold due to differences in characteristics with actual recipients but also to a certain degree of digression from the authorities as to who is considered eligible for the transfer, which cannot be captured in our simulations.",

In particular, ENIGHUR data captures only 43 per cent of personal income taxpayers compared to 70 per cent obtained with ECUAMOD, reflecting the difficulties of collecting tax data in household surveys and highlighting the usefulness of microsimulation to calculate this type of income. The underestimation of self-employed SICs payers in ENIGHUR is related to the fact that the data does not contain information on payments to rural workers\u2019 SICs (Seguro Campesino), which are simulated in ECUAMOD and are included in the official figures. The gap between the number of income taxpayers obtained from ECUAMOD and that of official statistics is most likely driven by income underreporting and underrepresentation of individuals at the top of the market income distribution in ENIGHUR data. Note that in Ecuador (like in many other Latin American countries) deductions from personal expenditures apply to income tax and the exemption threshold for income tax payment is rather high. In 2011, annual incomes below the USD 9,210 threshold were exempt from income tax, whereas the annualised minimum wage was equal to USD 3,168. Most individuals non-affiliated with social security have low earnings and, therefore, even under the assumption of full-compliance in our simulations they would pay no income tax.",

ECUAMOD simulations capture around 82 per cent of revenue from personal income tax and 98 per cent of employee SICs. On the other hand, results obtained directly from ENIGHUR data provide an extremely poor match against the external benchmark. Reported personal income tax amounts from ENIGHUR capture only 22 per cent of personal income tax revenue. Reported employee SICs\u2019 amounts provide a better fit, capturing 88 per cent of employee SICs revenue, compared to 98 per cent captured by ECUAMOD results. The poor representation of aggregate annual revenue from personal income tax provided by ENIGHUR data is most likely related to the abovementioned difficulties of reporting this type of deductions in surveys and points to the importance of using simulated taxes to assess the effect of this component on the income distribution, as its effect would be otherwise underestimated. The underestimation of income tax might also be related to the fact that, in general, surveys fail to properly capture the top of the income distribution and this is particularly the case for developing countries like Ecuador. The comparison of simulated and reported revenue from self-employed SICs with respect to official statistics is rather puzzling. Both simulated and reported results overestimate the revenue from self-employed SICs compared to the external benchmark. The results are counterintuitive given that the number of payers of self-employed SICs obtained from ECUAMOD and ENIGHUR underestimates the number of payers with respect to official statistics. The discrepancies might be related to the categories of workers for which SICs revenue has been reported by the authorities. ECUAMOD and ENIGHUR results consider as self-employed any person reporting income from self-employment, whereas external statistics might be based on people officially registered as self-employed at IESS. Finally, <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a> provides a comparison of aggregate revenue from VAT. Compared with external statistics, ECUAMOD underestimates VAT by around 44 per cent. VAT reported by ENIGHUR represents only 19 per cent of the official aggregate amounts. However, it is worth noting that ENIGHUR reports VAT payments by the self-employed only, as part of their expenditures. VAT payment by households is not directly reported by ENIGHUR. On the other hand, ECUAMOD simulates VAT payments by households only, whereas the official statistics on VAT include payments by both households and firms.",

Simulated direct taxes represent an important proportion (5.4 per cent) of household disposable income only for the top decile of the income distribution. This might be due to the high exemption threshold for income tax payment and also to the presence of deductions from personal expenditures, which are applied to taxable income. Direct taxes reported in the data account only for 1.7 per cent of household disposable income for the top decile. The discrepancies between ECUAMOD and ENIGUR results might be driven by underreporting or misreporting of personal income tax in ENIGHUR and reflect the difficulties of recording this type of income in surveys. Indirect taxes in ECUAMOD are mostly proportional with respect to disposable income, although the relative size of this income component is slightly larger for the first income decile pointing to a minor regressivity. The mostly proportional nature of indirect taxes is in line with a recent paper by <a href=\"#bib30\">Rojas Baez (2017)</a> and is driven by the presence of a zero per cent VAT rate on goods and services considered basic necessities. The relative size of indirect taxes in ENIGHUR is on average smaller than that of ECUAMOD and they appear to affect mostly the top income decile. Differences between ENIGHUR and ECUAMOD results in terms of indirect taxes are due to the fact that ENIGHUR reports VAT payments from expenditures related to self-employment activities only, whereas VAT payments for all households are calculated in ECUAMOD simulations based on expenditure information available in the survey. Finally, reported and simulated social insurance contributions are progressive in nature but represent a smaller share of household disposable income with results based on ENIGHUR data.",

The Suits index measures the ratio between the cumulative proportion of a policy instrument (e.g. income tax) and the cumulative proportion of income. The value of the Suits index lies within the interval [\u22121, 1]. A value of \u22121 would imply an extremely regressive policy instrument (e.g. the poorest person pays all the tax), whereas a value of 1 depicts extreme progressivity (e.g. the richest person pays all the tax). Our results show that direct taxes and SICs are progressive with respect to disposable income but to a larger extent with results obtained from ECUAMOD. Public pensions are regressive, whereas social benefits are progressive. Finally, ECUAMOD and ENIGHUR provide contrasting results in terms of progressivity of indirect taxes. Reported VAT in ENIGHUR are progressive with respect to disposable income, whereas ECUAMOD results point to a minor regressivity of indirect taxes, which is in line with the fairly proportional nature of this income component (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).",

However, as observed in the previous section, the relative size and progressivity of particular tax-benefit components can vary considerably depending on the use of reported or simulated incomes. For instance, reported information on personal income tax payments seems to suffer from underreporting in the survey, which translates into a modest impact of reported income tax on household disposable income (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). ECUAMOD simulations match better external statistics and translate into a larger effect of income tax at the top of the income distribution and therefore lower income inequality. From a policy perspective, it is important to have a clear idea of the effect of individual tax-benefit instruments on poverty and inequality. This is particularly relevant given the different degrees of measurement errors (e.g. underreporting or underrepresentation of top incomes) that individual income components might suffer from. The following section compares the extent to which the effect of tax-benefit components differs depending on whether reported or simulated incomes are used in the analysis.",

Social benefits reduce poverty by 3.4 points and extreme poverty by 2.9 points with both ECUAMOD and ENIGHUR data (column A minus column C). The effect of public pensions is also similar under the two approaches, reducing poverty by around 1.4 points and extreme poverty by around 1 point (column A minus column B). The role played by direct taxes and SICs is, on the other hand, very modest under the two approaches and adding them back to disposable income results in slightly lower poverty levels. Finally, our two approaches provide a very different picture of the effect of indirect taxes. Subtracting indirect taxes from disposable income increases poverty by 2.1 points and extreme poverty by 0.9 points based on simulated data from ECUAMOD, whereas neither poverty nor extreme poverty are affected when reported VAT is deducted from disposable income calculated from ENIGHUR data (column A minus column F).",

On the one hand, the effect of social benefits on income inequality and poverty is similar under the two approaches. However, it is important to bear in mind that ECUAMOD results underestimate the number of HDT beneficiaries due to the complexity of simulating eligibility rules for this cash transfer. On the other hand, the larger effect of simulated direct taxes on income inequality reflects the fact that reported tax payments in the data suffer from underreporting or misreporting and therefore simulating personal income tax based on market income information available in the survey captures a larger number of taxpayers. As noted before, problems of underreporting and underrepresentation of the top of the market income distribution also result in an underestimation of tax revenue if ECUAMOD results are compared to external statistics. Finally, the use of comparable income information under both approaches has an important effect on the results. Our two approaches provide a very different picture of the effect of indirect taxes. This is due to the fact that indirect taxes reported in ENIGHUR relate only to VAT payments from expenditures linked to self-employment activities, whereas ECUAMOD results represent VAT payments by all households calculated from expenditure information available in the survey.",

In this paper, we compared the redistributive effect of taxes and benefits in Ecuador under two different approaches.

Our results show that ENIGHUR data provides a poor representation of the number of taxpayers and aggregate tax revenue relative to tax records, which is most likely related to underreporting or misreporting. ECUAMOD simulations of personal income tax match better external statistics, but still capture only 82 per cent of tax revenue. Income underreporting and underrepresentation of rich individuals in household survey data are the likely drivers of this discrepancy as market income information is taken directly from ENIGHUR data for the simulation of income tax. In terms of benefits, ENIGHUR data captures very well the number of recipients and aggregate amounts of the Human Development Transfer, the main social assistance benefit in Ecuador. ECUAMOD simulations, on the other hand, underestimate the number of HDT beneficiaries and aggregate expenditure. This reflects the difficulties of simulating complex eligibility rules in microsimulation models, in our case, reproducing the composite index of eligibility for the Human Development Transfer.",

Inequality and poverty indicators obtained from ECUAMOD simulations slightly underestimate those based on ENIGHUR data. The Gini coefficient for disposable income is 1.6 points lower with ECUAMOD data compared to ENIGHUR data (46.1 compared to 47.7), whereas the absolute poverty headcount is 0.9 points lower (20.8 compared to 21.7). Under both approaches, social assistance benefits are the instrument that has the largest effect in inequality reduction and the size of its effect is similar with ENIGHUR and ECUAMOD data. However, important differences between the two approaches are observed in terms of the redistributive effect of direct taxes. Based on ENIGHUR data, direct taxes reduce inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, only by 0.3 points, whereas the effect is of 1 point based on ECUAMOD simulations. The discrepancies between the two approaches reflect the fact that personal income tax is poorly captured in the household survey data. As such, our results point to a much larger effect of direct taxes in reducing inequality compared to previous studies, which have either used reported incomes or imputed taxes from other sources into survey data.",

An alternative direction for the study of the redistributive effect of actual tax-benefit systems could have made use only of those simulated components which match better external statistics; in our case, social insurance contributions and personal income tax. The redistributive effects of the tax-benefit system in Ecuador under such exercise are similar to those of ECUAMOD, as it is mainly the redistributive effect of income taxes that differs between the two approaches. It should be noted, however, that the study of the redistributive effect of actual or current tax-benefit policies is only one of many applications of microsimulation models. In principle, simulating as many instruments as possible is more desirable for exercises in which reforms to such policies would be simulated.",

First, the underestimation of the number of taxpayers and aggregate tax revenue from ECUAMOD simulations, due to problems underreporting and underrepresentation of the top of the market income distribution in household surveys, points to the need of enriching survey data. Imputations based on administrative tax records could be considered in future versions of the model to assess their impact on the simulations. Second, the possibility of relaxing the assumption of full compliance with tax rules should be considered through the simulation of some sort of tax-evasion based on information collected by the public administration or on different definitions of informality. Third, we should consider extending the scope of our simulations to provide a broader picture of the role of the welfare state, for instance, through simulating indirect fuel subsidies. Finally, the development of a regional tax-benefit microsimulation model for Latin America, using a common harmonised language, represents an important opportunity for policy developments and collaborations within the region. Progress on this area is already being made with the development of a microsimulation model for Colombia, which allows performing comparative analysis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bargain, Jara, &amp; Rodriguez, 2017</a>). All these issues represent promising areas for future research.",
