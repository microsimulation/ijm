                "text": "In Europe, many people experience financial hardship due to healthcare payments, despite (near-)universal healthcare. In Finland and other countries, austerity has further widened the gaps in coverage through increases in patient payments. However, distributional analyses of austerity have solely concentrated on the effects of tax-benefit policies. We present a method for examining how health payment policies and tax-benefit policies affect household income in conjunction to evaluate the total effect of implemented and planned policies. We linked the national tax-benefit microsimulation model, <i>SISU</i>, and its nationally representative 15% sample of households in 2017 (n=826,001) with administrative real-world healthcare data (Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare Care Register for Health Care, <i>HILMO</i>, and Social Insurance Institution of Finland, <i>Kela</i>, National Health Insurance reimbursement registers). As a case study, we analysed the effects on the relative poverty risk and poverty gap during two government terms. We found that between 2011 and 2015, tax-benefit policies contributed to decreasing relative poverty, and health payment changes had no measurable effects. From 2015 to 2019, the poverty risk rate and the average gap increased due to tax-benefit policies, and health payment changes strengthened the effects by 10% to 20%. Health payments and their increases deteriorated the position of older adults; nevertheless, their poverty risk remained close to the population average. Social assistance had an important buffering effect on the under 65-year-old population. Health payment increases thus exacerbated the effects of austerity on the oldest age groups. Furthermore, based on tax-benefit analyses alone, they were relatively well-protected.",

Simultaneously, the varying policy responses affected household incomes either through discretionary changes in tax-benefit policies or automatic stabilisers (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bozio et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Paulus and Tasseva, 2020</a>). Problems accessing healthcare have increased in Europe; however, these effects could be attributed to several causes besides health payments, including the effects of rising unemployment on disposable incomes and the decrease in available services due to direct cuts in spending (<a href=\"#bib17\">Eurofound, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Karanikolos et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Reeves et al., 2015</a>).",

Thus, austerity was pronounced relatively late, during Prime Minister (PM) Sipil\u00e4\u2019s tenure (2015\u20132019) (Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2019).",

Ensuing these exclusions, we calculated class-specific price indices for the 40 ATC classes, which represented over 80% of the total costs and co-payment expenditures of all reimbursed medicine purchases in 2017. For products in these classes, we used class-specific price indices, and for other products, we used the volume-weighted (based on DDDs) mean index of these 40 classes.",

The poverty risk rate is the share of people with equivalised disposable income after social transfers below the threshold, which is tied to the national median equivalised disposable income after social transfers. We used 60% and 50% of the national median as the thresholds. To measure the impoverishing effects on people already below the threshold, we measured the poverty gap, that is, the median equivalised disposable income of people below the threshold, as a percentage of the threshold.

When using observed prices (IPI), medicine co-payment expenditures seemed to exhibit a more pronounced decreasing trend, apart from the years when co-payment increases were implemented. This can be attributed to the effects of ongoing regulation, price competition, and multiple policies targeting prices. Decreasing prices counterbalanced the effects of co-payment increases, leading to a slower growth rate in the mean co-payment expenditure than expected based on the CPI (5% vs. 23% between 2011 and 2019). Co-payment expenditure growth was more rapid during the prior government period than the latter when using the IPI, whereas the assumption that prices followed the CPI suggested the opposite.",

The buffering effect of social assistance and price regulation of medicines counterbalanced the effects of co-payment increases. Conversely, payments for private services increased because of payment policies and the rapid growth of unregulated prices. Although small when juxtaposed with tax-benefit policies, our analysis revealed the scope of the effect of health payment policies, which had been hidden in previous analyses.",

However, it should be noted that in the Finnish settings of multiparty coalitions and the heavy influence of unions, the development of social policies can only partly be attributed to partisan effects (<a href=\"#bib57\">Varjonen et al., 2020</a>). Prior to our examination period, the government of PM Vanhanen (2007\u20132011) reacted to the global financial crisis with an emphasis on fortifying basic social security (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kangas, 2019</a>). PM Katainen\u2019s and PM Stubb\u2019s government programs (2011\u20132015) were influenced by austerity, however, alongside the traditional redistribution perspective and ideas of social investment. PM Sipil\u00e4\u2019s government programme (2015\u20132019) was characterised by austerity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nyg\u00e5rd et al., 2019</a>).",

Although health payments increased during that time, they had negligible effects on relative poverty outcomes. Conversely, during 2015\u20132019, reforms were characterised by austerity, leading to increases in poverty outcomes mainly driven by tax-benefit policies, but further reinforced by increases in health payments, which accounted for 10% of the poverty risk-increasing effect, whereas tax-benefit policies accounted for the rest (90%). The role of health payments was greater (20%) in the older adult population. Based on the simulations, social assistance buffered half of the poverty-increasing effects of the reforms.",

Our results shed light on the combined effects of these factors. Before accounting for health payments, older adults had a lower risk of poverty and a low poverty gap in relation to the population average. Thus, accounting for health payments brought them closer to, although mostly below, the average. In the general population, health payments had a minor effect on the poverty risk rate and the poverty gap because their level was, on average, moderate. Moreover, households with the lowest income were largely buffered by social assistance. For older adults, social assistance has no buffering effect because of the relatively low poverty gap in these households.",

Reimbursed medicines present an example of heavy price regulation, and accordingly, price development seems to effectively counterbalance the effects of increases in patient payments. Thus, assuming prices follow a general price index, such as the CPI, would have led to an overestimation of their effects. Prices of fee-for-service-based private services grew notably faster than inflation; thus, using the CPI would have led to an underestimation of their effects.",

Nevertheless, the difference between households eligible before and after health payments was small, implying that households requiring social assistance for health payments were predominantly eligible.",

Other important future developments in planning include modelling the behavioural effects of patient payments on take-up and extending the method to examine the distributional effects of in-kind transfers (<a href=\"#bib19\">Figari and Paulus, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Vaalavuo, 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Verbist et al., 2013</a>).

Access problems may arise from issues related to affordability, availability, accessibility and acceptability (<a href=\"#bib28\">Levesque et al., 2013</a>). Second, despite using comprehensive microdata, important aspects relevant to household economic conditions were not captured by the administrative registers. We combined the assessment of tax-benefit and health payment legislation by using a modified income concept, where we deducted the payments from household income. This is partly problematic, as health consumption may also be driven by unobserved savings and loans. However, this bias is not relevant when focusing on the change in the effect rather than the cross-sectional level of the effect. Moreover, this may be the most feasible solution to simultaneously measure the effects of income- and consumption-based policies. Third, the simulation of income-tested benefits, such as social assistance, incorporated many sources of potential measurement errors. These were simulated by assuming full take-up, although prevalent non-take-up has been observed (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tervola et al., 2021b</a>). Furthermore, assets and income from informal sources, counted as income in social assistance, were not observed in the data; simulation was based on average monthly income during a year; therefore, part-year eligibility was often unobserved. Thus, the effects on poverty may have been underestimated in these simulations.",
