                "text": "Welfare policies have often been assessed on their financial impacts, for example, their effects on net household incomes and marginal and average tax rates. However, welfare policies can also have a substantial effect on population health and wellbeing. In addition, politicians must consider the electoral implications of policies that would affect large sections of the population. In this article we describe a new microsimulation model with a public-facing user interface, the Public Policy Preference Calculator (TriplePC), which enables automated assessment of economic and health impacts as well as public preferences for particular, customisable welfare policies. The TriplePC uses data from, and regressions based on, major UK sources such as the Family Resources Survey, Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) and the Wealth and Assets Survey, alongside our own conjoint experimental surveys on public preferences. While the design of the conjoint survey necessitated relatively strong assumptions in some areas, the TriplePC\u2019s ability to simultaneously model the financial, health and political implications of a policy is, we believe, unique. TriplePC was developed over approximately four months as part of a project on income and health funded by National Institute for Health and Care Research. We view TriplePC as a highly promising prototype rather than the finished article; in this paper we will describe it \u2018warts and all\u2019, highlighting areas of particular uncertainty and the lessons learned we hope to apply to future, fuller developed versions.",

This is novel and important. There are measures that might actually be popular, but which policymakers have been unwilling to touch because of uncertainty about their electoral consequences. Perhaps the best example from UK history is the SDP/Liberal Democrat\u2019s \u2018Dead Parrot\u2019 merger manifesto of January 1988 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gourley, 2023</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Crewe and King, 1995</a>), which proposed the abolition of Child Benefit and the imposition of a uniform rate of Value Added Tax (VAT) to raise money for an anti-poverty program. Although this had been modelled in detail, fear of the electoral consequences among Members of Parliament meant the manifesto was abandoned within a day. The resulting confusion and indecision arguably caused long-lasting damage to centrist politics in the UK (<a href=\"#bib13\">Crewe and King, 1995</a>). The UK\u2019s zero-rating for food and children\u2019s clothing remains politically untouchable to this day despite the orthodox economic arguments in favour of a uniform rate (<a href=\"#bib12\">Crawford et al., 2010</a>). But would VAT extension really be unpopular, especially if it was part of a package that used the money raised for poverty reduction or other appealing policies? Our approach allows us to address questions like this.",

This is estimated to have risen from 19% in 2011/12 to 24% in 2021/22, an increase of 3.9 million people (<a href=\"#bib14\">Department for Work and Pensions, 2023</a>). Indeed, the estimate increased from 14.1 million in 2019/20 to 16.0 million in 2021/22 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Department for Work and Pensions, 2023</a>). Interestingly, the proportion among state pension age adults has remained the same between 2011/12 and 2021/22 at 45%, whereas for working-age adults it has increased from 16% to 23% and for children the figures are 6% to 11%.

Note that many of these randomly generated pairs are totally implausible. This is integral to how a fully randomized conjoint analysis works: by generating all the possible combinations, things that are actually correlated in real life (e.g. tax rates and poverty rates) are rendered orthogonal to one another.

The AMCE for a given level of an attribute can be interpreted as the marginal effect on the probability of choice of the attribute being at that level compared to the reference level, averaging across the possible levels of all other attributes. Through randomization and a high number of pairwise comparisons, this allows us to quantify the causal effect of including specific levels of individual reform elements on the support for the entire reform package, compared with the support for a reform package that contains the baseline level (status quo) of this particular reform element (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nettle et al., 2023</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Nettle et al., 2024</a>). For sub-group analysis, we used ANOVA to test formally whether including interactions between the subgroup identity and the attribute improved model fit. We then compared the marginal mean probabilities of choice for each attribute level between subgroups and used z-tests to establish where the significant differences resided. All analyses were carried out using the cregg R package.(<a href=\"#bib31\">Leeper, 2020</a>).

The adult payments reduce headcount poverty by 3% but child poverty rises by 0.7%, since the Child Benefit abolition more than offsets the gains to parents from the adult payments.

In any case, for a household-based microsimulation model, what matters is the incidence of the tax on the households. This could be on profits, or passed on in price increases or real wage reductions (<a href=\"#bib57\">Harberger, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Atkinson and Stiglitz, 2015</a>). If we make a simple \u2018small country\u2019 assumption \u2013 that the rate of return on capital and the price of tradeable goods are set exogenously on world markets \u2013 then Corporation Tax is ultimately incident on (private sector) wages and self-employment income. Therefore, we calculate the tax increase needed to meet the costs of the benefit increase and reduce the wage bill by that amount. Note that as the wage bill falls, direct tax revenues also fall, but in a non-linear way because of the tax allowance and progressive tax rate structures, so finding the correct Corporation Tax increase requires the use of our root-finder. In practice the rates needed for the more generous benefit increases can be implausibly large, exceeding in some cases total UK Corporation\u2019s Gross Profits.",

Although it is technically straightforward to quantify uncertainty by running the model multiple times and reporting ranked outcomes, we are reluctant to do so because we feel that it gives a false sense of certainty, by implying that the principal uncertainties around microsimulation models can be captured with a few extra loops. Some sources of error can be quantified by bootstrapping, such as sampling errors in the data, the regression error terms and, to some extent, uncertainty around matching. However, the critical sources of error in microsimulation models \u2013 specification and implementation errors in programming and inappropriate data \u2013 cannot be quantified in this way. And in any event a bootstrapping model would be too slow to be useful interactively, unless run on more processors than it is feasible to fund for this project. The best defences are instead a good test suite, clearly written code and openness and we are happy to have made all data freely available.",
