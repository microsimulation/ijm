Using a static tax-benefit microsimulation model with input datasets that were adjusted to reflect people\u2019s earned incomes just before the pandemic (March 2020) and during the first national lockdown (April 2020), we investigate how well the social protection system in South Africa was able to mitigate the economic losses to the public. We take into account both the existing benefit system that was in place before the crisis and the role of the new policy measures that were introduced in April, May, and June 2020.",

The main objective of our analysis is to investigate how well the social protection system in South Africa was able to mitigate the economic losses to the public.

These results are the same for April, May, and June as the input dataset and non-COVID-19 policies remain constant, but are shown for each month for completeness. In a hypothetical situation with no COVID-19 policies, it can be seen that poverty would have risen to 0.321 each month using the food poverty line (a 56 per cent increase from the baseline in March), and to 0.452 using the lower-bound poverty line (a 37 per cent increase from the baseline in March), and to 0.593 using the upper-bound poverty line (a 23 per cent increase from the baseline in March).",

For households containing one or more older people, poverty (as measured using the food poverty line) is almost obliterated. This will be driven by the R250 increase to the Old Age Grant from May onwards. The fall in poverty between the months of May and June will be due to the combined impact of the transition from an increase to the Child Support Grant payment (which occurred only in May) to a Caregiver SRD benefit (which started in June), and an improved role-out of the COVID-SRD benefit, as the number of beneficiaries increased from 4.4 million in May to almost 5.1 million people in June.",

It sought to use information from the NIDS Wave 5 survey of 2017 to investigate a set of emergency policies to support informal workers whose employment and earnings would be halted by a lockdown but who would not receive any relief through systems such as the UIF that rely on formal registration of employment. The evidence from NIDS Wave 5 was used to show that a very large proportion of such informal workers reside in households in the bottom deciles of the income distribution in which there are recipients of existing social grants, in particular the CSG. This made a case therefore that this grant could be re-purposed to provide substantial emergency relief to these workers and their households. They also showed that, if it were feasible to implement, a \u2018Special COVID-19 Grant\u2019 broadly targeting the unemployed and those in informal employment would be very effective in assisting these informal workers and mitigating COVID-19-associated poverty.",

Since then, the Caregiver-SRD grant and the increased monthly payments of the existing benefits by government ceased in October 2020. Furthermore the COVID-SRD benefit was terminated at the end of April 2021. Our work here suggests that the poverty situation therefore probably worsened in late 2020 compared to our study period. The country is now (in June 2021) embarking on a serious third wave during the winter season, and so the vital support that was provided during the first wave continues to be sorely missed.",

The success of especially the COVID-19 benefit changes in poverty reduction underscores the need to have similar transfers in place in more normal times as well. That said, the present system was implemented as an emergency response and it should be further developed if it is to be made more permanent. For example, the COVID-SRD was put in place in great haste to fill a gap in emergency funding, and its application procedures are not easy to work with for potential beneficiaries. They could be simplified within a design framework that splices this grant into an integrated system of grants. Similarly, the means test for receiving SRD is exceptionally stringent (requiring applicants to have zero income) and it would need to be reconsidered and harmonized with those being applied to the other social grants. Introducing new benefits is costly, of course, but financing options exist. Also, in the spirit of this study, going forward there is so much to be learned for policy prioritization by careful evaluation of the effectiveness of policies in guiding the country through the COVID pandemic.",

Second, the reweighting was performed again, this time controlling to demographic and labour market profiles for March 2020. The advantage of adopting this two-stage approach is that it enables an assessment of the magnitude of weight changes at each stage. The demographic profiles were derived from Statistics South Africa\u2019s population estimates by population group, age, and sex.

Respecting these probabilities, individuals were randomly assigned to <i>employed with no drop in earnings</i>, <i>employed with a drop in earnings</i>, <i>furloughed</i>, and <i>no longer employed</i> categories. In essence, the probability space between 0 and 1 is divided in accordance with each individual\u2019s probabilities of entering different states. Then, a random draw between 0 and 1 determines their assigned outcome. For example, someone who had a predicted probability of becoming furloughed of 0.1 would have only a 10 per cent chance of being assigned furloughed, but could still get this outcome should their random draw align with this outcome. However, the overall distribution of predicted outcomes will broadly follow the mean probabilities of entering each state because of the weighting of the probability space. Further, if the model is capturing the characteristics that determined employment changes, then the simulation should also capture the distribution of employment effects across different kinds of workers.",

This means we are capturing the general picture in terms of April employment outcomes well. However, beyond this there was not as much correlation between actual and simulated outcomes as one would hope (probably because of a lack of predictive power in the model in general). This means that many people will have a simulated April outcome that is different to their actual outcome as represented in NIDS-CRAM. However, since not all individuals in the NIDS microsimulation baseline data were included in NIDS-CRAM, predictions cannot be avoided. Therefore, we chose to use the predicted employment status for all observations to have a harmonized treatment across all individuals and households in the dataset underpinning the microsimulation model.",

NIDS-CRAM has an estimated employment rate of 45 per cent relative to 33 per cent in the SAMOD data. This is probably driven by the calibration to the QLFS labour market profile, which generally has lower estimates of employment, and by the fact that only job loss and not job gain (between February and April) were modelled. Unemployment rates were similar across datasets, while estimated economic inactivity was a lot higher in SAMOD relative to NIDS-CRAM. Finally, as a consequence of the way SAMOD was weighted, the total estimated population was substantially larger in SAMOD relative to NIDS-CRAM.",
