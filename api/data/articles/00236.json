Using a static tax and microsimulation model for Indonesia with adjusted datasets to reflect the economic shock throughout 2020, we explore how the pandemic affected people\u2019s earnings in Indonesia, the extent to which the automatic stabilisers that were already built into the tax and benefit system cushioned the economic shock, and how the augmented or new benefit policies served to further cushion the shock. We estimate that in 2020 the additional policies meant that poverty rose from 6.8 percent to a maximum of 8.3 percent rather than to 10.7 percent if they had not been introduced. We discuss reasons why the official poverty estimates for 2020 are higher than those generated in this study.",

In the absence of any known cures or preventative vaccines, governments quickly implemented policies to minimize its impact. In particular, public health policies were rolled out which focused on containing the spread of the virus but these measures in turn had a detrimental impact on many economies, at least in the short-run. In addition, tax and benefit policies were often either augmented or introduced from scratch, in order to mitigate the financial impact of the pandemic and associated containment measures on people\u2019s lives. The speed with which initiatives were introduced has been unprecedented: for example, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights observed that 1,407 new social protection measures had been adopted by 208 countries and territories by September 2020 (<a href=\"#bib29\">United Nations, 2020</a>).",

First, we provide a methodology for nowcasting quarterly income shocks using a technique that draws from anonymized phone data on people\u2019s mobility patterns to estimate the COVID-related shock on economic activity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Carlitz and Makhura, 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Sampi and Jooste, 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Yusuf et al., 2020</a>). Second, the analysis is based on very timely data derived from the National Socio-Economic Survey Indonesia (SUSENAS) 2019 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS), 2019</a>), including individual level income data from the survey which is not usually available for external research purposes. This provides an opportunity for an in-depth analysis of income changes along the distribution and for different population sub-groups. Third and most importantly, the paper focuses on the role of the tax-benefit system in cushioning the consequences of the pandemic. Fourth, this is possible due to the state-of-the-art microsimulation model INDOMOD which allows us to monitor the impact of policies in a timely manner and to decompose the role of existing tax-benefit policies versus the effectiveness of emergency policies. Fifth, modelling the different tax and benefit policies that were in place for each month in the calendar year of 2020, it is possible to unpick in a very detailed way the role that the tax and benefit system has played in mitigating the impact of the pandemic on poverty and inequality. This shows the extent to which the social policy response during the year was successful and also provides pointers for further support to avoid more severe long-term effects on incomes after the pandemic.",

For example, for households containing one or more children, poverty would have risen to a high of 11.99 percent in May 2020 without the COVID-19 policies, but instead rose to 9.49 percent, and for households containing one or more elderly people, poverty would have risen to a high of 14.25 percent without the COVID-19 policies, but instead rose to 11.40 percent.",

Most of the adjustment is therefore made at the extensive margin. However, when calculating cumulative income totals across weighted survey cases in this way, it is inevitable that the cumulative total will fall either just below or just above the target threshold of the aggregate shock estimate, depending on how many cases are included in the shock (as one weighted survey case in the cumulative distribution will inevitably straddle the threshold value). Therefore, in order to achieve a total income shock from the survey that matched exactly with the aggregate income shock, a further adjustment was made at the intensive margin whereby a uniform scaling adjustment was applied to all remaining workers.",

This was applied to individuals based on their industry and province. For each of quarters 2, 3 and 4, the starting point was the situation in quarter 1 and the relevant shock for the quarter was applied, as described above. Therefore, over the year, for example, an individual in a particular sector might have their earnings reduced to zero (and employment status changed to \u2018unemployed\u2019) in quarters 2 and 3, but then return to their quarter 1 situation for quarter 4 if there is a recovery in their particular industry and province.

First, consumption was allocated to each earner within the household in proportion to their pre-shock earnings, and then for each earner, 25 percent of their consumption was ringfenced as a crude proxy for an undifferentiated mix of consumption achieved via home grown production, use of savings, or the incurring of debt.

For both sub-groups, and for the overall population, poverty increased a little between October and December 2020: this is likely to be due to the phasing out of the pre-employment card and wage subsidy COVID-19 policies (see <a href=\"#app3\">Annex 3</a>).",

In order to explore the role of different types of COVID policies, they were grouped into four separate categories: increases to existing benefits, new cash support, new food assistance, and new work-related benefits. Analysis was undertaken to explore the role of these four categories at the mid-points of quarters 2-4 (i.e. May, August and November 2020) \u2013 see <a href=\"#table5\">Table 5</a>. This reveals that the increases to existing benefits made the greatest contribution to poverty reduction in May (44 per cent), followed by cash support (33 per cent). However, in August and November, work-related benefits made the greatest contribution to poverty reduction (51 per cent and 56 per cent respectively). This demonstrates that the policy scene underwent considerable changes during 2020, not just between the period of the first quarter (pre-pandemic) and the rest of the year, but also between quarter 2 and quarter 3 in terms of the augmented support for people of working age.",

We estimated the impact of the pandemic and associated lockdown on people\u2019s jobs and earnings, using published economic growth data for quarters 2 and 3, and for quarter 4 the impact of the shock was modelled using open source mobility data. Second, the shock was applied to the SUSENAS 2019 dataset by sub-group (sector and province) but there will of course have been variations within each sub-group that are not taken into account. Third, we do not estimate the impact of additional shocks (such as illness or changes in material needs or expenditure patterns) which would have been captured in SUSENAS 2020. And fourth (though this is a counter point) we do not estimate the impact of the unsimulated policies such as the electricity subsidy. Lastly, we simulate the \u2018de jure\u2019 tax and benefit rules, rather than the \u2018de facto\u2019 application: by assigning benefits to the poorest households within SUSENAS, the benefits will be more precisely assigned to the poorest individuals in our simulations than could occur in practice where eligibility is often determined using the <i>Basis Data Terpadu</i> (Unified Database).",

There are 33 urban poverty lines and 33 rural poverty lines for each of the provinces other than Jakarta, and one urban poverty line for Jakarta. The variation in poverty lines reflects the variation in prices throughout the country, and so the poverty line variation was accordingly used to adjust per capita expenditure in INDOMOD\u2019s input dataset. A multiplier was used to convert all expenditure data to Jakarta prices, which was achieved simply by dividing the Jakarta poverty line for 2019 by the poverty lines of all other provinces (both the urban and rural poverty lines were used).",

For each of these policies, the rules state that the next x million families not in receipt of PKH or BPNT would be eligible for the COVID benefit. Prior to April 2020, when these benefits commenced, the poorest 9.2 million families (households in INDOMOD) received PKH and the poorest 15.6 million families/households received BPNT/Sembako, meaning that 9.2 million households in INDOMOD will receive both PKH and BPNT/Sembako, and an extra 6.4 million households will receive BPNT only. Therefore, any family/household in the poorest 15.6 million would not be eligible for the COVID benefits within INDOMOD as they would be receiving either both PKH and BPNT or just BPNT. In order to calculate the next x million families/households eligible for the COVID benefits, a new ranking of households starting at 15.6 million was calculated within each area (Jabodetabek, non-Bodetabek urban, non-Bodetabek rural) called xcujk, xcunu, xcunr respectively. Using the relevant xcu variable it was then possible to select, on model, the poorest x million not in receipt of PKH or BPNT in a particular area targeted by the benefit.",
