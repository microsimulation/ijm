By 2020, only Sweden will be above the Europe 2020 target of 75% employment rate, though Ireland will be close; the target will be approached by all other countries only at the end of the simulation period at 2050, with the exception of Hungary. Our forecasts, that fully take into account the uncertainty coming from the estimation of all the processes in the microsimulation, significantly depart from the official projections of the European Commission for two of the six countries under analysis.",

Indeed, over the last two decades, EU strategies have focused on fostering a higher participation of women in the labour market. However, without social and labour market policies that help reconciliation of work and family responsibilities, increased female participation may produce a decline in the total fertility rate (<a href=\"#ref58\">Kohler, Billari, &amp; Ortega, 2002)</a>, as women postpone childbearing in order either to enter the workforce or to avoid putting their professional careers at risk. Of particular relevance are family support policies, such as childcare services (<a href=\"#ref13\">Blau, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#ref11\">Berlinski &amp; Galiani, 2007</a>) and paid parental leave (<a href=\"#ref68\">Pronzato, 2009</a>), and policies directed at increasing part-time work opportunities (<a href=\"#ref66\">Paull, 2008</a>). Paid parental leave and childcare services decrease the cost of child-rearing and help parents reconcile work and family life; the availability of flexible working-time arrangements and in particular the possibility to work part-time helps women to combine market work with traditional family responsibilities. While childcare services have an unambiguous positive effect on participation, both long-term leave and part time jobs can have the effect of detaching women from the labour market, penalising their working career and reducing disposable income, further hampering their empowerment. It is therefore an empirical issue to determine whether and under what circumstances a positive or a negative overall effect prevails.",

Understanding these dynamics is instrumental to investigating the expected effects of different policies aimed at supporting better education, helping with family-work reconciliation, and delaying retirement. More specifically, we adopt Sweden as a benchmark, representative of the Nordic group of high participation countries, and study Italy, Spain and Hungary from the \u201clong leave \u2013 low cash benefits\u201d group, Greece from the \u201climited assistance\u201d group and Ireland from the \u201cshort leave -low cash benefits\u201d group.<sup><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup>",

While the focus of that literature has been mainly on participation rates for the (white) male population (<a href=\"#ref31\">Eberstadt, 2017</a>), the methods used are the same we review in this paper. Hence, our suggestion to follow a microsimulation approach, which we substantiate in <a href=\"#s4\">Section 4</a> below, can apply to that literature as well. Projecting the complex and intertwined dynamics forward in time is of course difficult. Most forecasting exercises, generally performed by governmental institutions at a national level, or by international organisations such as the International Labour Organization (ILO), OECD or the European Commission, focus therefore on only one aggregate outcome variable of interest (for example, female participation), assuming an exogenous evolution for its determinants. By contrast, in this paper we employ a dynamic microsimulation model (MSM) (<a href=\"#ref61\">Li &amp; O\u2019Donoghue, 2013</a>), which challenges both assumptions underlying most official projection models (i) participation is estimated (and projected) at the individual level, and (ii) the model also evolves the determinants of participation, based on additional regression models estimated in the data. The advantage of the microsimulation approach is threefold. First, aggregation can be performed ex-post on any sub-population of interest. Second, by providing projections on a possibly large set of outcomes, dynamic microsimulations allow for a more comprehensive analysis of participation, and its complex relationship with other life course events. Third, by endogenizing the evolution of the determinants of participation, dynamic microsimulations allow for a more comprehensive quantification of the uncertainty surrounding the projections. We exploit these features by analysing education, household formation and dissolution, fertility decisions, labour force participation, employment outcomes, retirement decisions and ultimately death within the same model. Moreover, we provide projections for both men and women, starting from representative samples of the population in the base year, for each country.",

Although a convergence process seems to be under way, heterogeneity among EU countries is still high (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

Equal employment opportunities and work-family balance are pointed out as priorities. This was followed by the European Pact for Gender Equality and the Roadmap for equality between women and men 2006\u20132010, updated in the Strategy for equality between women and men 2010\u20132015 (<a href=\"#ref45\">European Council, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#ref33\">European Commission, 2006</a>, <a href=\"#ref35\">2011</a>). In these documents, the European Commission proposed concrete actions for addressing a number of issues such as economic independence of women and equality in decision making. The Europe 2020 Strategy, by acknowledging that \u201cpolicies to promote gender equality will be needed to increase labour force participation thus adding to growth and social cohesion\u201d, sets among its targets for 2020 an overall employment rate of 75% across the population (see <a href=\"#ref34\">European Commission, 2010</a>, p. 17). Furthermore, in the Social Investment Package, the <a href=\"#ref34\">European Commission (2013)</a> reaffirmed the importance of fostering higher participation of women. According to this document, gender gaps in employment rates, as well as other gender disparities in the labour market, need to be reduced or eliminated in order to decrease the risk of social exclusion and poverty for women and to achieve inclusive growth.

These differences are to some extent rooted in culture and social norms but they also reflect differences in the economic and demographic structure, as well as institutions and economic incentives. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> shows raw cross-country correlations between female participation rates and some key demographic and economic variables, at the EU level. Female participation appears to be only loosely related to population ageing, with if anything more participation in countries with an older population, and positively related to fertility rate, education, and the generosity of family policies. The large literature on the determinants of female labour force participation (see for instance <a href=\"#ref74\">Saurel-Cubizolles <i>et al</i>., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#ref17\">Bratti, Del Bono, &amp; Vuri, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#ref7\">Attanasio, Low, &amp; Sanchez-Marcos, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#ref50\">Genre, Gomez-Salvador, &amp; Lamo, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#ref21\">Cipollone &amp; D\u2019Ippoliti, 2011</a>) has investigated these relationships in a multivariate setting, stressing the role of composition effects (for example female participation is higher, on average, in countries with an older population because the share of students is lower and because the share of mothers with young children is also lower) and reverse causation (for example women can better afford having children if they have a job). The complexity of the relationship between demography and labour force participation also points to a crucial role of policies. <a href=\"#ref76\">Th\u00e9venon (2011)</a> performs a principal component analysis aimed at identifying the most important characteristics of family policy packages in OECD countries. He finds two main components: one related to support allowing parents to combine work with childcare, and another related to the generosity of leave entitlements in terms of money and duration. Across the range of these two components, he notes that countries adopt one of five broad categories of family policy, of which the \u2018Nordic\u2019 family package, based on continuous, strong support for working parents, seems to be the most effective in promoting gender equality and female labour force participation and employment.",

In dynamic microsimulations, each individual in a given initial population is evolved through time according to estimated transition probabilities. Different life course events are simulated (for example educational choices, entry in the labour market, household formation and dissolution, fertility, evolution of work careers, retirement, death) with specific MSMs having a focus on different dimensions (for example demography, work, family, etc.) and different subgroups of the population. This has an impact on model specification: for instance, if the focus is on the elderly, issues like retirement choices and disability must be considered in greater detail, while if the focus is on women in fertile years, the former processes can be more vague, while more attention needs to be paid to modelling household composition and its interaction with the working career of mothers. Because of its centrality in life, most MSMs have a labour participation/employment module: see <a href=\"#ref61\">Li and O\u2019Donoghue (2013)</a> for a review. Some are fairly complex models which require years and relatively large teams to build, and that could in theory provide projections on labour force participation with the required focus on the interaction between family choices and career. However, because they have a different primary interest (say, pensions), they do not provide published results on female labour force participation at early stages of the life cycle.

In addition to improvements in model specification, the new model presented here provides a first example of a multi-country dynamic microsimulation: the structure of the model is the same for all countries considered, and simulations only differ because of country-specific inputs, in terms of representative population samples, estimates and parameters. This feature allows us to obtain results for several countries which are directly comparable in terms of the assumptions and modelling choices made; moreover, it allows running \u201cas if\u201d scenarios, where inputs from one country are tested on a different country (we do so in our companion paper <a href=\"#ref69\">Richardson, Pacelli, &amp; Richiardi, 2016</a>). These benefits are achieved, without excessively complicating the model, by leaving two highly institution-dependent processes in the background: income determination and retirement decisions. While these processes are often the prime object of investigation in dynamic MSMs, our focus on labour force participation and employment, and in particular on participation decisions of women in childbearing years, permits us to treat them at a higher level of abstraction, without compromising the quality of the projections. On the other hand, issues such as household composition and its effects on labour force participation of mothers are considered in detail. Finally, the model can be interpreted as a first step towards a more general model for all EU member states, similarly to what EUROMOD (<a href=\"#ref75\">Sutherland &amp; Figari, 2013</a>) provides for tax-benefit microsimulations.<sup><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup> In the next section we discuss in more details the pros and cons of the microsimulation approach with respect to what exists in the literature.",

Because each gender-age subgroup provides one unit of observation, the identification of the effects of each determinant can be obtained only by exploiting its variation over time.

Microsimulations allow an integrated assessment of the uncertainty surrounding the projections, based on the uncertainty of the underlying estimates for all the different processes that compose the model. On the other hand, uncertainty of the projections, even in the most sophisticated cohort models, can only come from the uncertainty surrounding the estimates of the single equation (for example participation). As this is generally not considered, uncertainty assessment in this type of models often boils down to running multiple scenarios about the exogenous evolution of the weights attributed to the different cells, but the choice of these scenarios, and their likelihood, remains outside the scope of the model. Unfortunately, uncertainty analysis is also generally neglected in dynamic microsimulation modelling, so that the advantages of an integrated assessment remain unexploited. An explicit and formal assessment of the uncertainty around our baseline projections is an innovative feature of our analysis. We elaborate on this point in <a href=\"#s7\">Section 7</a>.",

Fully accounting for UH is however complicated, especially when the available data have a short longitudinal component, as in the EU-SILC.

In each period, agents first go through the Demographic module, which deals with evolving the population structure by age, gender and area, based on Eurostat official demographic projections. Then, individuals above an individual-specific age threshold retire. Retired individuals remain in the simulation until they die but nothing else happens to them, except the ageing process. As in <a href=\"#ref70\">Richiardi and Poggi (2014)</a>, alignment of the population to the official statistics is made by randomly removing individuals from their age-gender cell when the concentration of the cell is higher than in the demographic projections for the specific year, or randomly cloning individuals when the concentration is lower. Students enter the Education module. If they remain in education, nothing else happens to them until the next period. If they exit education, they join the ranks of potentially active individuals. Females enter the Household composition module, where it is determined whether they form or remain in a union and whether they give birth to a child.

Distinguishing between the two hurdles, where the second hurdle is a model of differential employment over the business cycle and the first hurdle is a model of participation that abstracts from business cycles considerations is a good compromise, given that the effects of labour market conditions at the extensive margin are known to be smaller than those at the intensive margin (<a href=\"#ref6\">Attanasio, Levell, Low, &amp; S\u00e1nchez-Marcos, 2015</a>).<sup><a href=\"#fn15\">15</a></sup>",

In particular, sources of uncertainty are generally distinguished in (i) input data, for instance due to sampling errors in the initial population, (ii) model structure, that is the validity of the general modelling approach used (also called \u201cmethodological uncertainty\u201d), (iii) model specification, which concerns the choice of the covariates and the functional forms used, and in particular the crucial assumption that any regularity observed in the data will not break up in the future, (iv) model parameters, pointing to the imprecision of the estimates and/or externally provided parameters, and finally (v) Monte Carlo variation of the model output, which originates from the fact that the simulated aggregate quantities are also imprecise estimates of the theoretical aggregate quantities that the model implicitly defines. None of the above sources of uncertainty is generally considered in microsimulation studies, although this is recognised and criticised (see for instance <a href=\"#ref51\">Goedem\u00e9, Van den Bosch, Salanauskaite, &amp; Verbist, 2013</a>). However, \u201c[t]he calculation of confidence intervals around model results that account for all sources of error remains a major challenge\u201d (<a href=\"#ref63\">Mitton, Sutherland, &amp; Weeks, 2000</a>, p. 4).<sup><a href=\"#fn18\">18</a></sup>",

                    "text": "In our case, source (i) should be limited, due to the use of the sampling weights provided in the EU-SILC data. Sources (ii)\u2013(iii) are left unexplored, and we make the common assumption that the model is well specified. Measures of fit for each estimated equation are reported in Appendix A, and they are generally appropriate. Monte Carlo variation of the model outcome (source v) can be brought down to negligible by appropriately scaling up the simulated population size.<sup><a href=\"#fn19\">19</a></sup> The remaining source of uncertainty that needs to be addressed is therefore parameter uncertainty, stemming from sampling errors in estimation (source iv). There are two approaches that can be used to deal with this uncertainty (<a href=\"#ref23\">Creedy <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>). The first is what we might label \u201cbrute force\u201d and prescribes to bootstrap the coefficients of the estimated equations from a multivariate normal distribution (in the case of probit or multinomial probit regressions) with mean equal to the point estimate, and variance-covariance matrix equal to the estimated variance-covariance. Bootstrapping needs to be performed only once, at the beginning of the simulation: the entire simulation is then performed with the bootstrapped values of the coefficients. The second approach provides an approximation by assuming from the onset a normal distribution for the resulting confidence intervals, requiring many fewer draws from the parameter distribution. We follow the first approach and draw 1,000 sets of parameter values from their estimated multivariate distribution, for each country in the baseline scenario. Then, for every simulation time, we provide confidence intervals based on a kernel density estimation of the resulting distribution. The results, together with some additional remarks on the uncontrolled sources of uncertainty and the scope of the microsimulation exercise, will be presented in <a href=\"#s8-3\">Section 8.3</a>. Here, we only stress once again that the objective of dynamic microsimulation modelling is not forecasting per se, but rather the identification of the forces that are at work at the individual level, and the analysis of how these forces interact in shaping the particular societal outcome of interest. The projections should therefore be considered ceteris paribus exercises with respect to all the dynamics that are not explicitly modelled, and for which an assessment of the uncertainty must rely on external knowledge.",

Overall, the uncertainty coming from sampling errors in estimation is small, except for Greece and Ireland (about 10 ppt in the final year of the simulation). This should not however boost our confidence in the model results too much, as the assumption that no general equilibrium feedbacks will intervene to modify the regularities found in the estimation data becomes more and more unwarranted as we extend our out-of-sample projections into the future. Moreover, projections also abstract from unforeseen shocks, both at a micro-level (such as an unexpected surge in migration flows) and at a macro-level (such as the potential consequences of a breakdown of the Eurozone, or the shock waves caused by a hypothetical exit of a big member state, like the United Kingdom, from the EU), which also increase (in expectation) the uncertainty surrounding the model results as the forecasting horizon increases.",

Participation rates among the 20\u201344 years female population remain high and approximately similar also when disaggregating by region, education and family composition (Table B.1.3). In particular, there are few differences between the region with the highest participation rate (SE1, in 2013) and the region with the lowest rate (SE2, in 2013). Having children in Sweden does not place women at a disadvantage, as regards to participation (and employment). Also, only small differences are found between women with high education, and women with low education. These results reflect the exceptional approach of the Nordic countries regarding family support combined with diversity efforts. It is common and viewed positively when both parents care for their children and, accordingly, the government as well as employers have institutionalised numerous work-life balance programs combined with incentives for young families (<a href=\"#ref39\">European Commission, 2013a</a>). Part-time arrangements are well established in the Swedish business community as they go hand in hand with the extensive public benefits for young parents. Sweden was the first country to grant men and women equal access to paid parental leave in 1974. Parents are entitled to a total of 480 days paid leave per child, with both mothers and fathers entitled and encouraged to share the leave. This is paid at 80% of the salary (up to a ceiling) for 65 weeks, and at a flat rate for the remainder. However, because few men took parental leave, a non-transferable \u201cdaddy\u2019s month\u201d was introduced in 1995, extended to two months in 2002 (<a href=\"#ref5\">Addati, Cassirer, &amp; Gilchrist, 2014</a>). There are additional programs and incentives to promote a high quality of family life. Childcare access is universal and almost free of charge (<a href=\"#ref49\">Garcia-Moran, 2010</a>). The result is that 51% of children under the age of three and 95% of children between three and school age were enrolled in formal childcare (<a href=\"#ref40\">European Commission, 2013b</a>).",

Here, again, no significant regional differences are found. However, in this age group education makes a difference, with approximately a 15 ppt gap in participation rates between high and low educated females.

In particular, participation rates of mothers with young children are still very low (<a href=\"#ref25\">Del Boca, 2003</a>): more than a quarter of women leave the labour market after a birth (<a href=\"#ref17\">Bratti <i>et al</i>. 2005</a>; <a href=\"#ref20\">Casadio, Lo Conte, &amp; Neri, 2008</a>). Italian women often do not participate in the labour market as their role in the family limits their possibilities to pursue a career (<a href=\"#ref41\">European Commission, 2013c</a>). In fact, Italian women face a general cultural attitude against female labour force participation, a lack of part-time opportunities, a disproportionate share of the burden with respect to housework and child bearing within the family and an inadequate public childcare system. Concerning the enrolment in full-time childcare facilities (30 hours or more per week), Italy ranks above the EU average for children from zero to three years of age (17% vs. 15%), as well as for children from three years to school age (75% vs. 47%, see <a href=\"#ref42\">European Commission, 2013d</a>). However, the high cost of childcare services remains a problem. Moreover, the hours of childcare offered are typically incompatible with full-time jobs. As for what concerns children of school age, things do not improve much as school days often end in the mid-afternoon, much earlier than the end of fulltime workdays (<a href=\"#ref24\">Del Boca, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#ref27\">Del Boca &amp; Vuri, 2007</a>). This helps explain why the overall labour market participation of women in Italy still remains one of the lowest in Europe, with only 57.2% of active women in the 20\u201364 years age group in 2013, despite an increase in recent years. On the other hand, male participation is in line with the EU average (83% in 2013). This translates into a large gender gap (26 ppt).",

Our explanation points to another determinant of the low female participation rate in Italy, and how it interacts with family composition: low education. Italy has the lowest level of educational attainment among EU countries, and this affects female more than male labour force participation: the proportion of the population aged 30 to 34 with tertiary education in 2013 was 19% among males, and 29% among females, against an EU average of 34% and 42% respectively, and way behind the Europe 2020 target of 40% (the national target is 26%). This educational gap is even bigger when considering the whole population, due to the weight of older cohorts with lower levels of education (Table B.2.1). On aggregate, educational attainments in the model follow the external forecast: they are projected to grow but will remain low with respect to the EU average. However, the model predicts a change in the behaviour of young women, partly as a consequence of delayed marriage (Table B.2.2) which will force single women to be more active. In particular, the participation rate among young women with low education, both with and without children, is expected to increase significantly, leading to an overall increase in the participation rate in the 20\u201344 age group (Table B.2.3). This however will not be sufficient to outweigh the behaviour of older cohorts, leading to an overall female participation rate in Italy that is expected to remain the lowest in the countries under investigation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, panel b). Regional differences are also expected to remain large, notwithstanding a reduction in the gap between the highest and the lowest participation regions for younger cohorts (from 30 to 20 ppt, see Table B.2.3). Regional and educational differences in female participation rates are on the other hand projected to remain almost unchanged in the older cohorts (55\u201364 age group, Table B.2.4).",

A substantial part of this increase concerns the rise in the labour force participation rate of mothers (<a href=\"#ref16\">Borra, 2010</a>), and can be explained by an overall good level of family support, though this comes mainly in the form of child related benefits, while public childcare infrastructures for the age group from zero to three years old are still inadequate.<sup><a href=\"#fn23\">23</a></sup> This results in the common use of private childcare: over 20% of children under three and 50% of children between three and school age are enrolled full time (30 hours or more per week) in formal childcare (<a href=\"#ref36\">European Commission, 2012a</a>). Moreover, Spain provides for 16 weeks of fully paid maternity leave around childbirth, conditional on previous work experience; there are also legal entitlements to paternity leave (four weeks, fully paid) which often help mothers to get back to work (<a href=\"#ref16\">Borra, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#ref54\">Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, 2010</a>).",

Participation rates are predicted to remain fairly constant in Spain until 2030, and then slightly increase (about three ppt both for males and females) between 2030 and 2050 (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, panels a-b, and Table B.3.1).

Consequently, the predicted increase in participation rates is entirely explained by composition effects, and in particular by demographic change.

However, regional and educational differences are expected to persist over time (Table B.4.3), while educational differences in participation rates for the elderly female population are likely to widen, due to a sharp increase in the attachment to the labour force of more educated women (Table B.4.4). This has to be evaluated taking into consideration that female labour force participation among elderly women in Greece is one of the lowest rates in Europe, with family reasons being cited as the most likely factor associated with inactivity. In fact, previous breaks in working life resulting in fewer career options later on, combined with lack of care facilities can push senior females out of the labour market to provide care for grandchildren or older family members.",

In Hungary, work disincentives predominantly arise from the design of extended paid parental leave, in a context of a shortage of affordable childcare (<a href=\"#ref56\">Jenker, 2015</a>). Parents can take up to three years of leave, and the overwhelming share of caregivers are women (<a href=\"#ref59\">Korintus &amp; G\u00e1bos 2014</a>). Benefits are entitled to mothers of young children staying at home: maternity leave and the insurance-based childcare benefit can only be taken until the child\u2019s first birthday; and a mother receiving these benefits cannot work. Extended leave periods (beyond 24 months) tend to negatively impact female participation by weakening mothers\u2019 attachment to the labour market and putting them at a disadvantage from a prospective employer\u2019s point of view (European Commission, 2014b). This is particularly true for women with a low education, who tend to remain out of the labour force even when their children grow up. Finally, Hungary also has a significantly lower part-time rate for women than the EU average: women in Hungary tend to work full-time or not at all (<a href=\"#ref38\">European Commission, 2012c</a>).",

This means that at each simulated time (for example, 2022) the simulated population is partitioned by gender and age. The size of each resulting cell is then compared to the Eurostat projections<sup><a href=\"#fn27\">3</a></sup>: if in a given cell there are too many simulated individuals, those in excess (randomly selected) are removed from the simulated population; if on the other hand there are too few simulated individuals, an appropriate number of randomly selected simulated individuals are cloned and added to the simulation. This also takes care of migration, under the assumption that (i) those who move out of the country do not self-select, and are on average similar, given their age and gender, to those who do not emigrate, and (ii) immigrants immediately become similar to those already living in the destination region. This is a simplifying assumption and is motivated by the fact that projections on migration flows are not easily available. Also, internal mobility within regions is not modelled, again because demographic projections at a regional level are not available from Eurostat. Because cell resizing (that is removing and cloning) is done randomly, this implicitly assumes that the distribution of the population between different regions remains constant. Hence, any internal migration flow (for instance between the South and the North of Italy) is assumed to be persistent (constant over the years), so that what we observe in the data, and keep constant throughout the simulation, is an equilibrium distribution.",

The specification controls for three policy parameters: the amount of regional childcare spending per child, the amount of parental leave benefits (expressed in % of GDP), and the availability of part-time jobs. On leave benefits are regulated by a national law, and we can safely assume that they are exogenous (data come from the OECD Family database). As for childcare, we use a measure of public provision of childcare, which under the hypothesis that policy makers respond only sluggishly to changes in the demand for childcare, can also be considered as exogenous. The data we use also come from the OECD Family database, and are available only at the national level. Finally, we use the share of part-time work among women in the 18\u201345 years age range in the region as a proxy of the availability of part-time opportunities. Under the assumption that use of part-time labour in firms is mainly driven by social norms and managerial culture, this is also exogenous.",

The alternative is having a fully-fledged microfounded demographic module, which is outside of the scope of the present model. To get around this problem in a simple way, we allow flags to be switched on when a new baby is born, without new individuals actually entering the simulated population. The model can then be run either by aligning the number of flags switched on to the number of new babies born each year according to the official demographic projections, which ensures internal consistency of the model at the cost of treating fertility rates as exogenous, or without alignment \u2014 that is, allowing women to have more children than the numbers predicted by the official projections. This feature will be exploited in the policy experiments of our companion paper (<a href=\"#ref83\">Richardson, Pacelli, &amp; Richiardi, 2016</a>).",

The specification for females with very young children (0\u20133 years old) closely resembles that for maternity, without the fertility rate and with the addition of a 0\u20131 indicator for the crisis (year 2009 and beyond). In the simulations, the coefficient of this variable is a scenario parameter to model the dynamics of the recovery. As a default, it is decreased linearly up to 2020 (2030 for Greece), when we assume that the effects of the crisis will be over. The specification for females with children aged 4\u201312 years old does not include the family related policy variables (childcare expenditure and on-leave benefits), but still includes the availability of part time work. The specification for women without children or with older children also does not include the availability of part-time work. The model is estimated on pooled data for all countries, with country interactions introduced when appropriate (this explains why some coefficients are equal for all countries, while other differ). <a href=\"#tableA-5-2-1\">Tables A.5.2.1</a>-<a href=\"#tableA-5-2-3\">A.5.2.3</a> report the estimation results.

Because the microsimulation is a model of labour supply rather than labour demand, the aggregate unemployment rate (which is the result of the interaction between labour supply and labour demand) is aligned to a scenario parameter, which is allowed to vary over time: as a default value, it is considered that the overall unemployment rate will linearly decrease to its pre-crisis level (computed as the average unemployment rate in the 2005\u20132007 period). The overall unemployment rate also enters the equation as a control variable, making the employment process a model of differential employment (analogous to the maternity process).
