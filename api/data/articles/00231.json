As standard in the literature, \u2018static\u2019 means that both the population and the behaviours of the population are kept fixed when analysing the effects of policies. The model thus computes only the arithmetic, deterministic (\u201cmorning after\u201d) effect of policies on the input population - even if this is sometimes subject to randomness, for instance when it comes to modelling take-up rates or nowcasting. The model can however be used to compute first-order approximations of behavioural effects through changes to incentives to work (e.g. marginal tax rates) and as input for labour supply models to assess changes in employment due to policy changes, as well as combined with dynamic models to study the longer term effects of policies.",

They produce comparable results, although comparison is hindered by the fact that the other models are not publicly accessible and publicly documented and validated. The main difference is that UKMOD is an academic rather than a government or business project. It aims to be widely used and discussed, and puts accessibility as a top priority for achieving this: we release the model open source and free of charge, together with a thorough documentation. The model maintains all the flexibility of EUROMOD \u2013 policy scenarios can be created by implementing not only parametric changes, but also more structural reforms \u2013 and benefits from existing EUROMOD tools and add-ons (Policy Effect Tool, Hypothetical Household Tool, Statistics Presenter, In-depth Analysis, Marginal Tax Rates) that facilitate scenario analysis.

While respondents are interviewed throughout the year in both FRS and EU-SILC data, EU-SILC respondents are asked about <i>income in previous calendar year</i> (that is, January to December before the interview), irrespective of the source, while FRS respondents are asked about <i>current income</i>. With regard to income from benefits, FRS respondents provide figures which relate most commonly to the last week, the last two weeks or the last month. As for earnings, employees are asked about the latest salary payment, and the self-employed about annual profits from the most recent tax returns. For income from investment and employee non-cash income, respondents report their most recent annual or half-yearly income that they received from this source. All income is then annualised.",

Taking a snapshot of income rather than measuring the inflow over a longer period of time has important consequences, as the instantaneous measure is by construction more volatile than the cumulated measure (which is basically a mean).<sup><a href=\"#fn7\">7</a></sup> This implies, for instance, that inequality measured on instantaneous income (or \u201ccross-sectional\u201d inequality) is on average higher than inequality measured on cumulated income (or \u201clongitudinal\u201d inequality).<sup><a href=\"#fn8\">8</a></sup> It also implies that taxes and benefits (when means tested) are measured only approximately, as they are generally computed based on yearly incomes.<sup><a href=\"#fn9\">9</a></sup> The measure available in the FRS, which is the standard measure of inequality reported in the official statistics and used by the Government, is a hybrid between the two, being computed both on dependent and self-employment incomes. However, it is more skewed towards cross-sectional inequality, given the prevalence of employees over self-employed (approximately 27 million vs. 5 million, or 5.5 employees for every self-employed). Using data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), a precursor to the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), <a href=\"#bib1\">B\u00f6nheim and Jenkins (2006)</a> show that estimates of cross-sectional and longitudinal income distribution summary statistics, computed on current and annual income respectively, are remarkably similar. They explain this finding partly with the fact that some income sources classified as \u2018current income\u2019 refer to usual income rather than the most recent income, and partly with the fact that within-year income volatility appears to be low for most individuals. <a href=\"#bib7\">Jenkins (2010)</a> concludes that the distinction between measures of current and annual income is unimportant relative to other issues, at least in BHPS data. Whether this result holds true for FRS data as well, and for more recent years, is however an open question (<a href=\"#bib15\">Tomlinson, 2018</a>, shows that monthly income volatility is far from negligible in the UK).",
