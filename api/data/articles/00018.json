                "text": "The Australian Government is seeking to encourage older workers to remain in the labour force longer to overcome future labour shortages and ensure adequate taxation revenue to fund the needs of an ageing population. Longer labour force participation also has benefits to individuals in terms of available income and capacity to save for a better standard of living in retirement. While the Government recognises that not all older workers are able to participate in the labour force, there is little information on what health conditions keep people from working, or what the costs are to the government or the individual. This case study outlines how a new microsimulation model, Health&WealthMOD, is being designed to fill this information gap by estimating the economic impacts of illness. The general approach adopted is outlined, following which two early applications of the model are presented. The model is used to explore the determinants of the duration spent in retirement and to generate projections of retirement due to illness to 2020.",

There are a range of options explored in more detail elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib12\">Schofield <i>et al</i>., 1996</a>), however statistical imputation has the greatest advantages in capturing the relationship between important characteristics and imputation variables. So for example, to impute private income on to the Health&amp;WealthMOD base population from STINMOD, a regression equation will be estimated using variables in common with Health&amp;WealthMOD base population such as age, sex, marital status, family type, spouse characteristics and education. However, because income does not remain constant from age 45 to 65, income at each age will need to be imputed to capture the total loss from retirement to age 65. This process will be undertaken for each variable to be imputed including private and other income sources, income taxation, each Centrelink benefit type, wealth accumulated through superannuation and other asset classes and future superannuation and other income streams.",

However, this could lead to a significant overestimate as early retirement may also occur for reasons other than ill health and should thereby reduce the total period of retirement resulting from ill health. To take these reasons into account we will estimate the probability of retirement or unemployment for all persons other than those who have retired as a result of ill health by age and sex. This probability will be used to estimate the probability that each person who retired due to ill health would have subsequently retired for other reasons for each year from the reported retirement age to age 65.",

The attributable risk of being out of the labour force associated with long term health conditions was estimated for each condition (<a href=\"#bib14\">Schofield <i>et al</i>., 2008</a>). Analysis of the Health&amp;WealthMOD base population was then undertaken, supplemented by this risk information and ABS population projections. In order to distinguish between the effects of conditions that primarily impact on the oldest workers (such as heart disease), and those which have a high prevalence amongst younger workers with generally high employment rates (such as mental illness), it was assumed that without the long term condition person might have achieved the labour force participation of their 5-year age and sex cohort.",

In summary, it was projected that ageing of the population and trends in disease prevalence would lead to a rise of approximately 609,000 people out of the labour force due to chronic illness by 2020. This represents a near doubling of the number of people and an increase of 50% in the proportion of people not employed due to ill health. While ageing was expected to produce a net increase of around 205,500 non labour force participants, trends in chronic illness were anticipated to have a considerably greater effect. As a result the model was found to be more sensitive to alterations in health trends than to those for demographic assumptions.",
