                "text": "The timing of partnership formation in closed continuous-time microsimulation models poses difficulties due to the continuous time scale. in this paper the problem is resolved by the concept of a partnership market, which individuals can enter and leave at any point in time over the complete simulation time range. Each individual, who looks for a spouse, remains in the market for a specific period during which searching and matching is performed. To build up synthetic couples, the model imitates a decision making-process. The decision to enter a partnership depends on empirically estimated logit models for the probability that a given woman and a given man will get together, and also on an individual aspiration level regarding a potential partner. A couple is formed if a positive decision has been made and the timing of the partnership formation is consistent with the individual searching periods of the prospective spouses. The algorithm is illustrated by an example in which simulations are run to project a synthetic population, similar to the population of the Netherlands, by using an extended version of the microsimulation tool of the MicMac project.",

That is, a realistic description of life-course dynamics necessitates the consideration of \u201clinked lives\u201d (<a href=\"#bib11\">Elder et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Huinink and Feldhaus, 2009</a>). People cohabit or marry, have children and live in families, and this environment has an impact on their demographic behaviour. it implies that some individual demographic events require that other individuals are linked to a person, and that the relationship between linked individuals may modify their future behaviour, i.e., the behavioural model describing their life courses. For example, in the majority of cases, the decision to have children depends not only on the woman, but also on the potential father and, presumably, additionally on the social network of each (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bernardi, 2003</a>). In a microsimulation, life course events are commonly determined based on empirical distribution functions that rely on data reported for single persons. Individual interaction patterns, like partnership relations and kinship, are often neglected in this context (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ruggles, 1993</a>). This paper investigates one particular problem that arises when including linked lives into a continuous-time microsimulation model: it addresses the onset of partnership (cohabitation or marriage) and the matching of proper mates in continuous time.",

The central unit of a demographic microsimulation model is the individual life course, which is characterized by a sequence of demographic events such as birth, marriage, childbirth, divorce, retirement, and death, and the time spans between these events.",

                    "text": "In demographic microsimulations, life courses usually evolve along two time scales: individual age and calendar time. A possible third time scale is the time that an individual has already spent in his/her current demographic state, e.g., the time that has elapsed since the individual\u2019s wedding. All time scales can either be discrete (usually in units of years) or continuous (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wolf, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Galler, 1997</a>). In discrete-time models, time advances in discrete steps (commonly in years or months), i.e., the time axis is discretized. At each step, individual attributes and behaviour are updated. In contrast, a continuous-time microsimulation model features a continuous time scale along which events occur, i.e., an event can occur at any instant in time. Generally, for a precise description of population dynamics, continuous-time models are the optimal theoretical choice as a continuous approach most closely mirrors life course development (<a href=\"#bib39\">Willekens, 2009</a>). Furthermore, compared to a discrete-time microsimulation, the processing of a continuoustime microsimulation can be very efficient (<a href=\"#bib33\">Satyabudhi &amp; Onggo, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">van Imhoff &amp; Post, 1998</a>). This is because, in a continuous-time microsimulation, individual attributes are only updated when an event occurs. However, continuous-time microsimulations pose some problems when forming relationships that discrete-time models can avoid (<a href=\"#bib37\">van Imhoff &amp; Post, 1998</a>). In discrete-time models, it is convenient to construct mating pools at equidistant time points, e.g., for every year. During simulation, individuals enter these mating pools and undergo mate-matching. In continuous-time models, events occur at exact time points and, in practice, individuals will never experience partnership events at the same time. Therefore, a pool of potential partners cannot as easily be constructed as in discrete time models.",

                    "text": "Nevertheless, a common way to establish partnership markets in continuous-time models is to use open mating models. In this class of models, spouses are created as new individuals when needed, rather than selected from already existing members of the population. The main problem of open mating models is their interpretation: it is not realistic to pull an appropriate spouse \u201cout of the hat\u201d when needed. A more realistic way to model mating instead is to use a closed mating model. Here, appropriate spouses are identified from the current members of a population. To ensure that a closed mating model resembles observed mating patterns, it has to be applied to a large enough share of an entire population. Up to now, closed mating models have only been used in the context of discrete-time microsimulation. A reason might be that in continuous-time models the probability that two events will happen at exactly the same time point is zero and thus practically individuals will never experience partnership events at the same time. As a consequence, in a continuous-time model, a pool of potential partners is hard to identify.",

As soon as an individual starts to look for a spouse, he/she becomes part of the market and stays there until mate-matching is finished. To match individuals, an algorithm is needed to determine appropriate partners: Who should be linked to whom? Humans mate assortatively (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blossfeld &amp; Timm, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kalmijn, 1998</a>); that is, partners are not chosen randomly but are selected according to preferences. Typically, spouses are similar with respect to certain attributes, and synthetic couples should reflect this habit. Accordingly, a two-fold approach is suggested to build up synthetic couples: First, to each individual a random value is assigned that captures his/her aspiration level regarding a partner. An empirical likelihood equation reveals the probability that a given woman and a given man form a couple. Subsequently, a decision-making process is simulated as to whether two individuals mate, applying individuals' aspiration levels and their matching probability.",

The idea is to inspect existing closed mating models to whether they can be adopted to also work in continuous time. In discrete-time models, assigning individuals to a mating pool proceeds generally as follows: In a discrete-time microsimulation model, time changes in discrete steps. After each step, all individuals of the model population are inspected as to whether they will experience an event during the next interval and, if so, which event this will be. In case an individual is scheduled to experience the onset of a partnership, he/she is marked as searching for a spouse. At each time step, after every member of the population has been inspected, all searching individuals are collected in a partnership market. That is, \u201ca partnership market\u201d is a construct used to pool all those individuals who are looking for a spouse. As a partnership market allows collecting all eligible partners, its construction in any case is deemed useful also in a continuous-time setting.",

Both questions concern the mating rules that are applied to match individuals.

Stable mating rules aim at producing a set of stable matings (see also the \u201cstable marriage problem\u201d in <a href=\"#bib13\">Gale and Shapley (1962)</a>). Stochastic mating rules use stochastic experiments to decide on the success of potential pairings. All mating rules make use of a compatibility measure to determine the quality of a match. The pros and cons of stable mating rules have been discussed extensively by <a href=\"#bib5\">Bouffard et al. (2001)</a> and <a href=\"#bib26\">Leblanc et al.

In a female-dominant mate-matching algorithm, the roles of women and men are simply reversed: Women choose from a list of potential spouses (see e.g., <a href=\"#bib17\">Hammel et al. (1976</a>, ch. 9) and <a href=\"#bib24\">Kelly (2003)</a>). In a mixed-dominant mate-matching procedure, both sexes are treated equally.

This individual then randomly chooses his/her actual spouse from the opposite-sex candidates with the highest compatibility (<a href=\"#bib38\">Wachter, 1995</a>). In contrast, in the second variant, initially the compatibility measure between all potential pairings is determined, and then couples are constructed.

That is, life courses can be constructed as sequences of waiting times to next events (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gampe &amp; Zinn, 2007</a>). As a direct consequence, partnership formation times are already known in advance. This knowledge is used when constructing a partnership market for a continuous-time microsimulation: an individual is determined to enter the partnership market at the moment when the waiting time to a partnership formation event starts. That is, as soon as a marriage or cohabitation event has been simulated, an individual joins this market. To be able to explain this circumstance better, consider the following example: Simulation starts at time <i>t<sub>s</sub></i> when a woman is <i>a</i><sub>0</sub> years old. She has never been married and is childless at this time. Conditional on her current state, her age, and the current calendar time, a waiting time of <i>w</i> = 3.6 years to a marriage event is simulated.

Therefore, besides event times, individual characteristics also have to be checked for conformance. For this purpose, a compatibility measure is used such as introduced in <a href=\"#s2-1\">Section 2.1</a>. As distance functions measure the quality of pairings very simplistically, logit models are employed to evaluate how well the characteristics of potential spouses agree. Which covariates will enter the logit models depends on the state space of the actual application. In this paper a generic microsimulation model is assumed; i.e., the state space is not fixed. Only individual age and sex are mandatory attributes. Depending on the problem to be studied, different relevant demographic states will be considered. Obviously, only those covariates can be included in the logit models that are in the state space. If, for example, educational attainment, children ever born, or ethnicity are included in the state space, these attributes are natural candidates for covariates in the logit models. For a pair of individuals, the compatibility measure gives, conditioned on the considered attributes, the probability of a union.",

Thus mate-seekers are satisficing (<a href=\"#bib34\">Simon, 1990</a>): different candidates are inspected until one is found that \u201cmeets the expectation\". In the proposed algorithm, individuals reduce their aspiration level by <i>\u03b4<sub>A</sub></i>,<i>\u03b4<sub>A</sub></i> \u2208 [0,1], every time they are involved in an unsuccessful encounter. This way their chance to find a mate the next time is increased. The reduction of the aspiration level with each rejection corresponds to a strategy proposed by <a href=\"#bib3\">Billari (2000)</a> and <a href=\"#bib35\">Todd et al. (2005)</a>. They suggest using individual aspiration-based heuristics to model human mate-choice processes. The basic idea is that if the traits of a potential spouse meet or exceed an individual\u2019s aspiration level, a partnership is formed. Aspiration levels are adjusted according to offers and rejections received by others. Here this approach is adapted by reducing the aspiration levels of individuals who date but reject each other.",

Based on the theory of initial parental investment, women are assumed to be \u201cchoosier\u201d than men concerning their partners (<a href=\"#bib36\">Trivers, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Buss, 2006</a>). However, the degree of \u201cchoosiness\u201d of females and males varies with age. Women tend to decrease their requirements with declining fecundity. When they are in their early thirties, they are less demanding than at younger ages. For single women older than 35, the \u201cticking of the biological clock\u201d even leads to a considerably increased effort to date men (<a href=\"#bib29\">Pawlowskia &amp; Dunbar, 1999</a>). While after age 40, women tend to be more \u201cchoosy\u201d again (<a href=\"#bib12\">French &amp; Kus, 2008</a>). Although socio-economic factors play a role in this context, too, only the age trajectory is considered here. Men, however, behave differently. When they are young, men are more involved in short-term relationships, and therefore are more interested in the number of sexual partners, not so much in the quality of a relationship (<a href=\"#bib6\">Buss, 2006</a>). As a consequence, they are less selective concerning the traits of a partner. However, when men start to look for long-term relationships, willing to establish a family and to invest in offspring, their behavior changes, and their level of \u201cchoosiness\u201d increases. In this approach, 30 is selected as the age when men start to intensively look for a long-term spouse. To account for the variability in the degree of aspiration, the beta distribution is parameterized accordingly. The parameter values of the beta-distribution are gender-specific and vary with age (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).",

Therefore, the computation of the entry of an individual into the searching and mating phase relies on observed behavior. The mate-matching procedure proposed here mimics human mating as a decision process. That is, matches that are created during simulation are the outcome of intended behavior. Consequently, not all individuals who engage a mate search phase during simulation will find a partner. Reasons for this are competition with others or simply a short supply of spouses with compatible characteristics. In other words, the presented mate-matching algorithm does not guarantee that each searching individual (i.e., each individual who is part of the partnership market and therefore an element of the marriage queue) will be paired. Mate-matching fails if an individual is not able to find within his/her searching period a spouse with compatible characteristics. In order to be successful, each seeker has to have access to a rich enough pool of potential spouses. This can only be assured if the model population maps a large proportion of an actual population.",

To accurately estimate a retrospective regression model, case and control sampling fractions have to be consisted. However, in the present setting such data were not available because it cannot be observed who in reality did not mate. To add information about controls nonetheless, for each observed couple a synthetic couple was built by randomly assigning to each male spouse a female who was not his observed partner. The response variable was set to one in the case a couple had been observed. Otherwise, the response variable was set to zero. Unfortunately, conducting mate-matching requires a prospective design: to measure the compatibility of a pairing, the likelihood that two individuals with certain attributes mate is needed. A mandatory condition of a prospective model is that case and control fractions are made up by the source population, i.e., the sampling has to be random. In this mate-matching procedure, compatibility between two potential spouses is measured on a relative scale, depending only on the attributes of two individuals, and not on the composition of the pool of available candidates. Therefore, for present purposes the estimation of a prospective logit model is suitable (see also <a href=\"#bib31\">Prentice and Pyke (1979)</a>).",

In all models, a positive effect can be observed if the male was higher/equally educated than/as the female. Generally, no significant effect of the marriage history on the mating propensity of the male can be detected. However, the results indicate that, when they married or cohabitated for the first time, men were more prone to mate women who had not been married before. Women and men who mated were more likely to be of the same age. The effect is stronger in the case of firstorder marriages and cohabitations. In all four models, the direct effect of the age of the male is very small. Modeling compatibility by partnership order might be a reason for this phenomenon. First partnerships are usually started at younger ages, while higher order partnerships follow later in life. Therefore, a man\u2019s age at partnership onset is already indirectly described by the partnership type. In the analysis, men had a higher probability to undergo a higher order cohabitation with a female who had already had children with former partners. Surprisingly, for the other partnership types, no significant effects of the presence of children with former partners on a male\u2019s mating probability could be observed.",

Besides basic validation of the simulation output, important hints for model improvement can be gained from careful analysis of the results. During the mate-matching process several simplifying assumptions were made, e.g., shifting event times, and these may have an undue impact. A very basic validation step is the re-estimation of the empirical transition rates which were used as input, by occurrence-exposure rates (<a href=\"#bib23\">Keiding, 1990</a>). To smooth these rates, a two-dimensional P-splines technique was employed (<a href=\"#bib8\">Currie et al., 2006</a>) that has been implemented in an R package named MortalitySmooth (<a href=\"#bib7\">Camarda, 2009</a>). The re-estimation of rates shows that a simulation with mate-matching causes consistent output. Some results are plotted in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>. Both figures are level plots<a href=\"#fn4\"><sup>4</sup></a>. Empirical rates along with reestimated rates are presented. Rates are given along calendar time and age. Their values are depicted on a \u201crainbow\u201d color scale: red areas correspond to very low rates and violet-pink areas correspond to high rates. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> shows transition rates of childless women with a lower secondary (medium) education who experience a transition from \u201cbeing single after leaving parental home\u201d to \u201cfirst cohabitation\u201d. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> depicts transition rates of highly educated males who experience a transition from \u201cbeing single after leaving parental home\u201d to \u201cfirst marriage\". During simulation both sets of transition rates varied along age but were held constant over calendar time. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> reveals that, for women with a lower secondary education, empirical and reestimated marriage rates are almost identical, i.e., here the proposed mate-matching procedure does not significantly change the output of the simulation model.",

In summary, the results obtained mean that the re-estimation of the transition rates confirms the general suitability of the proposed mate-matching procedure.",

                                    "text": "Analyzing the simulated partnership market over time is a way to reveal whether its dynamics resembles human mating behavior. In particular, the composition and the development of the pool of unsuccessful seekers is of interest. During the simulation, 40,585 partnership formations were performed, 19,050 due to marriage and 21,535 due to cohabitation. Thus, 8,170 individuals successfully entered and left the partnership market. Because the algorithm could not find a proper spouse in time, the searching period of approximately ten percent of all seekers had to be extended. Over 17 years of simulation, 5,397 individuals had entered the market without finding a spouse. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> displays the age distribution of unsuccessful seekers according to the year when they had entered the partnership market. Individuals who initialized a partner search at older ages remained more often unpaired than their younger counterparts. This phenomenon occurred because during simulation the synthetic mating pool for individuals at older ages was not as rich as it was for younger persons. Consequently, for older individuals the chance of finding an appropriate spouse was relatively small. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> also shows that the age distribution of unsuccessful seekers did not significantly change over the simulation horizon. These findings were contrasted with the number of unsuccessful seekers along the year (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). A decline along calendar time is obvious. In summary, along calendar time the number of unsuccessful seekers decreased, but the age distribution of unsuccessful seekers remained stable. This phenomenon is caused by the age structure of the model population. Generally, at older ages only a small proportion of individuals enters the partnership market. As the model population ages during simulation, over time the number of mature adults who enter the market however goes up. Therefore, for them the chance of finding an assortative mate increases, and in the synthetic pool the number of aged individuals who remain unpaired shrinks. But still, compared to younger seekers, the mating pool of older adults is reduced, e.g., due to mortality or a high proportion of married persons at the same age. Decreasing the aspiration level of elderly people is an option to increase their chance to find a partner. However, this also means to allow constructing non-assortative matches, and thus building couples whose attributes do not resemble the attributes of observed couples \u2013 a property a mate-matching procedure should guarantee. That is, decreasing the aspiration level of elderly people impairs the proposed mate-matching strategy rather than to improve it.",

Therefore, as a further validation step, the distribution of joint characteristics was analyzed, with a special emphasis on differences in educational attainment and age. The differences in the educational level of synthetic couples were compared to those of couples given in the NKPS (in the range from 1990 to 2002). <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> contrasts simulated and actual data concerning the educational level within married couples (upper graph) and cohabiting couples (lower graph). Two types of couples are differentiated: couples in which the man is higher educated than the woman and couples in which both partners are equally educated. To account for eventual age effects, couples are additionally differentiated according to the man\u2019s age at partnership onset: couples were considered where the man was younger than 30 years, couples where he was between 30 and 40 years old, and couples where he was older than 40 years. All presented numbers are given relative to the total number of couples in each age category. That is, the proportion of couples in which the woman is higher educated than the man can easily be derived by subtracting the numbers given for each age category from one. For married couples, comparing simulated and actual data shows a difference of maximal nine percentage points (in the category \u201ccouple in which the woman is higher educated than the man and the man has married younger than 30\u201d). For cohabiting couples, the maximal difference between simulated and actual couples is seven percentage points (in the category \u201ccouple in which the woman is higher educated than the man and the man has married when he was between 30 and 40 years old\u201d). overall, in the considered categorization the relative numbers of simulated and actual couples differ only slightly. This result shows that the simulation satisfactorily captures the overall pattern of differences in the educational level of spouses.",

The effect should be most pronounced at ages neighbouring the age group with the surplus of single men (relative competition). At the same time, the number of partnered women should increase over all ages. To check whether the present mate-matching procedure can handle such a situation, in the initial population the number of single men aged 27 was doubled. A comparison of the partnerships built under the initial and the modified setting shows that the proposed mate-matching procedures copes well when strong competition is present. In the cohort of men who turn 28 in 2004, an increased number of partnered men could be observed, but the number did not double as compared to the initial setting. Because of the surplus of younger rivals, the number of partnered men older than 28 declined. The effect is strongest in the neighbourhood of age 28 \u2013 which attests that the matching algorithm is able to handle situations of relative competition. For ages lower than 26, the number of partnered men is nearly identical to the initial setting. In this model the conditions, whether a female enters the partnership market or not, depends on her personal propensity and not on the availability of men. Therefore, even with a surplus of men in the mating pool, the number of partnered females remains stable.",

A small value of <i>\u03b4<sub>A</sub></i>, like 0.01, meant that mate-seekers did not adequately adjust their aspiration according to the supply of potential spouses in the partnership market. Hence, mate-seekers were too \u201cchoosy\u201d, and during simulation a large proportion of mate-seekers stayed unpaired. In contrast, setting <i>\u03b4<sub>A</sub></i> to a relatively large value, like 0.5, caused mate-seekers who are not very discriminating regarding their conformance with potential spouses. As a consequence, simulated couple characteristics considerably differed from actual characteristics of partners in couples.

In open models, an appropriate partner is created when needed. By contrast, in closed models an appropriate partner has to be found among the individuals of the model population. In terms of modeling and simulation, open models are straightforward; however, their interpretation is difficult. How can the appearance of a spouse be explained that was not present before? Closed models have a more plausible interpretation as marital matches are formed between individuals that already exist. Corresponding modeling and simulation approaches have to incorporate sophisticated matching algorithms that ensure the creation of synthetic marriages that follow a realistic pattern. Several suitable matching algorithms exist, but all of them apply to discrete-time models. No matching algorithm has so far been proposed for closed microsimulation models with a continuous-time scale. In discrete-time models, annual marriage markets are applied to create couples. This is a natural choice as in discrete-time models events are determined to occur in a given year. In continuous-time models by contrast, where events can occur at any point in time, annual marriage markets do not fit (see <a href=\"#s3-2\">Section 3.2</a>).",

In a continuous-time microsimulation, individual life courses are specified as sequences of waiting times to a next event. That is, the time point when individuals will experience the onset of a marriage or a cohabitation can be determined in advance. In the present mate-matching procedure, the waiting time until marriage or cohabitation onset is used for scanning potential partners. At the moment the simulation triggers for an individual as next event a marriage or a cohabitation event (i.e., when an individual\u2019s wait for a partnership event starts), the individual enters a partnership market. Here, each \u201cmating-minded\u201d individual remains for a specific period of mate-searching and matching. In the market, the individual meets a limited number of potential partners at random. Each simulated individual exhibits a certain level of aspiration concerning attributes of potential spouses. To build synthetic couples, a decisionmaking process is simulated as to whether two individuals date each other by applying the individuals' aspiration levels and their mating probability. (Relying on the theory of assortative mating, pairs with similar attributes, like similar ages and educational levels, have a higher probability of mating.) A couple is formed if a positive decision has been made and the timing of the couple\u2019s partnership formation events is consistent regarding their individual searching periods. Individuals that were inspected, but rejected, lower their level of aspiration accordingly. A marriage queue is used to implement the partnership market as basis for the matching procedure.",

A seeker might generally suffer from an exploited partner market, and his/her searching period is thus extended over and over again. Such shifts of event time mean ignoring already generated events and are in conflict with the stochastic model used for simulating life course events. In summary, empirical and re-estimated rates were not remarkably different.

Currently, the quality of a match has no effect on the stability of the union. However, the inclusion of quality seems natural. Furthermore, in the current model, individuals enter the partnership market based on empirical marriage rates or based on rates indicating cohabitation propensities. To correctly determine partnership events, however, instead of marriage or cohabitation rates, rates indicating the willingness to mate would have to be used. One way to obtain those rates would be to hypothesize them based on external knowledge of the phenomenon. Pairing individuals generally raises problems concerning the modeling and simulation of linked lives. An abstract DEVS (Discrete Event Specification Language)-based model to establish and simulate linked lives in continuous-time is currently under examination.",

The Netherlands Kinship Panel Study is funded by grant 480-10-009 from the Major Investments Fund of the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), and by the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (NIDI), Utrecht University, the University of Amsterdam, and Tilburg University. This paper would never have been written without the help of several persons: Particular thanks go to Jutta Gampe for her fruitful supervision. Adelinde Uhrmacher and Frans Willekens volunteered to read several versions of the paper, and their comments significantly improved the quality of the paper. The input data files for the microsimulation example were prepared by Ekaterina Ogurtsova. Jim Oeppen helped with general advice. Basic ideas of mate-matching in continuous time go back to discussions with Jan Himmelspach and Frans Willekens. Nico Keilman provided very helpful comments on the last draft version of this paper.",
