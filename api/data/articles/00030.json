To asses the effects of both on income distribution poverty levels, a bottom-up general equilibrium model of Brazil (TERM-BR) is linked to a microsimulation model. It is shown that one of the favoured policies is more poverty reducing, the other more income inequality reducing. Perhaps even more importantly, the analysis demonstrates that the two policies lead to very different outcomes in terms of inter-state transfers; a major political barrier to reform in a federal state.",

In the last eleven years the debate upon this theme increased, due to the frequent diagnostics pointing to the inefficiency of the Brazilian tax system, mainly the indirect tax system. Since then the need of a broad reform has been recognized by the society, even though there is no general agreement about how to do this reform. As a consequence of that, since the 1990 decade many different proposals were sent to the congress.<a href=\"#fn1\"><sup>1</sup></a> The main point on the debate about the Brazilian indirect tax system reform has been the centred on economic efficiency issues, as well as in its regional impacts, with less attention being paid to the welfare and distributive effects.<a href=\"#fn2\"><sup>2</sup></a> These effects, however, can be important, since the indirect tax affect not only consumption, but also employment, through its effect on economic activity. In empirical studies the potential regional effects of changes in the tax system and other distributive effects have seldom been considered. In this respect it is evident the lack of formal analytical instruments for the analysis. The objective of this paper is to address the potential distributive impacts of changes in the Brazilian indirect tax system, through the simulation of two different indirect tax policies scenarios, with the aid of a general equilibrium and micro-simulation model tailored for distributional analysis. The reference year for the analysis is 2001.",

Data from the Brazilian National Accounting System show that the total tax burden in Brazil mounted to 33.4% of GDP in 2001. From this total, 68.06% was appropriated by the federal government, 27.48% by the states, and 4.46% by the municipal governments. The share of indirect taxes in the total tax burden in the Brazilian economy in 2001 was 69.85%, while direct taxes accounted for 30.15%. These numbers highlight the importance of indirect taxes on the Brazilian economy. The main indirect tax is the ICMS, a state value added tax, which accounts for 23.45% of total tax burden in Brazil in 2001.

Grouping household income classes according to the Brazilian Households Expenditure Survey (POF) such that POF[1] is the lowest income class, and POF[10] the highest, it can be seen that, in year 2001, the first 5 income classes, while accounting for 52.6 percent of total population in Brazil, get only 17 percent of total income. The highest income class, on the other hand, accounts for 11 percent of population, and about 45 percent of total income. The Gini index associated with the income distribution in Brazil in 2001, calculated using an equivalent household basis is 0.58, placing Brazil\u2019s income distribution among the world\u2019s worst.<a href=\"#fn4\"><sup>4</sup></a> Unemployment rate is also relatively higher among the poorer classes. With a poverty line defined as one third of the average household income<a href=\"#fn5\"><sup>5</sup></a> about 30.8 percent of the Brazilian households in 2001 would be poor<a href=\"#fn6\"><sup>6</sup></a>, or 34.5 million out of 112 million households in 2001. This general poverty and inequality picture also has an important regional dimension, because economic activity is located mainly in the South-East region. This is particularly true of manufacturing; agriculture is more dispersed among regions. The states in the North region account for 8 percent of total population (7 percent of the poor), compared to 23.5 percent for the Northeast (48 percent of the poor), 45 percent in the Southeast (30 percent of the poor), 16 percent for South (9 percent of the poor), and 7.2 percent for the Centre-West (6 percent of the poor).

Total employment is fixed nationally, which in a comparative-static model means that its long run level is assumed to be unaffected by the policy. Government consumption was kept fixed both at national and regional levels. A \u201cbudget neutral\u201d policy is achieved through an endogenous adjustment in the income tax rate, so that the nationwide total tax collection is kept constant. A direct (income) tax transfer mechanism is put into action to compensate the states for the loss in indirect tax collection, with the national (unique) income tax rate endogenously adjusting to ensure the fiscal neutrality.. The household real consumption is endogenous, both at national and regional levels. And, finally, the Balance of Trade/GDP ratio is exogenous.",

This kind of policy, then, is found to be more income inequality reducing than the first policy, which would be more poverty reducing.
