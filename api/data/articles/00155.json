The articles reflect the diversity of the microsimulation field. Two of them (Thomas <i>et al</i>., and Tomintz <i>et al</i>.) present microsimulation tools. The first one, FamilyScape 3.0, is a static microsimulation model that simulates outcomes related to family formation and child wellbeing, in the United States. Although the model is unfortunately not open source, the authors provide accurate pseudo code of all the processes, in a lengthy appendix. Additional technical documentation is available from the Brookings Institution.",

Two core research objectives were to offer a micro explanation for inflation, and study the relationship between inflation, profits, investment and growth. The model was populated partly with real balance sheet firms, and partly with synthetic firms whose balance sheets were calibrated in order to obtain sector totals. By providing a general equilibrium description of the whole economy, the model represents an early and still not fully acknowledged antecedent of the agent-based modelling approach (<a href=\"#bib3\">Richiardi, 2013</a>), as exemplified by the work of Herbert Dawid and collaborators (<a href=\"#bib1\">Dawid &amp; Neugart, 2011</a>).",
