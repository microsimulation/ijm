The present study focuses on performing investigations on assessing the influence of vehicle and driver characteristics on accurate prediction of traffic volumes in Mangalore city road network. The multi-stage first-level of calibrations were performed starting with default values of vehicle and driver characteristics followed by testing of various combinations. The accuracy of predicting simulated volumes was measured using GEH-statistic. An ANN-based sensitivity analysis was performed to find the relative importance of vehicle and driver characteristics, which revealed that the average standstill distance, minimum look-ahead distance, and the desired speed: lower bounds for speed distributions were highly sensitive. The second-level of calibrations were performed by fine-tuning these three characteristics in three stages and the final VISSIM model was validated.",

In developing economies, the heterogeneous mix of slow and fast-moving vehicles have further contributed to the chaos resulting in roads operating below existing capacities. Traffic engineers and transport planners often resort to traffic flow modeling techniques in order to evolve strategies for effective transport management. In this context, simulation-based approaches are found to be more effective in modeling the traffic flow on roads. Traffic flow modeling using micro-simulation approaches facilitate the study of bottlenecks and assists in the analysis of traffic flow characteristics, the movement of individual vehicles, and the study of vehicle and driver characteristics.",

The calibration of these vehicle and driver characteristics for a wide range of slow and fast motorized vehicles necessitates the use of a larger dataset where many more combinations of data need to be simulated. Due to this reason, it was considered ideal to adopt a deterministic simulation approach focusing on a smaller set of data.

Also, the corresponding GEH statistic values were computed as 7.06 and 7.02 respectively for random seeds 42 and 25. However, the random seed 42 was used for calibrations since <a href=\"#bib33\">Wang et al. (2012)</a> observed that the use of random seeds higher than 25 could result in lesser standard errors. <a href=\"#bib10\">PTV (2014)</a> also recommends the use of random seed 42 especially in the studies related to predicting inter-arrival time of vehicles. Additionally, it was observed in the present study that performing trial runs for random seed greater than 50 resulted in higher prediction errors. In the light of the above references and also based on simulations performed for random seeds 1-50, it may be considered that the likely set of best performing random variables has been evaluated. Thus, the selection of random seed and the calibration of vehicle and driver characteristics are based on a deterministic approach in this study. <a href=\"#bib38\">Liu (2002)</a> too recommends that simulation trials may be performed using a selected set of random seeds in order to achieve the desired results.
