To understand his motivation it helps to return to the econometrics of the 1950:s, 60:s and 70:s which was dominated by the attempts to estimate and test Keynesian macro models and Leontief-type input-output models using aggregate data, which evened out a multitude of micro behavior and created multicollinearity, autoregression and interdependencies. As Orcutt saw it the relatively few macro data points did not include enough information for powerful tests of economic behavior compared to much richer micro data. Although a micro analytic model would have more parameters to be estimated than a conventional macro model, what is important for successful estimation and testing is the ratio between the number of observations and the number of parameters, which he thought would be much higher in the micro analytic approach. He also believed that model estimation would become easier, because assumptions about independence and recursiveness would be more realistic at the micro level than at the macro level. His micro analytic approach would also solve the problem to aggregate non-linear micro relations to macro relations, open up for studies of the heterogeneity of micro behavior and the interaction of micro units in markets, and permit studies of the distributional consequences of policy changes. In an economy wide micro analytic model no macro relations were needed. However, it is interesting to note that Orcutt\u2019s own micro analytic model MAM, presented at the first international microsimulation conference in Stockholm in 1977 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Orcutt and Glaser, 1980</a>), included an auxiliary macro model, which handled the macroeconomic feedback. How much of Guy Orcutt\u2019s visions have now been realized?",

Using a microsimulation model for Australia they simulated a tax increase from 20 to 25% The first-order effect on the tax revenues was an increase by 9.1% while the total \u201c3<sup>rd</sup> round\u201d effect was 11.7-13.4%, depending on the assumption about the wage rate elasticity of demand. This example suggests that behavioral adjustments might be important. However, timing is an issue. A static tax-benefit model does not tell us when these effects will materialize. Do the tax-benefit models open up new exiting prospects for research? I am not so sure.",

The objective variance-elimination (variance-reduction is a better term) is not problematic. As shown in <a href=\"#bib17\">Klevmarken (2002)</a> alignment can be seen as a method to incorporate external information in the estimation process. But the objective mean-correction is problematic. If the simulated distributions deviate more from observed data, than the stochastic properties of the model motivate, then this suggests that data reject either the parameter estimates or the model as such or both. The model should thus not be aligned but re-estimated or reformulated. We should thus test if the model accepts the alignment bench marks or not, before we go ahead with an alignment.

In the microsimulation context the focus is often on distributional issues and then we cannot pass by the stochastic properties of the model easily. We know that distributions of economic variables like income and wealth typically show skewness and kurtosis, and it is not uncommon to find extreme outliers. In general, we will find it difficult to make assumptions about specific distributions. We are then led to choose estimation methods which do not rely on specific distributional assumptions but rather are insensitive to outliers. One should also avoid estimation criteria which <span class=\"underline\">only </span>punish deviations from the mean, but instead use a criterion function which also punishes deviations from higher moments. In previous work I have suggested that a General Method of Moments approach (GMM) might be useful (<a href=\"#bib17\">Klevmarken, 2002</a>). However, the complexity of a typical microsimulation model with nonlinear relations and discrete jumps might make it difficult to evaluate the moment criteria. A potential solution is then to take advantage of the fact that we are working with a simulation model and get the parameter estimates by the simulated method of moments.",

In the absence of specific assumptions about families of distributions, the stochastic properties of the \u201cresiduals\u201d build into the model structure can be estimated using repeated drawings from the empirical residuals. Similarly, for the stochastic properties of the parameter estimates, if it is not possible to deduce the large sample properties of the estimates, their properties can be estimated using resampling techniques, i e random subsamples are drawn from the original data set and the model is re-estimated once for each subsample. This gives a sample of parameter estimates, the empirical distribution of which can be used in the simulations. To estimate the uncertainty that arises from measurement errors in start values, however, becomes more problematic. The only information we are likely to get about this kind of uncertainty comes from the very sample of start values, and possibly from similar samples from adjacent years (time points). For a given variable we would like to estimate the distribution of start values (or at least its variance) for \u201csimilar\u201d micro units. The problem is how one should define \u201csimilar\u201d. Perhaps it would be possible to stratify the sample of start values according to reasonable explanatory variables or estimate a regression model based on these variables and estimate its residual variance.",

If the basic sample of micro units is large this source of uncertainty might not be very important. It depends however on what one wishes to simulate. If the target is an entity in a relatively small subgroup of micro units, then also a large basic sample might become small. The issue is how the sampling probabilities of the original micro units should be forwarded to the remaining and new micro units of an aged sample to give a correct inference to the aged finite population. However, the original sampling probabilities are only designed for an inference to the finite population from which the sample of start values was drawn. They are not necessarily good for an inference to a future population. On the other side a sample drawn with very unequal sampling probabilities is not a good representation of the population if we ignore the sampling probabilities. One approach which has been suggested is to replicate the original micro units to numbers proportional to the inverse of the sampling probabilities. More specifically, to control the sample size, one should multiply the inverse of the sampling probability for each micro unit by the ratio of the original sample size to the size of the population (n/N). If this number is not an integer, it should be rounded to the nearest integer. If a microsimulation model is applied to a sample adjusted in such a way and the resulting simulations lead to a population with a size and composition which differ significantly from those of the demographic predictions produced by the national statistical bureau, then one has to decide either to believe the statistical bureau and change the microsimulation model, or to say that the demographers at the statistical bureau have not done their job!",

Furthermore, there is not only heterogeneity between micro units, but also heterogeneity over time. Consumers adjust their behavior to changes in the consumer markets and in institutions which come about through technical change (introduction of new goods). They also adjust to policy changes and changes in relative prices. Firms also adapt for similar reasons. Some grow, some merge, some go into bankruptcy and some change their lines of production and trade. Does this dynamic heterogeneity necessarily lead to macroeconomic equilibrium? It is true that the economy seems to have checks and balances which bring it back to some kind of stability after a crisis, but is it an equilibrium, and if it is an equilibrium, is it necessarily the same equilibrium as before the crisis? Is it necessary to assume the existence of an equilibrium to get a model to mimic the stability properties we think the real economy possesses? Isn\u2019t it likely that these properties can be traced to the heterogeneity of the micro units and their behavior? Smart consumers and smart firms will find ways to minimize the consequences of a crisis, while some are not as smart and will go out of business, into unemployment and on welfare, and when the rest of us see that we adjust towards a new balance out of the crisis.",

Using his microsimulation model MOSES, he finds that the model under certain circumstances simulates a collapse of the economy. \u201cIf firms are forced to have the same expectations as the sector average and competition assures that there are narrow limits between productivity performances and profit margins, then after 25 years the sector economy collapses.\u201d \u201cThe same thing happened in a similar experiment \u2026. where all firms were made to follow the \u2018leader\u2019 of each market, in this case the largest firm.

In theory they are well suited to model the heterogeneity of micro units, their interaction on markets and the outcome of this interaction.

For these reasons, the ABM approach is promising in integrating micro and macro. <a href=\"#bib30\">Richiardi (2016)</a> and <a href=\"#bib10\">Eliasson (2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">2018)</a> have strongly argued along these lines.

The authors noted that \u201cSome insights into traders\u2019 strategies and their impact on aggregate variables have been provided by agent-based models. These models have shown that the interactions at the micro-level are crucial in comprehending macro-economic dynamics. The agent-based model approach has highlighted the interplay between the micro and macro levels, revealing the similarities and differences between the overall system and its parts.\u201d (p. 2).

Estimation is a problem in itself, which many researchers in the field have neglected. They have been satisfied if the models have been able to reproduce stylized facts. ABMs are driven by the competition among micro units in the markets, which sorts out the fittest to survive while those who do not stand up for the competition will go bankrupt or into poverty. The mathematical structure of such models will include discrete jumps and discontinuities, which might become difficult to handle within standard estimations methods. Never-the-less the quality standard of the inference used for ABMs should be no less than that used for any other stochastic model. We must be able to tell what properties our simulations have. Otherwise, our models are not suitable instruments for policy advise and forecasting. There is a need for further development of estimation-, validation- and simulation methods in this context.",

(2009)</a>. A Markov Chain is a process with a short memory. Do we want to have microsimulation models in which transition probabilities only depend on the state in the nearest previous time period? There is no general answer to this question. It depends on the context and becomes an empirical issue. It has also been suggested that the Markov process should be ergodic and perhaps even stationary, because it facilitates estimation. But are these properties good properties in a microsimulation model? Ergodicity implies that the model tends towards an equilibrium, which does not depend on the start values. Experience from ABM modeling suggests that start values are important, and if not chosen carefully the models might show strong volatility, chaotic behavior and even collaps in the long run. One should therefore prefer not to assume a priori that an ABM has the ergodic property. Similarly, it might be difficult to believe that stationarity is a realistic property of an economy wide ABM.",

It is then not certain that a simple summation across micro units will give exactly the same macro estimates as those produced by a statistical bureau. Some adjustments of the simulated micro data may become necessary.)
