                "text": "Complex population projections usually use microsimulation models; in Canada, Statistics Canada has developed a global dynamic microsimulation model named LifePaths in the Modgen programming language to be used in policy research. LifePaths provides a platform to build on for our research program, conjointly with Dr Janice Keefe from Mount Saint Vincent University, on projections of the Canadian chronic homecare needs for the elderly up to 2031 and of the human resources required. Beside marital status, family networks and living arrangements, future disability status of the elderly is a key variable, but an intricate one. Since disability status transitions were previously conditioned only on age and sex, we will use here the current disability module of LifePaths with longitudinal data from Canada\u2019s National Population Health Survey (NPHS). These new disability status transitions are considering other significant explicative variables like marital status, education etc. We will then present projections of future Canadian elderly by disability status and a comparison with nine European countries for the Future Elderly Living Conditions in Europe (FELICIE) Research Program which has used the same approach. Our previous researches have shown the importance of future disability level for the management of an elderly society. The main output of the present paper would first produce, with new health scenarios, new estimates for Canada of elderly in poor health, for those aged 75 and over. Secondly, it would produce an interesting comparative analysis, useful especially for implementing new policies for the well-being of the Canadian elderly.",

The growing proportion of the elderly population and the changes occurring within the whole age structure of the population threaten the sustainability of social security systems, especially with regards to pensions and health care (<a href=\"#bib18\">World Bank, 1994</a>). In the next 25 years, the most important increases within the elderly population, both in Canada and Europe, are expected to occur among the oldest old, that is people aged 75 years old and over. This rapid growth reflects the aging of the baby-boom cohort as well as an improved survival to and beyond age 75. Although many older people remain in good health until quite advanced ages, risks of becoming disabled increase significantly at age 75 and over. The growing oldest old population has therefore important implications regarding support systems, both formal and informal (<a href=\"#bib4\">Carri\u00e8re <i>et al</i>., 2006</a>). Drawing conclusions on future needs from actual characteristics of the elderly may be misleading; since the elderly population of the future will be very different of those of today (<a href=\"#bib3\">Carri\u00e8re <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>). Therefore, in order to be policy relevant, elderly population projections and their implied needs for support should include covariates like marital status, living arrangements, health conditions, and potential support from surviving partner and children.",

More specifically, a module to project future disability status of Canadian elderly was used to produce two scenarios: the Base LifePaths Disability scenario and the Healthy scenario in which it is assumed that additional years gained in life expectancy will be years without disability.

International comparisons are relevant because they allow the investigators to assess the specificities of Canadian aging. In this case, comparative data are available since two groups of researchers, one Canadian and one European, have been working in close collaboration in the field of the demography of aging. These research programs have now ended and the results have been widely disseminated within the national and international scientific community (see <a href=\"#bib3\">Carri\u00e8re <i>et al.</i>, 2007</a> and Gaymu <i>et al.</i>, 2007). Both research programs produced microsimulated projections for the next 25 years that give comparable results on marital status, family network and support, and on living arrangements and needs for care. Here, the present research allows the health dimension to be comparable in order to use the same future health scenarios; in the first one the gain in life expectancy results in a proportional growth in the years in disability while in the second one the added years in life expectancy are years without disability.",

That year was chosen so that in the year 1971 the model would have a complete and representative set of all ages from newborns to the elderly.

All over the course of a simulation, LifePaths use the information coming form these data to keep updating its list of pending events to ensure that the next scheduled event is the one that currently has the shortest waiting time. This provides a straightforward way of dealing with competing events. Waiting times provide a unifying framework for representing decision-making.

Here, we use the Disability Free Life Expectancy (DFLE) The total Life Expectancy (LE), all health status combined, could be divided in two parts: DFLE and Life Expectancy level, region of residence, marital status, age of spouse, place of birth, and number of surviving children. We also need to differentiate who lives in an institution and who lives in a private household. Only the population living in private households is kept since by definition home care services are strictly aimed at this population. This first step provides a picture of the Canadian population for any given year up to 2031 according to the characteristics on the left of Figure 4. Probabilities of disability status need for assistance, living arrangement, receipt of assistance, and source of assistance are then applied to these populations in the sequence shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. As shown, there is an assumption that living arrangements are partly determined by the need for assistance. Thus, living with others is partially seen as a strategy to cope with a need for assistance related to a disability. This was done only for the non-married with Disability (LEWD). LEWD can be calculated by multiplying persons-years in the life table by disability rates by age using the Sullivan Method. Then, LE<sub>x</sub> = DFLE<sub>x</sub> + LEWD<sub>x</sub> (x = age) (1)",

Moreover, the base scenario predicts a small expansion of disability due to the internal changes occurring in the characteristics of the Canadian population and that are taken into account by LifePaths.
