As if this is not interesting enough by itself, their primary goal is to assess whether the joint taxation of married couples with full income splitting in Germany might explain the relatively low labour force participation of married women. Their first and surprizing conclusion is that for many tax units, the effective tax liabilities in Germany are not greater and for some groups even smaller than in the UK. However, indeed, the joint taxation results in higher effective tax rates for married women than otherwise would have been the case.",

Ugo Colombino however argues that this standard simulation procedure used is not consistent with the comparative statics interpretation. He then proposes an alternative and consistent simulation procedure, and illustrates it with the simulation of alternative reforms of the income support policies in Italy.",

They argue that, by using standard routines, the sampling variance of microsimulation results can be calculated easily, even of relatively complex statistics such as relative poverty, inequality measures and indicators of polarization.",

They present the COMPARE (COMPrehensive Assessment of Reform Efforts) microsimulation model, which has been used to estimate the impact of major policy changes in the United States, such as the Affordable Care Act. A discerning characteristic of this model is that households as well as firms make decisions based on a utility-maximization framework, among other things taking into account government regulations.",
