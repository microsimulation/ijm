These new weights are derived so that the survey data sums to some known totals for a small area (from either a Census or administrative data). There are different methods for calculating these weights, and this paper analyses the results from two different methods \u2013 a generalised regression method and combinatorial optimisation. The weights derived from each method are compared, and advantages and disadvantages of each method are assessed. Estimates of housing stress at a Statistical Local Area in Australia from each method are then calculated, and these estimates are then validated against a third reliable source, Australian Census data from 2001.",

This paper adds to this literature by comparing the generalised regression technique and the combinatorial optimisation technique. Both methods are described in <a href=\"#bib32\">Tanton and Edwards (2013b)</a>. The first uses a Generalised Regression (GREG) approach. GREG is a well-established approach to reweighting survey data (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lehtonen &amp; Veijanen, 2009</a>). The particular algorithm used in this paper iteratively attempts to minimise a truncated exponential distance function using a SAS program called GREGWT, developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics from INSEE\u2019s reweighting macro CALMAR (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bell, 2000</a>). GREGWT is used by the ABS to benchmark their survey data to known State totals. The NATSEM adaptation of this approach to small-area estimation is documented in <a href=\"#bib36\">Tanton <i>et al</i>. (2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">2013</a>) and elaborated below in <a href=\"#s2\">Sections 2</a> and <a href=\"#s3\">3</a> of this paper. The code for GREGWT is available on request from the ABS.",

To reduce the risk of getting trapped in a sub-optimal solution a simulated annealing approach to the acceptance of household changes is adopted. This algorithm is implemented using the program CO, developed by Dr Paul Williamson at the University of Liverpool (<a href=\"#bib40\">Williamson, 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Williamson, <i>et al</i>., 1998</a>) and now available as part of an R library (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kavroudakis, 2013</a>).",

The method uses a truncated linear regression model to get an initial weight (constrained so the weights cannot be below 0 or above a preset limit set by the user). Because these weights are truncated, the boundary conditions may not be met by the initial weights, so an iterative approach is used to match the boundary conditions after a number of iterations. The iterations continue until convergence is reached (so the difference between the estimated benchmark and the actual benchmark for the area from the Census data is within a set limit), or a set number of iterations is made, at which time the iteration stops. The process needs a start weight, and this is set to the original ABS survey weight for the survey record divided by the population of the SLA. In many cases, there is no iteration as the initial regression estimate provides weights that are within the tolerance set.",

In these non-convergent cases the weights from the terminal iteration typically, but not always, include a small number of exceptionally high household weights, leading to very poor fits to one or more benchmark counts. We have chosen not to discard all non-convergent GREGWT outputs, as a few technically non-convergent estimates actually give rise to sets of weights that fit all benchmarks reasonably well. Instead, for the purposes of this paper, we identify as \u2018non-convergent\u2019 any SLA for which the sum of the absolute value of all errors across all benchmarks is greater than the number of households in the SLA; so where:",

For each household in an SLA (as recorded in the Census benchmark counts), CO randomly selects one household (with replacement) from the survey dataset. This is equivalent to setting all survey household weights to 0, then incrementing household weights at random by a count of 1 until the sum of weighted households matches the equivalent benchmark count. In each subsequent iteration the weight of one survey household is randomly increased by one, whilst the weight of another (non-zero weighted) household is randomly decreased by one. This is equivalent to randomly swapping households in and out of the set (combination) of households currently selected to represent the SLA. If the change in weights leads to improved fit, the change is retained; a few adverse changes in weights are also accepted, with a probability that diminishes in proportion to (i) size of the adverse impact and (ii) number of iterations, in order to avoid getting stuck in a local sub-optima; otherwise the change is rejected and the weights are reverted to their previous values. CO will continue to iterate until either a minimum fit threshold is achieved, or until a maximum number of user-specified iterations has been exceeded (5 million for the results reported in this paper).

The underlying principle behind this second measure is the use of a modified Z-score for each benchmark count that takes into account not only the proportional difference between observed and expected counts (as with a normal Z-score), but also the absolute difference between estimated and observed benchmark table totals. The resulting sum of squared modified Z-scores for each benchmark table is divided by the relevant table-specific \u03c7<sup>2</sup> critical value to standardise for the number of benchmark counts in each benchmark table. These table-specific relative scores are then summed to yield the overall measure, the main focus of which is upon proportional rather than absolute fit.",

In contrast, the GREGWT and CO estimates have been weighted to fit benchmarks in which non-response households have been included via pro rating (see <a href=\"#s3\">Section 3</a>). Given that pro rating should more or less preserve the proportional distribution of households by income and housing cost, and given that the CO and GREGWT estimates closely replicate ABS estimates of the proportion of households in housing stress, it could in fact be argued that it is actually the ABS absolute estimates that are out of line.

In all three of the estimate comparisons made here (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>), the slope is less than 1. This means that the CO and GREGWT estimates are typically higher than the ABS estimates for low levels of housing stress; and vice versa for high levels of housing stress. The second was that the SEI assumes an intercept of 0. In all three graphs, the intercept is not 0, suggesting a consistent bias in our results that the SEI would treat as error.",

It can be seen that the correlations are all very high (0.86 \u2013 0.89). The highest correlation (and therefore lowest error) is from using the CO-Min Proportion model. Clearly the ranking of the three model estimates depends upon the precise measure used.
