The model, based on the Eurostat Survey on Income and Living Conditions, makes projections from 2009 to 2050 and it is organised in modules: demography, education, labour and income and social security. IrpetDin produces realistic projections even for the Region of Tuscany and models education and labour with details. Probabilities and rates are estimated differently for Italy and Tuscany, trough regional administrative data. Education careers are completely simulated, from the choice of secondary school to drop-out, from university enrolment to graduation. Labour supply is endogenously determined while labour demand is driven from IRPET\u2019s macro model. The matching of labour supply and demand is modelled by sector of activity and education, in order to estimate the quantitative and the qualitative mismatch.",

In their LABORsim model, <a href=\"#bib12\">Leombruni and Richiardi (2006)</a> focus the analysis on education, labour and pensions. Out of all social security programmes, pensions are undoubtedly the most studied. Models such as LIAM (<a href=\"#bib19\">O\u2019Donoghue et al., 2009</a>) and MIDAS (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dekkers, 2010</a>) have been used to look at pension reforms, with a few models also being used to examine changes to funding for education (e.g. <a href=\"#bib8\">Hain and Helberger, 1986</a>).",

EU-SILC collects extensive information on family members and incomes, even at regional level. It is therefore able to meet IrpetDin\u2019s objective of predicting both socio-demographic trends and the effects of welfare reforms, even only with regard to the Region of Tuscany. However, as is the case with all survey data, the issue with EU-SILC is its small sample size, making it unreliable with regard to certain, specific information and inaccurate in terms of small area estimates. For these reasons, which we will explain in more detail later on, adjustments need to be made to the original EU-SILC sample. Other Italian dynamic microsimulation models have also used EU-SILC, such as <a href=\"#bib16\">Mazzaferro and Morciano (2012)</a> and <a href=\"#bib4\">Caretta et al. (2012)</a>.

Furthermore, the closed model method is used as it presents a fixed set of individuals, with the exception of newborns and migrants, to simulate events, i.e. those belonging to the initial sample. It then uses a dynamic ageing procedure to update the initial sample over time, changing the attributes of the individuals concerned (e.g. their age, employment status, etc.) instead of altering sample weights, as would be the case with a static ageing procedure. These updates are completed annually, as per many discrete-time dynamic models.",

As can be easily seen, EU-SILC strongly overestimates the number of people aged 0 and under/overestimates other ages. Furthermore, the initial sample does not specify the age of people over 79 years old.

We then simulate career progressions for employees, from blue-collar worker to white-collar worker, to manager and then from manager to executive, by sector of activity. Transition rates are calculated based on the Italian Labour Force Survey and are then attributed to employees. Part-time work is imputed after estimating a model for the probability of being employed part-time depending on gender, age and number of children. In order to stabilize the value we estimate the probability of being employed part-time on five waves of the Italian Labour Force survey (2009-2013). Given that in Italy part time work has been strongly affected by the economic crisis of 2009<sup><a href=\"#fn17\">17</a></sup> we estimate a second model, with the same covariates, on the two waves 2018 and 2019 of the Italian Labour Force survey.
