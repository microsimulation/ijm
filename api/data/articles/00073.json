Developed and operated on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Finance, MIKMOD-ESt is extensively used to evaluate numerous proposals for reforms of personal income taxation in Germany. The aim of this paper is to shed light on various aspects of the model. These include information on the microdata used for simulation (source and date, differences to other data sets) as well as the method for updating and uprating the data. Based on these information, advantages in comparison to other existing tax(-benefit) models as well as limitations of the current simulation model are discussed. Advantages are, e.g. the full inclusion of all taxpayers above a certain income threshold by using official tax returns or the possibility to conduct microsimulation analyses in a very detailed manner that allows for evaluation of very small and selective reforms. The main constraints are the restriction of the database to those currently obliged to file a tax return and the lack of information necessary to model the behavioural responses to tax changes.",

The stratifying approach ensures that all taxpayers from the top of the income distribution are contained in the sample. That is to say in contrast to taxpayers with medium or low incomes the high income cases get an individual weighting factor equal to one. These observations are of major importance for microsimulation modelling since the taxpayers from the top decile of the income distribution contribute about 55 percent of personal income taxes paid (see <a href=\"#bib4\">Bundesministerium der Finanzen, 2012</a>). The 10% sample provides information on more than one thousand different variables for each of the cases. Nearly all characteristics of each taxpayer are included that are relevant for tax determination, e.g. sources and amounts of incomes, deductions, child allowances, taxable income, and amount of income tax, of church tax and of solidarity surcharge paid. Moreover some limited information on socio-economic characteristics is included as well like gender, age, state of residence, and economic activity of entrepreneurs. Before the administrative tax data can be used within the microsimulation model, the data has to be processed in an approach that basically consists of four independent steps: reduction of the sample size, reduction of the number of variables used, imputation of missing information, and extrapolation of the data.",

Hence, both the sample size and the number of variables are downsized. In order to precisely map the aggregate tax statistics in line with the explanation given above, taxpayers from top of the income distribution are fully incorporate in the downsized subsample. Thereby, we arrive at a reduced final sample that includes all taxpayers with total revenue above a threshold of 500,000 Euros and a randomly drawn subsample of taxpayers with lower incomes.

In cases where specific input variables are missing, existing information on input variables of all similar cases is used. Hereby, the large size of the data base is an asset as it yields reliable information on the distribution of the majority of input variables. In this way, missing values can be imputed such that the calculations made for a particular case with lacking information finally matches the official result, i.e. tax liability<sup><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup>. Further imputations concern missing values in the data for those cases where the tax law grants lump-sum deductions and taxpayers provide no information about their expenses below the lump-sum. After the modifications it is possible to precisely recalculate current tax liabilities for more than 99 percent of the cases in the sample.

Adjustments are made for all years of the analysis and the resulting weighting factors for each single year are stored as additional variables in the sample. Moreover, factors to update the data of the base year are kept in a parameter file for each category of income and for each year of the estimation period, i.e. 2007 till 2016.

Thereby fiscal and distributional impacts of a wide range of tax reforms can be evaluated in much more detail than would be feasible using other German data sets. Two major alternative data sets are the scientific-use file of the income tax data (FAST) and the German Socio-economic panel (GSOEP)<sup><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup>.",

The difference in the degree of anonymization is shown in the lower part of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. In particular, anonymization of the cases of the FAST increases with categories based on revenues of the taxpayer (see <a href=\"#bib11\">Merz et. al., 2006</a>, and <a href=\"#bib5\">Buschle and Schwabbacher, 2010</a>, for a more detailed description). Consequently, detailed simulations for top income households are rather difficult using the FAST. Another advantage of the official tax return data lies in its huge size. Compared to approximately 12,000 household observations for instance offered by the GSOEP, even the subsample used by MIKMOD-ESt with just below 500,000 observations allows in-depth distributional analysis as well as analysis of very specific tax issues in a way not possible with survey data<sup><a href=\"#fn7\">7</a></sup>. While the analysis of smaller subgroups such as groups differentiated by age or federal state quickly reach limitations in the number of observations in the GSOEP they are possible using MIKMOD-ESt. Another drawback of the survey data like the GSOEP is the shortfall of a number of tax relevant information, an incomplete coverage of certain types of income<sup><a href=\"#fn8\">8</a></sup>, and the lack of representative data on the top of the income distribution. A major advantage of the GSOEP data is given by the fact that it offers a large number of socio-economic variables not included in the administrative data, which for example allows adding more important dimensions when analysing distributional effects, or, in the case of information on hours worked, open the possibility to model behavioural effects.

Thereby a more complete picture of the lower end of the income distribution is given that allows to model the benefit system as well.

Even without the legislator\u2019s specification as in the case of child allowances and private pension contributions the optimal choice from the taxpayer\u2019s perspective is always the guiding principle when modelling alternatives within the model. In such cases different possibilities of calculation have to be performed next to each other to decide afterwards which option is chosen, according to the outcomes. That is to say it has to be determined whether a direct payment receivable exceeds the difference between a tax payment based on a taxable income without reduction by a possible allowance and tax payment based on a taxable income lowered by such an allowance. Thereby, the optimal choice for the taxpayer is selected as prescribed by the tax law. where necessary, this also includes the special treatment of extraordinary incomes, <sup><a href=\"#fn11\">11</a></sup> e.g. compensations for longer-term activities, and the application of a progression reservation among others on unemployment and parental leave benefits.

In the latter case, a withholding tax with a flat rate of 25 percent is applied. After the five steps of the tax calculation the whole simulation has to be run a second time in case a taxpayer has income from capital. In the second run it is tested whether the sum of tax payments from the withholding tax and personal income taxes on incomes except income from capital is lower or higher than the tax payments obtained from the first calculation (right-hand side of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Since no information can be found in the data whether a tax-unit chooses to tax its income from capital within the personal income tax or under the flat rate tax the guiding assumption again is that each tax-unit chooses the alternative which minimizes total tax payments in that year.

The model is regularly employed for the fiscal evaluation of family policies such as the total amount of forgone tax revenue because of child allowance, the share of transfers incorporated in the child benefit, tax reliefs due to income splitting for married couples, (limited) income shifting between divorced taxpayers, or the tax allowance for lone parents. Within MIKMOD-ESt the procedure is always to compute tax payments for each observation of the data sample first under the law applicable in the year of consideration. To do so, the different tax codes for the years between 2006 and 2012 are incorporated in the model, either via tax parameters or directly in the programming code. In a second step, calculations are repeated under a changed tax law. To simplify the application of MIKMOD-ESt, modifications analysed more frequently can be done via parameter change while more complex or less frequently requested modifications of the law need changes in the programming code.",

Most recently, the model was used in collaboration with the German Statistical Office to evaluate possible changes from the implementation of a community surcharge on income taxes paid, which was intended to compensate communities for losses from a possible abolishment of the current business tax (<a href=\"#bib14\">Schwabbacher et. al., 2011</a>). The model was also used to estimate tax losses and distributional effects for different alternatives of a better deductibility of health insurance contributions (<a href=\"#bib6\">Deutscher Bundestag, 2009</a>). A corresponding and indeed quite complex reform of the tax deductibility of health insurance contributions with an estimated total tax relief of about 10 billion Euros per year actually took place in 2010 and parts of our estimates directly entered the bill.",

This is the case especially for high income taxpayers, since when choosing between the withholding tax with its flat rate of 25 percent or taxation within the personal income tax, only for small incomes the treatment of capital gains within the usual personal income tax is preferable. All income groups that face a marginal tax rate above 25 percent will hence opt for taxation of capital gains under the source tax scheme at the favourable rate of 25 percent. As a consequence, information on capital gains will no longer be available in the tax return data for all income groups but the ones with small incomes. However, as has been previously explained the major parts of tax revenue result from higher income groups. Therefore, missing information on capital gains, which contribute a large part of total income for a number of cases of taxpayers who belong to the higher end of the income distribution, lead to a non-negligible loss in precision of modelling total tax revenue from the respective income category. As appropriate microdata on capital gains do not exist outside the tax statistics, imputation or matching procedures are not possible. In the short run, it would be possible to use information on capital income from the 2008 data for future years, but in the long run an alternative solution for this missing data problem has to be found.",

The use of data anonymized to the lowest possible degree which is still compatible with German law allows in-depth distributional as well as fiscal analysis of different reforms. Effects for a variety of reform options can be calculated very precisely and results of the model have a great importance for policy makers. However, due to the restrictive legislation on data protection policy in Germany the model cannot be used for purely scientific analysis. In addition, the focus on current taxpayers and on the attributes necessary for the calculation of income taxes makes the model unsuited for the analysis of major reforms of the tax system where taxation is expanded to previously unaffected persons or where significant behavioural responses can be expected.",
