The sharp fall in fertility allied with lengthening life spans will result in sharp increases in the number of older Australians in coming years. Population ageing is expected to have profound consequences for government, due to the higher health, aged care and pension costs and slower economic growth associated with an ageing population (<a href=\"#bib7\">Treasury, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Productivity Commission, 2005</a>). During the past few years the Federal Government has been encouraging the baby boomers to save harder and work longer, so that they can help finance a comfortable living standard in retirement. But have these messages been heeded?",

In the 2004 data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, upon which this reports relies heavily, the boomers are aged about 45 to 59 years \u2014 while today, and in some of the later ABS data that we use, some of them have edged into their sixties. In the remainder of this report we are particularly interested in the outcomes just before retirement, so we have also examined outcomes for 60 to 64 year olds (which also accords up with the five year age categories used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics). We have also broken down the information into age groups of 45-54, 55-59, and 60-64 as the behaviour of differing age groups can vary greatly.",

Boomer couples in this age range are more likely to have some form of debt than single boomers, with about half of all male single boomers aged 55 to 59 having some form of debt, about 60 per cent of female single boomers, and around three-quarters of all couple boomer households aged 55 to 59 having some form of debt.",

This is, of course, a crucial age group, as most are unlikely to earn much in the future and thus will have a reduced capacity to pay off debt as they enter old age. Again focusing on this 60 to 64 year age group, about two-thirds of couple households and about three-quarters of couple households with dependent children still at home report that they still have some debt. Only in a minority of cases is this still due to the struggle to pay off the mortgage on the family home, as only one-tenth of couples without children aged 60 to 64, one-fifth of couples with children and about one-sixth of single males are still paying off the family castle. Single females in their early 60s are even more likely to have paid off the mortgage, with only four per cent still logging mortgage repayments (<a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a>).",
