                "text": "Argentina adopted an early lock-down strategy to mitigate the COVID19 pandemic in March 2020. To allow households that were out of the formal labour market to abide by the lock-down, an Emergency Family Income (IFE) was given to households with no pension or formal labour income between April and September 2020. The benefit was praised for its role in reducing poverty and providing for millions of households that had lost their income, but it was discontinued after September 2020 when most of the COVID19 restrictions had been lifted. In this paper, we run counter-factual dynamic simulations of what would have been the cost and distributive impact of maintaining the IFE after September 2020, and making it a permanent benefit. We show this would have represented initially a yearly additional expenditure of nearly 1.5% of GDP, with a downward trend. This is comparable to the cost of all family benefits. We also estimate that a permanent IFE would have significantly reduced income inequality. We thus show a permanent IFE would be financially feasible, although whether it is desirable or how it should be funded is open to debate.",

There was an ongoing recession, with GDP falling -2.5% and -2.2% in 2018 and 2019, with a further recession at -1.3% of GDP for 2020 projected by late 2019 (<a href=\"#bib1\">ECLAC, 2019</a>). Argentina had gone into a financial, currency and sovereign debt crisis in May 2018, when access to international financial markets was cut. The government signed a stand-by agreement with the IMF in June 2018. Although the agreement allegedly was of a precautionary type, the government received nearly 45 billion of US dollars between June 2018 and July 2019 from the IMF, which did not restore confidence as expected. No further disbursements were made when the then president Macri lost a primary election to the peronist party\u2019s candidate Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez in August 2019. In September 2019 the payment of short-term domestic debt in pesos was postponed, which meant access to the domestic financial market was also cut off. Between May 2018 and December 2019, the US dollar soared by 197% in Argentinian pesos, inflation figures reached their highest level since the 1991 hyperinflation (53.8% on average for 2019), and there was no access to financial markets or further funding from the IMF.",

Each household that had no other source of income would receive a $10,000 pesos benefit, which was equivalent to 59% of the minimum wage, or 156 USD. The two lower categories of the small independent workers scheme, the <i>monotributo</i>, could also earn the benefit, following Art. 2 of Decree 310/2020.",

Following <a href=\"#bib4\">ANSES (2020)</a>, without the IFE 1.4 million people would have become poor. Also, 2.8 million people would have fallen into extreme poverty in the second quarter of 2020. This would have increased by 3 percentage points the poverty rate, and by 6 percentage points extreme poverty figures. According to the Catholic University of Argentina, in the third quarter of 2020 the IFE prevented an increase in poverty and extreme poverty rates of respectively 6.4 and 8.3 percentage points (<a href=\"#bib5\">UCA, 2020</a>). The ATP and the IFE ended up being the two main measures taken by the Argentinian government to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID19. Together, they explained most of the 4.2% GDP increase in current transfers estimated by <a href=\"#bib2\">ECLAC (2021)</a>.

However, as the economy started recovering in parallel with the easing of non-pharmaceutical measures to contain the COVID19 by the third quarter of 2020, it was decided not to renew this benefit past September. As explained earlier, the Argentinian government could not get net voluntary funding neither in the domestic or international financial markets, nor from the IMF. As such, the IFE was mostly funded with money emission by the Central Bank. Even though inflation decreased significantly in 2020 (36.1%) due to the economic recession and stabilisation of the Argentinian peso, the fourth quarter of 2020 saw an up-tick in monthly inflation figures as the economy started recovering, and an increasing gap between the official and parallel exchange rates. Also, a significant point under negotiation with the IMF is primary deficit figures, pointing to the limitation of public spending.",

The IFE also prompted a debate on whether there should be a permanent universal base income, in a country where a large proportion of its population is excluded from the formal workforce. It even prompted similar measures in neighbouring countries, to the point that the government of Chile implemented in May 2020 its own Emergency Family Income, keeping the same name as its Argentinian counterpart. Other countries, such as Brazil, instituted similar government transfers at the onset of the COVID19 pandemic, but paid them for a longer time (in the case of Brazil, up until January 2021). Therefore, it is important to anticipate what would be the cost and impact of a permanent IFE, not only because it is a measure that is likely to return this austral winter if the vaccination campaign is unable to prevent a second wave of COVID19 in Argentina. But also, because it could serve as a baseline for future informality and poverty tackling policies.",

It also estimates the distributive impact of the three IFE payments that were made in 2020, \"now-casting\" the benefit\u2019s impact while waiting for official figures. To do this, we adapt the existing dynamic Microsimulation model for Social Security in Argentina (MISSAR) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calcagno, 2018</a>), to model the IFE. In Section 2 we give a brief account of the methodology used for the estimation, as well as the macroeconomic data and hypotheses we adopted in our projections.

It is also necessary to work with heterogeneous individuals: the IFE is targeted at specific households, and was thought as a way to allow the most vulnerable households to abide by the lock-down even if they lost their labour income. Therefore, it has a strong distributive impact, so one of the outputs we are most interested in is how this benefit impacted income inequality, and what would be the distributive impact of a hypothetical permanent IFE.

The objective of the MISSAR model is to simulate social security contributions as well as the most relevant benefits paid by Argentina\u2019s National Social Security Administration (ANSES). To do so, it takes as a starting population the fourth quarter of 2014 wave of Argentina\u2019s Permanent Household Survey (EPH). This is a randomised sample of the inhabitants of 31 Argentinian cities and metropolitan areas that represent most of Argentina\u2019s urban population, and hence most of its inhabitants, since about 91% of Argentinians live in towns of more than 2000 inhabitants.<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup>",

We model plausible individual behaviour in line with individual characteristics by estimating logit behavioural models and Mincer wage equations (<a href=\"#bib8\">Mincer and Polachek, 1974</a>) based on the EPHc 2003-2015 waves, since these track individual transitions at both a quarterly and yearly pace. The macro-level consistency of the synthetic dataset is ensured through an alignment by sorting procedure made available by LIAM2, where we assume there is a given proportion of individuals that will make a determined transition (for instance, working in the formal labour-market). We pick just enough individuals among the persons that may make this transition to reproduce these exogenous proportions, and we select in priority those who are the most likely to make this transition due to their characteristics. The end result is a synthetic quarterly panel data that spans the 2014-2040 period, from where are computed each period social security contributions and benefits depending on each individual\u2019s situation. <a href=\"#bib6\">Calcagno (2018)</a> describes extensively the methodology of the MISSAR model, and gives a token of its results with social security projections using May 2018 legislation.",

All this information is available at the individual level with heterogeneous individuals, while the modelled dataset is at the same time representative of the Argentinian population as a whole. It is then possible to combine an aggregate-level study of a permanent IFE\u2019s future cost and coverage, with an individual-level estimation of the benefit\u2019s distributive impact.

The most significant one is that the IFE is a household-level benefit: only one is given per dwelling, and none of the household members can have a pension or a formal source of income (except for small own-account workers in the two lowest categories of the <i>monotributo</i> regime). A short-coming of the MISSAR model, designed primarily for computing retirement benefits that are mostly independent from household composition, is that it imperfectly simulates households. The initial version of the MISSAR model described in <a href=\"#bib6\">Calcagno (2018)</a> had nearly 18% of simulated households with no labour or pension revenue, while only 3% of households surveyed in the fourth quarter of 2014 EPHc were in this situation. There has been a methodological change in the EPH starting in 2016, where in particular they stopped inputting missing values of labour income for working individuals (<a href=\"#bib9\">INDEC, 2017</a>), so it is tricky to know for sure what is the actual proportion of households with no labour or pension income. It is possible that the actual figure of households with no labour or pension income is higher than 3%, but it certainly does not reach 18% of households as originally modelled in <a href=\"#bib6\">Calcagno (2018)</a>.",

First, we toughened the pre-requisites for a young adult to leave the parental household: only those older than 24 and working are compelled to leave the household by the model. We then allowed for young adults to go back to their parent\u2019s household if they are single and not working, up to age 40. Finally, we tweaked our labour-market module so that informal workers are selected in priority among households that have no member that receives a retirement benefit or a formal source of income. We thus lower the proportion of households where all adults are either unemployed or inactive, something that cannot be attained even through our estimated logit behavioural equations. These behaviours are also logical, as they factor in family assistance and the fact each household needs at least one source of revenue in the short term.",

The proportion reaches 0% for the months where the IFE was paid. A projected increase in labour-market participation, as detailed in our scenarios in Section 2.3, along with the adjustment measures included in the MISSAR model allow for a decrease in households with no labour or pension revenue, which reach 2% of the total in 2040 in our central economic scenario. This results in a simulated access to the IFE of 36% the second quarter of 2020, which is slightly higher than the 31.6% of households that got the IFE following <a href=\"#bib4\">ANSES (2020)</a>, as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>.

As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, the real increase in pensions is significantly higher in the optimistic economic scenario as compared to the pessimistic projections. This is why the estimated share of the IFE as a percent of GDP is usually higher in our optimistic economic scenario, despite having a lower coverage. By 2030 it goes down to 1.1% of GDP, and as the coverage of the IFE further drops, it goes down to 0.2% of GDP by 2040. Also, after 2023, its cost is higher than adopting an inflation indexation in all our economic scenarios. This means that, apart from the initial raise to make the IFE match its third quarter of 2020 values, the Law 27609 pension indexation increases benefits consistently over inflation figures in our economic scenarios, as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>.",

Even if we take the more generous on average pension mobility indexation, the cost of a permanent hypothetical IFE would not go beyond 1.6% of GDP, and would gradually decrease as the economy recovers. This is comparable to the cost of all family benefits paid by ANSES, which represented 1.5% of GDP in 2019. A permanent IFE would thus represent a significant but not exorbitant budgetary cost, which would additionally decrease over time. For instance, the tax on checking account payments (or \"Check\" tax), which should have been eliminated following the 2017 fiscal reform Law 27430, represents 1.6% of GDP. Also, the one-time extraordinary contribution of the 12 thousand wealthiest Argentinian tax-payers to fund measures taken to face the COVID19 pandemic is expected to represent nearly 1% of GDP.",

As such, the simulated Gini index levels are likely higher than their actual values, because the Gini index is very sensitive to null values, and we need to factor in households with no labour income if we want to study the distributive impact of the IFE. The values estimated for 2020 (0.49 and 0.56 with and without the IFE) are significantly higher than the Gini index we computed on labour income for the fourth quarter of 2014 EPH wave (0.43), using the methodology of <a href=\"#bib14\">CEDLAS and The World Bank (2014)</a>. This bias is however less important when computing the top and bottom 10% income shares, as we computed on the fourth quarter of 2014 that these deciles captured respectively 22% and 2% of total labour income (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calcagno, 2018</a>).",

Meanwhile, smaller households may cumulate informal labour income, or income from smaller monotributo categories, and the IFE.

The Emergency Family Income was thought as an integral part of the non-pharmaceutical government interventions taken to contain the COVID19 pandemic in March 2020.

The non-renewal of this benefit past September 2020 also followed this same logic: since by October most restrictions to economic activities had been lifted in the country, there was no further need to ask the population to stay home, so the IFE could be discontinued. Finally, the official promise to reintroduce the IFE in case of a second lock-down underlines that the current political consensus is that the IFE should function as a tool to fight the COVID19 pandemic, not as a permanent measure.",

We however also show this cost would decline in time, assuming there is economic growth and lower levels of unemployment and inactivity rates. This also means that, if there is a second lock-down in Argentina this austral winter, then such a measure would cost roughly 0.4% of GDP per quarter, which is not an insurmountable amount. Also, despite the methodological limits we faced when adapting the Dynamic Microsimulation Model for Social Security in Argentina (MISSAR) to the modelling of the IFE, we show it would have a positive, lasting, and significant distributive impact.",

On the other hand, it would strengthen our analysis to lift the hypothesis that GDP growth is independent from social security benefits: the contribution to consumption, as well as the reduction of poverty levels and of inequality as a result of a permanent IFE, would surely increase long-term GDP growth, and may partially offset its financial cost.

If such a measure is funded through regressive measures such as an increase in the VAT, it loses most of its significance. Advocates of a permanent Universal Base Income such as <a href=\"#bib21\">Fern\u00e1ndez Pastor (2020)</a> know this, and propose raising a range of progressive taxes such as increasing employers contributions or reintroducing a inheritance tax, and unifying this base income with other existing benefits.

The current consensus is that the IFE is part of the non-pharmaceutical government interventions to fight COVID19, and it currently does not have the vocation of becoming a permanent social security measure. We believe this consensus is not self-evident. The questions going forward are whether it is desirable to spend 1.5% of GDP the first years in an extended IFE; if so, who should pay for this expense; whether there are other priorities for government spending; if it is even desirable to give an unconditional income to households outside of the formal labour force; and if this kind of benefit would be the best way to contain and, eventually, eradicate extreme poverty.

This approximation is not taken into account in the MISSAR model, as it simulates pension mobility with the lump-sum in March 2020.",
