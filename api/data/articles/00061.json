                "text": "Chronic diseases \u2013 eg heart disease, cancer, diabetes, mental disorders \u2013 affect around 80% of older Australians, are the main causes of disability and premature death, and account for 70% of total health expenditures. Because lifestyle patterns are major risk factors, chronic disease prevention and treatment are not only of medical concern, but also of considerable social, family-level and personal interest. While this makes microsimulation approaches particularly suitable for assessing intervention costs and benefits, such approaches will need to be combined with disease-progression models if health status and treatment choices are also to be simulated. Aims: Describe methodological and technical proposals for the development of a cost-benefit model-system. Methods: Several chronic disease progression models are to be linked to an \u2018Umbrella\u2019 microsimulation model representing the Australian population. To project 20 years ahead, use of reweighting techniques are proposed for population projections, disease-specific predictions and for health-related projections. The model-system is to account simultaneously for Australians\u2019 demographic, socioeconomic and health-risk-factor characteristics; progression of their health status; the number of chronic diseases (comorbidities) they accumulate over time; health-related expenditures; and changes in quality of life. Standard methods are proposed to estimate costs versus benefits of simulated policy interventions and related quality of life improvements. Key outcome: Proposal of novel methods for modelling comorbidities \u2013 a task rarely attempted, although quality of life is known to decline and health expenditures to increase well above what a linear addition of the effects of individual chronic diseases would predict.",

Rarely have all major chronic diseases been studied simultaneously, although many share common lifestyle risk factors. Accounting for all chronic diseases is important because quality of life has been shown to decline and health expenditures to increase with comorbidities (<a href=\"#bib78\">Walker 2007a</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Shwartz <i>et al</i>., 1996</a>).",

It is planned that initially the model-system will account for only two chronic diseases: cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes (Type 2). Key reasons for choosing CVD and diabetes are that: (a) they are major contributors to Australia\u2019s total burden of disease (<a href=\"#bib38\">Begg <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>); (b) for people with diabetes CVD is a common complication accounting for 60% of deaths; and (c) CVD and diabetes share common risk factors such as physical inactivity and obesity. Once the benefits of HealthAgeingMod are proven with these two disease-specific sub-models, then further diseases may be added (eg cancers, arthritis, mental health).

The 5-year intervals will allow simulation of diabetes and CVD screening interventions that are recommended to be repeated every five years. The disease specific sub-models will project ahead at yearly intervals, so disease specific projections that are likely to be needed yearly (eg onset of diseases, deaths) can be stored during the simulation phase. The population projections will be estimated so that the model\u2019s weighted base population lines up, to the extent possible, with published ABS population projections (<a href=\"#bib6\">ABS 2005b</a>).

Because of this we propose that each survey individual with one or more of the chronic diseases be transformed into a number of unit records, summing to the \u2018weight\u2019 initially attached to that survey individual. Enumeration of all persons with the chronic disease will allow a much finer specification of the health variables imputed onto the Umbrella model\u2019s base dataset (eg measured glucose levels) than what would be possible without such enumeration. The sub- models will be disease-specific incidence and/or progression models, predicting changes over time in the health states and risk factors of each individual included in the Umbrella model\u2019s population. Disease-specific models can be of varied types: eg econometric, transition probability, parametric, proportional hazard or Weibull models. The model-system will also make use of standard cost-benefit and cost effectiveness methods (<a href=\"#bib59\">Jena and Philipson 2007</a>).",

While many full population-based microsimulation models had been, or are being, developed worldwide, most fall within the tax and social security fields (see review in <a href=\"#bib91\">Zaidi and Rake 2001</a>). The few that account for health tend to be either of the socioeconomic type, which use a broad indicator of health as a covariate within the larger picture, or of the disease-specific type, designed to study disease specific treatment options so as to assess their cost effectiveness (see reviews in <a href=\"#bib62\">Lymer 2009</a> and <a href=\"#bib77\">Walker 2009</a>).",

While many of these are now routinely available in ABS surveys, indicators of the important linkages between physical health, mental health and general wellbeing are in general significantly under- represented (<a href=\"#bib34\">Appleby 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Wilkinson 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">WHO 2005b</a>). These requirements suggest a dynamic microsimulation model based on nationally representative longitudinal unit record data. However, in Australia such datasets tend to be cross-sectional in nature. Also, although such datasets do contain a wide range of variables, the aggregate nature of many of the disease-level variables means that they do not fully meet our requirements. Hence we propose a static microsimulation Umbrella model, with its base-year population projected 20 years ahead at 5-year intervals.",

The method involves computing monetary flows of costs and benefits over time. In most studies discounting is used to account for people\u2019s general preference for money \u2018in the hand now\u2019 (rather than for money expected in future). From the streams of costs (or benefits) a single measure is often computed in the form of net present value (NPV). NPV is the sum of the yearly discounted cash values over that period. From the NPVs either a net gain (that is, benefits minus costs) or a benefit\u2013cost ratio (that is, benefits divided by costs) can be computed, which can then be used for ranking various proposals. A disadvantage of this approach is that not all costs or benefits can be expressed in monetary terms. However, the cost-benefit approach can be complemented with cost-utility analysis to allow for consideration of hard-to-measure factors such as disability-free life years gained.

The Anderson parametric statistical equations separately predict probabilities for: MI, coronary heart disease (CHD), CHD death, stroke, CVD and CVD death. Explanatory variables include age, sex; systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, cholesterol (ratio of total to HDL) and diabetes. One advantage of the Anderson parametric model -compared with standard regression models \u2013 is that predictions can be obtained relatively easily for different lengths of time. The authors recommended time intervals of 4 to 12 years. They concluded that, apart from stroke, the CHD equation was a good predictor for all the other conditions modelled.

We propose to do this by including people with both diabetes and CVD in the Diabetes sub-model only, and people with CVD only in the CVD sub-model. An unexpected feature of the Anderson equations is that BMI was found to be statistically insignificant. However, certain pre and post 1991 research using Framingham data found that BMI was an independent risk factor for CVD (<a href=\"#bib54\">Hubert <i>et al</i>., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Kenchaiah <i>et al</i>., 2002</a>).

For example, <a href=\"#bib1\">ABS (2006a</a>) found that 20% of people (and 27% of 65+ year olds) with diabetes also reported having a long term heart, stroke or vascular disease. Also, <a href=\"#bib37\">Barr <i>et al</i>. (2007)</a> reported that over two-thirds of all CVD deaths in the AusDiab cohort occurred in people with diabetes or pre-diabetes. Although being able to apply the CVD model only to persons without diabetes makes the linking of diabetes and CVD sub-models unnecessary, statistics of this kind are expected to be useful when validating the chronic disease model-system.",
