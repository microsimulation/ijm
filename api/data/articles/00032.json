Specifically, this paper examines the macroeconomic, poverty and welfare impacts of complete and unilateral domestic trade liberalization in Bangladesh over the last two decades. Two different poverty lines for rural and urban households are used, which are endogenously determined by the model taking into account the rural and urban Consumer Price Indices (CPIs). The results suggests marked differences between the short and long run impacts of tariff liberalization. In the short run there are possibilities of reduced welfare and increased poverty. However, in the long run, resources are reallocated towards the more efficient and expanding sectors, generating positive outcomes in terms of welfare gains and poverty reduction.",

                    "text": "Trade liberalization is one of the major policy reform issues in Bangladesh. Stretching back to the 1980s, when successive governments pursued reforms to make the economy more outward-oriented there has been a remarkable simplification in import procedures, a substantial decline in quantitative restrictions and sufficient opening up of trade in many restricted items. The rationalization of the tariff structure and floating of the exchange rates may have facilitated this process of trade liberalization. Trade policy reform also introduced generous promotional measures for exports including lower rate of interests on bank loans, duty drawbacks and exemption from value-added and other taxes. All this has helped reduce policy-induced anti-export biases. Between 1991\u201392 and 2004\u201305 the un-weighted average rate of tariff fell from 70 percent to 13.5 percent. A drastic reduction in unweighted tariff rates during the 1990s also resulted in the fall in import-weighted tariff rates which declined from 42.1 percent in 1990\u201391 to 11.5 percent in 2003\u201304. In 1991\u201392, average industrial and agricultural tariff rates were 73 percent and 76 percent respectively. However, there has been greater reduction in tariff rates for the industrial sector during that period which resulted in average industrial tariff to be 26.7 percent as against 39.7 percent average agricultural tariff rate in 2003\u201304 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Raihan, 2008</a>).",

Other nominal variables, such as transfers and the minimal level of consumption in the LES function, and government savings, current account balance also increase at the same rate. An adjustment variable, which is introduced in the investment demand function, helps in bringing the equality between total savings and total investment in each period. The model allows all variables in the baseline to increase at the same rate in level, and the prices remain constant. This method is useful for the welfare and poverty analysis since all prices remain constant along the business as usual (BAU) path.",

The variations in consumption for each household group from the dynamic model are applied to generate new consumption vectors for individual households from the Bangladeshi household survey. Two different poverty lines for rural and urban households are used, which are endogenously determined by the model taking into account the rural and urban CPIs. Changes in poverty indexes are determined by changes in the poverty line and changes in nominal consumption (or income). The poverty line represents the cost of a basic-needs basket of goods. If the change in poverty line is greater (smaller) than the change in nominal consumption, then poverty is likely to decrease (increase).",

The impacts on GDP and welfare illustrate the importance of analyzing trade liberalization in a dynamic framework; both measures decline in the short run (2008) and then strongly increase in the long run (2020) compared to the business-as-usual (BaU) simulation. The short-run negative impact is explained by the fact that trade liberalization contracts the import-competing and highly protected sectors, and capital cannot be quickly reallocated to the expanding export-oriented sectors. Positive growth is observed in the domestic terms of trade (TOT, the ratio of export to import prices on domestic markets) in both the short run and the long run, given the decline in domestic import prices. Imports and exports register strong positive growth, particularly in the long run. Reduced domestic import prices lead to a fall in consumer prices for both rural and, slightly more, urban households. Skilled and unskilled wage rates decline, although less so in the long run when capital is reallocated toward the expanding sectors. The reduction in unskilled wage rates is somewhat smaller, given the expansion of unskilled labour\u2013intensive textile and garment sectors.

Export-intensive ready-made garments benefit from export expansion, and all these sectors register input cost savings, as evidenced by the positive evolution in value added prices despite falling output prices. Greatly increased import competition for textiles is offset by increased input demand from the ready-made garments sector. In contrast, production contracts in the heavier manufacturing sectors for which export demand stagnates or declines. As a result, non-agricultural capital and labour migrate to the textile and garments sectors and away from the other manufacturing sectors, with relatively little movement in the agricultural sectors. In the long run, the non-agricultural capital stock response is much larger and tempers the reallocation of skilled and unskilled labour. There are also moderate capital stock increases in the agricultural and service sectors.",

Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) poverty measures (<a href=\"#bib2\">Foster <i>et al</i>., 1984</a>) are applied in this study. The FGT indices allow us to compare three measures of poverty: head count ratio, poverty gap index and squared poverty gap index. In the short run, the poverty head-count increases for all households, except those headed by highly educated heads, for which there is no change, and those headed by illiterate heads, for which poverty falls. Also the depth of poverty and the severity of poverty increase in the short run. However, in the long run, poverty indices fall dramatically for all households, especially among the poorer households.
