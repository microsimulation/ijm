The paper also attempts to identify where the potential is for new areas of development in spatial microsimulation models, based on the author\u2019s reading of the spatial microsimulation landscape in 2018. The methods outlined in this paper are identified as significant developments in the field, and include a number of new methods for calculating or adding indicators to a spatial microsimulation model; as well as new methods of validation and estimating confidence intervals. Potential new areas of research include further development of methods for calculating confidence intervals; work on getting spatial microsimulation into the mainstream of policy analysis; work on linking models to provide input into managing complex problems in society; and work on using big data in spatial microsimulation models.",

The process iterates until the weights sum to all of the benchmark tables to some level of accuracy.

This approach is similar to IPF, but instead of exactly summing the weights to a known marginal total, an element of error is incorporated into the calculation. This reduces overfitting problems with IPF when using sparse populations, and by introducing a measure of uncertainty, a measure of quality can be produced. The P-MEDM approach also requires knowledge of the variance in the benchmark tables to estimate this error. <a href=\"#bib39\">Rose &amp; Nagle (2017)</a> fit the P-MEDM model to estimate infant mortality for Bangladesh, using the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) and Census data for the benchmark tables.

The authors consider that some of this may be due to the external survey being very different to the survey used in the spatial microsimulation method, and raise concerns about the accuracy of both surveys. Their overall conclusion is that it is possible to produce accurate small area estimates using the P-MEDM approach, under the important provision that the analyst understands the limitations of the data and sampling method used in the survey. The method is likely to fail when producing any estimate of a small or rare population that is not adequately sampled in the survey; so like IPF, it still struggles with sparse populations.

Fenton compares an IPF using a household only (single level) model; a multilevel model; and then a third refinement to IPF which uses a survey of personal incomes (SPI) for local areas to adjust the start weight for the IPF so that it reflects the relative probability of an adult with that income being selected from the distribution of incomes in the local area.",

This approach can either start with a random sample of people (with replacement) from a survey who are assigned to specific areas using some basic benchmarks like age, sex, etc.; or can start with a null population in each area, using the FBS approach to add households. The approach calculates two fitness values for each household in the seed data (the survey being used to create the synthetic population), one for if adding the household into the synthetic population would reduce the error; and one for if removing it would reduce the error. Once the fitness values have been calculated, one household is randomly selected from those that have positive FBS values and this household is added or removed from the synthetic population. The fitness values are then recalculated; and the process continues. The process iterates until no households have positive values for either of the two fitness values (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ma &amp; Srinivasan, 2015b</a>). This process has also been implemented to create a synthetic population from a weighted population (<a href=\"#bib16\">Esteban Munoz, 2016</a>), calculated using the GREGWT procedure, a reweighting program which uses a generalised regression model (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tanton, Vidyattama, Nepal, &amp; McNamara, 2011</a>).",

Wicked problems require social, economic and environmental approaches to be combined in order to provide information to policy makers and politicians on policies that may assist in resolving these problems, rather than offering isolated solutions to them. By providing a single numeric result, the current range of spatial microsimulation models encourage the user to say that this is what will happen when this policy is introduced \u2013 for example, poverty rates will go down in one area and up in another area. But these results typically look at changes in income with no behavioural change, no social change, and no environmental change.

Once labour force decisions (for example) are brought into a model, complexity, and the number of assumptions increase, making confidence intervals larger.

This is not limited to spatial microsimulation modellers, nor to microsimulation modellers, and the view is not held by all modellers. It is also a generalisation made by the author, who has crossed from being a policy analyst to being a modeller in the University system. Modellers need to recognise that the political process is not just about evidence from one source, but evidence from a number of sources, budget restrictions, voter preferences, and political negotiation. At the end of the day, the results from our models feed into all this, but as the previous section on wicked problems has made clear, it is more complex than just using the results from one model. Mike Batty, a prominent spatial scientist in the UK who has been involved in modelling for cities since the late 60\u2019s, puts this succinctly (and proves that the previous comment is a generalisation) when he writes:",
