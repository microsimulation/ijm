However many of the barriers mentioned have been gradually overcome in the last decade. This paper surveys the development and practices in dynamic microsimulation over the past decade, and discusses the methodological challenges today. It provides an overview of the methodological choices made in more than 60 known dynamic microsimulation models and examines the advantages and disadvantages of different practices. In addition, this paper reviews the main progress made in the field and explores how future microsimulation models could evolve potentially.",

Most dynamic microsimulation models that have developed in following decades trace a direct or indirect link back to this model. Urban planners use microsimulation techniques to estimate traffic flows, while in the field of economics and social science, microsimulation is often used to analyse the social economic policies. In this paper we shall review how dynamic microsimulation in social science has developed, with main focuses on the economic models developed in the past decade.",

In order to evaluate certain impacts of public policies, e.g. the redistributive impact over the course of a lifetime, it is necessary to utilise a long panel dataset. In general, such datasets are not available, either because the analysis relates to the future, as in the case of pension forecasts, or because collected datasets do not cover sufficiently long time periods; therefore, analysts use dynamic microsimulation models to assist in their analysis, a concept which was initially suggested by Orcutt in <a href=\"#bib128\">1957</a>. Essentially, microsimulation is a tool to generate synthetic micro-unit based data, which can then be used to answer many \u201cwhat-if\u201d questions that, otherwise, cannot be answered.",

Some newer static models, e.g. IZA\u03a8MOD (<a href=\"#bib135\">Peichl <i>et al</i>., 2010</a>), improved the traditional model by incorporating certain behaviour responses assuming the market adjusts to the new steady state overnight. Dynamic models, e.g. DESTINIE, PENSIM, and SESIM (<a href=\"#bib18\">Bardaji <i>et al</i>., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Curry, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Flood, 2007</a>), extend the static model by allowing individuals to change their characteristics due to endogenous factors within the model (<a href=\"#bib122\">O\u2019Donoghue, 2001a</a>) and let individual units to progress over time.

However, many of the barriers that existed for model development back in 2001 have been overcome. Data collection projects such as the European Community Household Panel and the increased availability of longitudinal administrative data such as the Lifetime Labour Market Database in the UK have loosened the data constraints. A number of new models were developed in the past decade, for instance Pensim2 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Emmerson <i>et al</i>., 2004</a>), IFS Model (<a href=\"#bib25\">Brewer <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>) and SAGE (<a href=\"#bib169\">Zaidi &amp; Rake, 2001</a>) models in UK, APPSIM in Australia (<a href=\"#bib77\">Harding, 2007a</a>) and DESTINIE2 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Blanchet <i>et al</i>., 2009</a>) in France etc. Meanwhile, a few generic software programmes have emerged, such as ModGen (<a href=\"#bib166\">Wolfson &amp; Rowe, 1998</a>), UMDBS (<a href=\"#bib141\">Sauerbier, 2002</a>), GENESIS (<a href=\"#bib52\">Edwards, 2004</a>) and LIAM (<a href=\"#bib125\">O\u2019Donoghue <i>et al</i>., 2009</a>), eliminating the need to create a model from scratch. It has allowed an internationalisation of the models with developments in Belgium (<a href=\"#bib46\">Dekkers &amp; Belloni, 2009</a>), Italy (<a href=\"#bib47\">Dekkers <i>et al</i>., 2010</a>), Canada (<a href=\"#bib147\">Spielauer, 2009</a>), UK (<a href=\"#bib55\">Emmerson <i>et al</i>., 2004</a>) etc. Nevertheless, the decade has seen the demise of a number of models such as DYNACAN in Canada, CORSIM in U.S., NEDYMAS (<a href=\"#bib48\">Dekkers <i>et al</i>., 1993</a>) in the Netherlands, the Belgian model (<a href=\"#bib90\">Joyeux <i>et al</i>., 1996</a>) and MIDAS in New Zealand etc. The micro-econometric and micro-economic understandings of the processes that make up a dynamic microsimulation model have also greatly improved over this period.

Because the data is often collected for taxations or law enforcement purpose, the data could be very accurate for some variables, e.g. employee earnings, but very misleading in certain self-reported information, e.g. household wealth. Since the administrative data collection is a government initiative, some information that is useful for social economic researchers may not be included. For this reason, models using administrative data often seek to supplement information from external sources, such in the case of Sweden (SESIM model) where certain variables were imputed based on a survey.",

However, household survey datasets may have the issues of smaller sample size and weights adjustment. The use of weights in a dynamic model adds complexity to many areas and can result in individuals being given different weightings at different points in their lives. As microsimulation aims at inference to a finite population, one solution, as implemented in the DYNAMITE, is to replicate household population according to their weights, so that consequently each household has the same basic weight. However, there is limited understanding on how the use of weight would affect the final outcomes of simulation models.",

Hybrid sources of datasets are often used in such scenario, whereby a combination of datasets from various sources, statistical matching and simulation techniques are utilised, for instance DYNASIM3 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Favreault &amp; Smith, 2004</a>) matches two survey datasets, namely, Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID).

In addition, some models focus only on adults (i.e. ignore children) and thus, although these models may contain a cross-section of the population, they do not represent the entire age spectrum. In many cases, only persons born within a particular year are included in the model.

The method typically features less micro-units interactions as compared with a full-fledged population model. Both types of models can be simulated in the same modelling environment: a cohort model is simply a model that ages a sample of individuals in a particular age group, while a population model ages a sample of individuals of different ages.

There are two types of ageing processes; static ageing and dynamic ageing. Static ageing, as described in <a href=\"#bib87\">Immervoll <i>et al</i>. (2005)</a>, is a method that attempts to align the available micro-data with other known future information (such as changes in population aggregates, age distributions or unemployment rates), without modelling the processes that drive these changes (e.g., migration, fertility, or economic downturn). For example, in order to simulate an ageing society, the weighting of young people gradually decreases over time while the weighting of elderly people would increase; however, there is no change to the attributes of these individuals. Dynamic ageing by contrast, changes the attributes of the individuals instead of altering their weights. In the same example of simulating an ageing society, models with dynamic ageing will update the age and other related attributes of individuals over time instead of changing their weights. The method can be referred as cross-sectional dynamic ageing if all individuals are updated before a model moves on to the next time period in a dynamic ageing process, or longitudinal dynamic ageing if a model simulates all time periods for one individual before repeating the same process for the next one in the population. Dynamic ageing is generally more popular and may sometimes be used as the criteria to judge whether a model belongs to the camp of dynamic microsimulation models<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup>.",

In many cases, the only variable that needs to be changed over time is the weight of the observations. Dekkers and Van Camp (<a href=\"#bib49\">2011</a>) noted that this might be attractive for modellers who already have a static microsimulation model, however, static ageing also has a number of disadvantages. <a href=\"#bib97\">Klevmarken (1997)</a> highlighted that whereas static ageing may avoid some problems of drift in the projected cross-section associated with dynamic ageing because of misspecification in dynamic equations, it cannot account for mobility between states. In addition, he pointed out that from a statistical point of view, it is inefficient not to use all available historical information to project into the future. A consequence of not modelling the mobility of individuals between points in time is that it reduces the type of analyses that can be undertaken by a microsimulation model, for example, it is not possible to conduct analyses that require life event histories such as the simulation of pensions. Furthermore, future weights need to be forecast in order to age a dataset. Although macro models or other forecasting devices can be used they may not forecast weights at the level of detail required. Besides, the weight calculation may be further complicated when multiple variables are being considered at the same time<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup>. Generally speaking, static ageing cannot be used where no sample observation is in the particular state of interest. If a particular state is under-represented, a very high weight may have to be applied to the corresponding observations, resulting in unstable predictions. As a result, static ageing procedures are mostly used in short to medium term forecasts of approximately 3\u20135 years, where it can be expected that large changes would not occurred in the underlying population. However, it may be more difficult to use static ageing over longer periods of time due to changing characteristics of the population.",

Cross-sectional dynamic ageing is the most common method while longitudinal ageing is sometimes used in cohort models. Dynamic ageing can consistently estimate characteristics of future income distributions under ideal circumstances in which all transition probabilities and state specific expectations can be estimated consistently. This may be possible in a simple model with a small number of processes, but in a fully dynamic model of work and life histories, many more processes need to be jointly estimated, a formidable requirement given the available data. Therefore, it might be necessary to make some assumptions to make estimation feasible, e.g. education choice happens before labour participation choice etc. In addition, one may also need to assume independent error terms and some other arbitrary assumptions in order to simplify the estimation. Although these assumptions are common in practice, they may lead to theoretical pitfalls and biased results when excessively used without proper testing. In addition, projections over time at the micro-level are particularly susceptible to misspecification error as modelling at this level involves more detail than in macro models, also current knowledge regarding micro-behaviour is not good enough to specify a fully dynamic model. As a result, dynamic ageing combined with an alignment (calibration) mechanism to keep aggregate outputs in line with predictions from macro models is commonly used. The method allows individual transitions to be simulated as well as ensuring that aggregate outputs on track with macro forecasts (see, for examples, <a href=\"#bib33\">Ch\u00e9nard 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">2001</a>).",

For example if the time period is a year, this approach rules out transitions in and out of unemployment over the course of a year, which is unrealistic, as many people will have unemployment transitions for periods of less than one year as in the case of seasonal workers. Therefore, the discrete time transitions simulate net transitions (see <a href=\"#bib67\">Galler, 1997</a>) at discrete points in time, ignoring the transition path taken to reach the end state. Some models, e.g. MICROHUS and SESIM, therefore developed a workaround where the end state is stimulated together with an extra variable describing the transition. Take unemployment as an example, the method simulates both the employment status (end state) and the length of unemployment, which can be used to partially describe the transition with greater details.",

Given that most base datasets were collected yearly and many taxation procedures are reviewed annually, it is easier to incorporate a discrete time framework. Although a continuous time model could simulate the sequence of event occurrences, it still faces the estimation problems of interdependent processes and correlated errors. In addition, the potential interdependence of transitions for members (e.g. family) further raises the complexity of implementation.

The existence of an alignment mechanism may constrain model outputs to always hit aggregate targets even if there has been an underlying behavioural or structural change. An example would be if education levels rose, as this would be expected to reduce mortality rates and increase female labour force participation. If the alignment mechanism for each process did not incorporate the impact of educational achievement, then an increase in the education level would have no effect on these aggregates.

The complexity of a model, as a result, often comes from the constructions of the economic models and is mostly guided by the potential policy questions that the model is required to answer. Models focusing on pension issues usually simulate detailed labour market behaviour for decades ahead, as a change in the pension system can only mature when the youngest cohort in the labour market retires. In contrast, short term tax policy models usually forward simulate 3 to 5 years and are typically limited to tax related variables only.

This argument is also widely known as Lucas\u2019 critique. As a result, structural models are usually seen as a better choice. Since some part of the policies (e.g. tax) can be explicitly included in the structural model, the estimated utility parameters are perceived to be more stable (<a href=\"#bib101\">Klevmarken &amp; Lindgren, 2008</a>), although utility parameters can sometimes be very sensitive to even a small change in the model specification.

However, these models invariably incorporate historical information such as macro-aggregates into the model and as this information would not have been known to forecasters, this may produce better forecasts than would have otherwise been the case. One method to overcome this is to compare directly generated forecasts with what happened in reality, for example comparing forecasted labour participation rates with actual rates. Another method described by <a href=\"#bib29\">Caldwell (1996)</a> is to use an indirect approach, known as a multiple module approach.

SAGE, DYNAMOD, LIAM, DYNACAN and a few others models were all developed using C++, whilst POLISIM used a mixture of C and C++, and APPSIM and MOSART were programmed in C#. Models have also been developed in Java (e.g. IFSIM), Visual Basic (e.g. SESIM) and a number of other languages. Evaluation based on the prototype microsimulation models by <a href=\"#bib136\">Percival (2007)</a> suggested that there is a substantial speed advantage when the prototype model is coded using C++. However, the cost of development is much higher when compared with other approaches, as all the potential numeric calculations and related data management need to be programmed. In practice, it is likely that policy modellers are not adequately proficient in programming, while professional programmers may not fully understand the economic theories and scientific principles that are to be implemented.",

Another major advancement in the past decades is the emerge of generic models, including Modgen (<a href=\"#bib166\">Wolfson &amp; Rowe, 1998</a>), UMDBS (<a href=\"#bib141\">Sauerbier, 2002</a>), GENESIS (<a href=\"#bib52\">Edwards, 2004</a>), LIAM (<a href=\"#bib125\">O\u2019Donoghue <i>et al</i>., 2009</a>) and LIAM2 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Bryon <i>et al</i>., 2011</a>). These generic models can greatly reduce the workload of new modellers by providing commonly used microsimulation routines.",

In addition, microsimulation models are mostly developed in governmental or policy institutions, where developing a literature on which a wider group of scientists has built has been a lesser objective. Furthermore, the documents are mainly spread with limited books and conference presentations, which may not be easily available for researchers outside of the network. Additionally, academic publication relies on preparing papers of 5 to 10 thousand words, which may not be enough for complex dynamic microsimulation models. Thus a significant proportion of the extensive methods used in the field are not formally codified, meaning that to a large extent new models have had to reinvent the wheel and redevelop existing methods over and over again.
