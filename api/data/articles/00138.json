Using spatial microsimulation and GIS methods we create a spatially rich dataset for each year which is then used to create a spatial distribution of disposable income. The period covered in this paper is an important time in Ireland\u2019s history and this paper takes a spatial perspective on the significant changes in the landscape of disposable income. By adopting this approach we can examine if there are clear disparities between different areas of the country. From our results we have showed that there are significant differences in how regions have performed during this period 1996\u20132011. The major urban centres and hubs have outperformed the rural areas in terms of levels of disposable income. Even amongst urban areas, Dublin has outperformed all other areas becoming an outlier such is the difference in levels of disposable income. The Celtic Tiger, Property Bubble and Great Recession have all impacted on the different regions in different ways.",

The Celtic Tiger (1995\u20132006) was a period of strong economic growth largely due to FDI. Real GDP growth averaged 10% a year (<a href=\"#bib20\">Honohan &amp; Walsh, 2002</a>). This period saw significant growth in the CPI. In the period 1996\u20132002, CPI grew by 18%, from 2002\u20132006 by 11% and 2006\u20132011 by 6%. Overall the CPI increased in the period 1996\u20132011 by 31%. The property bubble (2001\u20132007) saw house prices increase rapidly due to a combination of factors including; Government policy, banks\u2019 lending practices and media coverage (<a href=\"#bib14\">Donovan &amp; Murphy, 2013</a>). House prices more than quadrupled between 1995\u20132007 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kanda, 2010</a>). A combination of the global financial crisis and collapse of the property market caused Ireland to enter a deep recession with GDP decreasing by 8% in 2009 alone (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kanda, 2010</a>). The so called \u201cGreat Recession\u201d was felt more strongly in Ireland due to double shocks hitting at the same time (global financial crisis and collapse of property market). In the space of four years unemployment more than doubled (2007\u20134.7%, 2011\u201314.6%) and net government debt increased 8 fold (2007\u201310% of GDP, 2011\u201381% of GDP), primarily through bank bailouts. This is in contrast to the period 1994\u20132004 where growth in real GNP was over 6% on average. In the same period unemployment fell from 15% to under 5% (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barrett &amp; McCarthy, 2007</a>). <a href=\"#bib46\">Whelan (2013)</a>, give a nice overview of the macroeconomic background in Ireland over the period 1988\u20132013, which additionally notes the impact of austerity measures on incomes.

However there was a lack of commitment to the strategy which saw it viewed as a document offering advice to policymakers and planners (<a href=\"#bib28\">Meredith &amp; Van Egeraat, 2013</a>). Another issue was the selection of the \u201cgateways\u201d and \u201chubs\u201d. There was disagreement over the selection of some cities and towns over others. It was seen as \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d type selection policy (<a href=\"#bib13\">Daly &amp; Kitchin, 2013</a>). The CEDRA report (<a href=\"#bib9\">CEDRA, 2013</a>) detailed specific recommendations on how to improve rural areas.

Spatial Microsimulation has a number of advantages over published aggregate totals. It can be linked to other datasets, can be spatially disaggregated or aggregated, data is stored as lists and the models developed can be updated (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ballas <i>et al.</i>, 2006</a>). Normally there is a lack of income data contained in small area census data; however there is detailed additional spatial information. The opposite is true of survey data; it contains data on income but has poor spatial detail. Spatial microsimulation helps in overcoming these problems. This paper uses the output from the SMILE model. SMILE is a static microsimulation model (<a href=\"#bib31\">Morrissey <i>et al.</i>, 2013</a>) which has been developed by the Rural Economic Development Programme, Teagasc and the School of Geography at the University of Leeds (<a href=\"#bib29\">Morrissey <i>et al.</i>, 2008</a>). The SMILE model aids in creating a spatially disaggregated population micro-dataset with detailed income and spatial information. It does this by matching overlapping variables between the census and survey datasets (<a href=\"#bib29\">Morrissey <i>et al</i>., 2008</a>). SMILE uses quota sampling (QS), which is a probabilistic reweighting method (<a href=\"#bib15\">Farrell <i>et al.</i>, 2012</a>). It works by firstly randomly ordering the micro data, it then samples from the micro data until the quotas \u2013 which are set by the constraint variables from the census \u2013 are filled. This data is then calibrated to ensure that the data is representative. Once calibration has been performed, SMILE presents us with a dataset which contains market income as well as other demographic information at the electoral district (ED) level for each individual in the population.",

The SMILE model also takes into account the complex nature of the tax-benefit system. Income is modelled net of taxes and benefits. In order to do so a static microsimulation model of the Irish tax-benefit system was developed. In Ireland a number of similar models have been developed such as the SWITCH model (<a href=\"#bib6\">Callan <i>et al.</i>, 1996</a>) as part of a European tax-benefit model (<a href=\"#bib35\">O\u2019Donoghue, 1998</a>). A simplified Tax-Benefit microsimulation model was programmed in Stata to model the spatial distribution of income net of taxes and benefits. This model is consistent with other publicly available models such as EUROMOD. SWITCH is not publicly available. The tax-benefit system is simulated for each of the census years. For a technical overview of the process please refer to (<a href=\"#bib33\">O\u2019Donoghue <i>et al.</i>, 2013</a>). This component of the SMILE model is important as the distribution of our disposable income measure relies upon, not only the distribution.",

In 2006 the number of EDs outside of Dublin in the top quintile has reduced even further. <a href=\"#table5\">Table 5</a> shows that population density in the top quintile is also increasing. This suggests Dublin City has become even more concentrated. It is attracting high levels of people in search of better opportunities. The south-west of the country has also seen an increase in the number in top quintile. While again the urban-rural divide is quite stark. Much of the centre and north of the map remains in the bottom quintiles. These areas are characterised by low population density, low levels of third level education and high unemployment.

Levels of education have increased over time; even those in the bottom quintile have seen the percentage of adults with third level education increase.

The Thiel index decomposes inequality into two components between and within variability. We can see that much of the variability is occurring within rather than between EDs. Although our maps show that there is a changing landscape across Ireland much of this change is occurring within EDs rather than between them. An examination of the tabulations of income by area shows that to be the case. Within an area we cannot say definitively whether an ED has more individuals in one particular quintile on the income distribution.",

The trends are worrying and have already led to a housing crisis particularly in the GDA. This crisis was inevitable given the increasing wages and property prices in these areas. Our Thiel index results show the high levels of inequality within rather than between EDs. Within an ED there are vast differences in income. Dublin has proven attractive to those with high levels of education who demand a higher wage. This has led to people converging on Dublin hence the increasing population density over time. Policy should look at addressing this issue by improving job opportunities in medium to small sized towns. This could be achieved by improving the infrastructure in these areas to bring them in line with the facilities etc. available in a major urban centre such as Dublin.",

Attractive living conditions; good services, high wages; have led to permanent differences in the wage and unemployment rate. It is difficult for income to increase in an area of high unemployment due to the excess in labour supply. The districts with the lowest incomes also tend to be the districts with the highest levels of unemployment. There is a spatial concentration of those most at risk of poverty. Increased investment in public housing in areas where there are better opportunities is one method of supporting the movement of people out of high poverty areas. Government subsidies can make it affordable for them to live in more prosperous regions and areas.",
