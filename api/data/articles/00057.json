Australia has a universal social insurance scheme known as \u2018Medicare\u2019 which provides all Australians with access to free or low-cost essential medical services. These services are provided primarily by general practitioners as well as specialist doctors but also include diagnostic and imaging services. Individuals may pay a direct out-of pocket contribution if fees charged for services are higher than the reimbursement schedule set by government. HealthMod is based on the Australian 2001 National Health Survey. This survey had a number of deficiencies in terms of modelling the national medical benefits scheme. The article outlines three major methodological steps that had to be taken in the model construction: the imputation of synthetic families, the imputation of short-term health conditions, and the annualisation of doctor visits and costs. Some preliminary results on the use of doctor services subsidised through Australia\u2019s Medicare are presented.",

Over the past decade, the growth rate in total health expenditure has far outstripped growth in Australia\u2019s GDP (<a href=\"#bib6\">AIHW, 2007</a>). In 2005\u201306, government funding on medical services was $Aus12.2bn, representing 22.2 per cent of total government recurrent expenditure on health. This expenditure was matched by funding from non-government sources of $3.3bn. Between 1998\u201399 and 2008\u201309, the average annual real growth in total recurrent expenditure on medical services in Australia was 3.5 percent (AIHW, 2010).

The 2001 NHS contains information about the health of Australians, including the presence of long-term health conditions, health risk factors and health service usage, along with a range of demographic and socio-economic information. However, the 2001 survey had a number of major deficiencies in terms of modelling Australia\u2019s Medicare scheme. So, whilst the 2001 NHS was chosen as the starting point for the basefile of HealthMod due to its rich health data, it was evident that supplementation of these data was required. This paper outlines three major methodological steps that had to be taken in the model\u2019s construction: the imputation of synthetic families; the imputation of short-term health conditions; and the annualisation of doctor visits and costs. Before these technical aspects of the modelling are discussed, brief overviews of Medicare, the NHS and approaches to statistical matching are provided in the next section as background. Some preliminary results on the use of doctor services and the benefits (payments) provided through Medicare are presented as validation of the model construction undertaken to date.",

In 2001, Australia\u2019s NHPAs were cardiovascular disease, cancer, injury, mental health, diabetes, and arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions. These contributed most to the burden of illness in Australia, and were regarded as having potential to respond to policy (<a href=\"#bib4\">ABS, 2003a</a>). To enable the prevalence of all long-term conditions to be established, supplementary information was also collected on other long-term non-NHPA conditions.

Since this involves sample surveys (rather than administrative data or a census), the aim of the matching was to find the closest statistical match. Statistical matching is a procedure used to link two or more data files where each record from a file is matched with a record from a second file that generally does not represent the same unit, but does represent a similar unit. It is a method to bring together microdata that are not available from a single data source (<a href=\"#bib20\">Radner et al 1980</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">Rodgers, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cohen, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Moriarty &amp; Scheuren, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Rassler, 2002</a>). There are a number of processes available for statistically matching datasets and generating synthetic microdata. The method adopted in HealthMod was distance-based record linkage using the Mahalanobis distance function (McLachlan, 1999; Bedrick et al, 2000; <a href=\"#bib26\">Torra et al, 2006</a>). This is distinct from two other commonly used approaches of iterative proportional fitting (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ballas &amp; Clarke, 2000</a>; Simpson and Tanner, 2004) and simulating annealing (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ballas et al, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ballas et al, 2007</a>).",

If there are more than one X variable to be used in the matching then these variables must assume some weight i.e. importance in the Mahalanobis distance function. These weights can be assigned subjectively, or can come from a regression or factor analysis. The Mahalanobis distance function was used as it accounts for unequal variances as well as correlations between the common variables. It takes the different scales of the common variables into consideration by dividing the individual differences by the standard deviation of each variable. Without this adjustment, some variables may be penalized purely due to the scale of the variable and not its importance in the matching process. Better performance of the distance function occurs if the linking X variables chosen are continuous or ordinal variables.",

Three key problems and the methods designed to overcome them are discussed below. First, as indicated above, the 2001 survey only partially enumerates households. The ABS therefore recommends that any analysis of the 2001 file be undertaken at the person level only (<a href=\"#bib3\">ABS, 2003</a>). To model the different aspects of Medicare complete information about all family members, their combined health service use and their combined income/medical expenditure is required. Second, the survey has very limited coverage of recent illness. Analysis of the 1995 NHS indicates that around 70 per cent of general practitioner visits in Australia are prompted by short-term health problems. The lack of coverage of short-term illnesses is a major limitation since these conditions need to be adequately captured in the base file. Third, doctor usage is being modelled within HealthMod with health conditions as an explanatory variable. Hence, the annual picture of the presence of health conditions is also required. The 2001 NHS uses a two-week window for reporting the use of medical and related services. To model the impact of policy, such as the MBS safety net, an annual picture of doctor visits and use of other medical services such as diagnostic procedures, diagnostic imaging and pathology services is required. To address these issues, we produced an augmented dataset by creating synthetic families through statistical matching, imputing short-term conditions and annualising medical services covered under the MBS.",

It assumes that Y (e.g. the health variables on the NHS) and Z (e.g. the household income and medical expenditure variables on STINMOD/01A), given X (the common demographic variables) are independent. Cohen 1991 (p74) explains: \u201cRecords from two files are matched or not matched on the basis of the values of X (in file A and file B). Therefore, there is no additional information in the matched file about the relationship between X and Y and between X and Z that is not explained by the relationships between X and Y and between X and Z.\u201d However, because all the variables are not observed together, this assumption cannot be tested (except if an auxiliary dataset containing all variables of interest was available). The confidence that can be felt about a match is highly dependent on the correlation of the common variables to the health variables on the NHS side and the income/expenditure variables on the STINMOD/01A side. Bringing across the detailed income and medical expenditure data from the STINMOD/01A file was problematic. Therefore the matching focussed on adding family structure. Using the family allocation from STINMOD/01A had less reliance on the assumption of conditional independence as it only borrowed from the common demographic variables and the analysis did not use joint distributions. Nevertheless the 2001 NHS did have income data that was available to the model although not as detailed as that contained in STINMOD/01A.",

The 2003\u201304 annual survey of activities undertaken in general practice showed that, whilst not as large a proportion, health problems of a non-chronic nature accounted for 65.3 per cent of problems treated by a GP (<a href=\"#bib11\">Britt et al, 2004</a>).

The ABS definition of a short-term health condition is any health condition that lasted for less than 6 months or was not likely to last for six months. Conversely, a long-term health condition is any health condition that has lasted for longer than 6 months or was likely to last for more than 6 months. The information about health conditions is self-reported and any inaccuracy caused by this must be kept in mind.

In general, the model slightly underestimated the prevalence of short-term health conditions. In terms of comparing the demographic profile of those who were allocated to have various conditions to the demographic profile of the 1995 NHS, only two condition groups (injury and poisoning, and preventative) did not perform reasonably well based on a mean cell absolute difference of less than 5 (to summarise these results the absolute mean error for each level in the variable was summed to give the sum of absolute difference and the average cell absolute difference across the variable levels was calculated). These two conditions appear to have undergone the most change in the five years between 1995 and 2001. The distribution of the number of short-term health conditions experienced per person in a two week period was very similar between the 1995 NHS and the HealthMod imputation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). However, the number of persons without a short-term health condition was 28.8 per cent in HealthMod compared with 21.3 per cent in 1995 NHS data.",

The model performed equally well when the number of doctor visits was examined by age and gender. The main reason allocated for the last visit to a doctor was preventative (1.02 million, 22.5 per cent), followed by respiratory conditions (0.66m; 14.6 per cent) and other musculoskeletal conditions (0.48m; 10.7 per cent) (<a href=\"#table9\">Table 9</a>).

The quality of the matching is dependent on the variables constrained in the matching process. These variables need to reflect the aim of the matching. For HealthMod, the emphasis was on trying to get family structure in terms of income unit type and income levels as close as possible to reported distributions. The statistical matching allowed the retention of the health information available on 2001 NHS whilst borrowing the family structure from another national survey. Overall, the synthetic families created through the statistical matching are of a sufficient quality to provide confidence in the income unit level analyses.",
