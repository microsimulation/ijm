First, as both net and gross incomes are reported in SILC, implicit tax rates are calculated and evaluated. In a second step, gross incomes from SILC are compared with gross incomes reported on the fiscal form for the same individuals. Finally, we make use of EUROMOD to re-calibrate SILC gross incomes in order to make them consistent with the reported net ones. We find that, on average, fiscally reported gross incomes exceed gross incomes in the SILC survey. It is not clear however whether the re-calibration method (whereby we use an iterative method to construct adjusted SILC gross incomes starting from the observed net ones) is a genuine improvement upon the reported gross income distribution.",

As they constitute an important pillar for research and policy making, it is all the more alarming that the quality of surveys seems to be declining (<a href=\"#bib9\">Meyer <i>et al</i>., 2015</a>). They name three reasons for this trend. First, households are increasingly less willing to take part in surveys, leading to an increase in so called unit non-response. Second, they cannot or do not want to provide the answer to specific questions, leading to item non-response. And third, when they do answer, the answer is often inaccurate, leading to measurement error. The growing availability of administrative data fuels the debate on whether or not to supplement selected survey variables with administrative data, or to even replace survey data entirely by administrative data. Proponents argue that such reforms would save up interview time and may lead to more robust results, as administrative data does not suffer from selective non-response and erroneous reporting (<a href=\"#bib4\">Epland, 2006</a>). But administrative data suffers from inherent shortcomings as well, as it cannot take tax evasion into account (in the case of data from tax forms), and they often measure a slightly different concept than the measure from the survey (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abowd &amp; Stinson., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">Kapteyn &amp; Ypman, 2007</a>).",

In this study, the quality of the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) data is assessed, both measuring the dataset\u2019s internal consistency through a comparison of gross and net incomes, and by comparing gross incomes with their identical match in the administrative (or register) data. We dispose of a unique dataset which combines tax return data (the IPCAL dataset) with survey data for the individuals included in the SILC survey.",

In <a href=\"#s3\">Section 3</a>, we compare gross SILC incomes with its administrative counterparts. This comparison reveals that gross incomes in SILC are underreported compared to the ones in the administrative IPCAL data.

In that case it seems natural to start from these reported net incomes to reconstruct \u2018corrected\u2019 gross incomes. This method is explained in <a href=\"#s4\">Section 4</a>. Finally, in <a href=\"#s5\">Section 5</a>, the distribution of newly calculated SILC gross incomes is compared with the gross incomes from the administrative dataset to check whether an improvement in the correspondence between SILC and IPCAL datasets is notable.

Socio-demographic information is combined with an array of income components at the level of the individual and the household. The Belgian version of EU-SILC (BE-SILC) is more detailed than the European one and will be used in this paper.

Net income is the sum of gross income after social insurance contributions (excl. employer contributions) and personal income taxes.

This implies that reported gross incomes are either too high or net incomes are too low, or both. As the Belgian tax system includes many tax reductions, it is much harder to conclude anything for implicit tax rates that are below the maximum average tax rate.

It is of course possible that the administrative fiscal data contains incomes which are delayed and which should have been received in previous years but have actually been paid out in 2009, the year of the data collection. But, if they have actually been received in 2009, they should also be reported in the survey data as received in 2009.

They often have small amounts of gross employee income (median of 2,237 euro and a mean of 13,100 euro, which points to a strongly right skewed distribution). It is possible that respondents in SILC forget about these small income amounts (e.g. because it is income from an occasional job). 2% have a positive income in SILC exclusively (median of 13,949 euro and a mean of 19,327 euro). Looking at self-employment income, the correspondence between both datasets is pretty low. 567 individuals have a self-employment income in both IPCAL and SILC, 218 in IPCAL only (a median of 3,733 euro and a mean of 8,040 euro) and 307 in SILC only (a median of 23,750 euro and a mean of 29,205 euro). The first mismatch may again be due to small amounts neglected by SILC respondents (an indication for this is the relatively low median income), while the second mismatch may be due to tax evasion (as median income is higher, this might be a plausible explanation). When taking both employee and self-employed gross income together (another possible mismatch is that people make wrong judgements whether they are working as employee or self-employed), we see that 84% of all individuals with work income report this income in both IPCAL and SILC. More than 1,000 individuals report a (relatively small) positive income in IPCAL but not in SILC (median of 1,606 euro and a mean of 5,623 euro).",

When the old-age pension is reported in SILC exclusively, the median is higher (13,200 euro with an average of 14,271 euro). This underreporting of gross old-age pensions in IPCAL may be due to the fact that the amounts of the guaranteed income for the elderly are generally too low for taxes to be applied and are thus not declared to the tax authorities. For survivor pensions, the correspondence between both datasets is low (16%). Most individuals report a survivor pension in SILC but not in IPCAL. It is possible that individuals are not aware whether they receive an old-age pension or a survivor pension.

Also the standard deviation diminishes (from 23,852 to 22,336). Looking at the separate income components, we get a mixed picture: in all cases but one (old-age pensions), the mean difference between SILC and IPCAL diminishes.

The method we use is based on the assumption that SILC respondents have a better knowledge of their net incomes (as reported in SILC) than of their gross ones. The fact that gross incomes are more often imputed in SILC than net incomes (see <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>) supports this argument. In this case, it seems naturel to start from the reported net incomes to reconstruct \u2018corrected\u2019 gross incomes, which are consistent with the reported net ones. Another option is to assume that the administrative gross incomes are the \u2018correct\u2019 ones, and hence replace (some) gross incomes in SILC by the information from IPCAL. A run of EUROMOD on these corrected gross incomes would then produce an adjusted net income distribution, which can be compared with the distribution of reported net incomes in SILC. We will only look at the former option, the latter is left for future research.",

Since the complexity of a real-world tax-benefit system makes it impossible to invert this relationship analytically, one searches for these gross incomes iteratively. Make an informed guess of gross income, run the microsimulation model to calculate the corresponding net income, and compare this net income with the reported net income. Based on that difference, adjust the first guess of your gross income. In this way one produces a gross income distribution which, for a given tax benefit structure and for a given parameterization of this structure in a tax-benefit model, is consistent with observed or reported net incomes. In this case, the assumptions are: 1) that reported net incomes in SILC are more reliable than gross incomes, and 2) we take the accuracy of the microsimulation model, linking gross and net incomes, for granted. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> gives an illustration of the iterative procedure used in this paper.",

These differences can be substantial, certainly for specific income components, such as self-employment income. We then tested some possible reasons for this underreporting of gross incomes in SILC (imputation in SILC, sources used by the SILC respondents and stability of the socio-economic status throughout the year), but none of them gave a satisfactory explanation.",

Another option is to insert additional information on fiscal expenditures into the EUROMOD dataset, as such produce a more accurate calculation of personal income tax liabilities. Since we then would have to expand EUROMOD with new information and also new routines, we leave this for future research. We consider this paper as a first step in a broader investigation of the quality of SILC gross incomes.",
