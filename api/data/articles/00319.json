The documented failure of the tax-benefit system in Ethiopia to account for the significant price increases motivates the consideration of general equilibrium effects. The linkage methodology follows a bottom-up approach, where results from the tax-benefit model feed into the CGE through changes in the average income tax rate. The study shows that \u2013 in addition to boosting government revenues, fiscal drag slightly favoured economic growth in Ethiopia in the mid-2010s, although at the cost of increasing inequality.",

Not only the model is characterised by a broad scope and a large number of state variables that are jointly evolved, but variants are estimated on multiple European countries.

A relatively older paper (<a href=\"#bib1\">Kolkman et al., 2016</a>) offers some insights. They point to 11 criteria, referring to model characteristics (quality, tractability, efficiency and flexibility), supporting infrastructure (compatibility, transparency, consistency), organisational factors (organisational conditions and model advocates), and two others (reputation and stakeholder and user engagement).

They have little ability to influence organizational conditions and the presence of advocates within the organization. Model developers have some, but limited influence over their reputation and the consistency of their model outcomes with established models. This leaves those developing models with six criteria that they can affect and that they should consider carefully if they are seeking model acceptance in government. The six are quality, tractability, efficiency, flexibility, compatibility and participation in development. These six criteria are not typically addressed in publications that present a model and claim usefulness of that model to policymaking. This suggests that the usefulness of models to policymaking cannot be understood in isolation from the social context in which they are used.</i>",

It is important to note that perception seems to be central to model acceptance. While the quality of a model may be established beyond doubt in an academic community, those involved in policy making may not necessarily perceive it equally favourably. These four criteria could be satisfied by involving the client organization in the model development process and investing in model transparency, for instance, by ensuring the availability of model documentation that is written to the appropriate level of expertise and organizing regular opportunities for model developer and user to meet.\u201d</i>",
