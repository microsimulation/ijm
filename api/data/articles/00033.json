We use a \u2018top-down\u2019 approach to combine a static computable general equilibrium model with a microsimulation model. Our results suggest that between 2007 and 2009 the poverty headcount ratio is likely to have increased by almost 80 percent, from 22 to 40 percentage points. However, our results also show that this increase is attributable in part to the fuel and food crisis that preceded the financial crisis. Our results also indicate a differential impact, with wage increases for farm workers and a decrease in wages for skilled labour.",

Second, we use our combined CGE and microsimulation models to simulate the macro-micro impact of a 25 percent decline in external resource inflows (foreign savings). This reflects what has been observed during the financial crisis, leading to a depreciation of the Pakistani Rupee by almost 28 percent.",

Our results estimate that between 2007 and 2009, poverty increased by almost 40 percent. However this is also attributable to the fuel and food crisis that preceded the financial crisis. More recently Pakistan witnessed a sharp reduction in foreign capital inflows on account of the global recession, among other reasons. This led to a sharp depreciation, a decline in investment, falling wages for skilled workers, and a general rise in consumer prices. At the micro level, we estimate that this resulted in a 4 percent increase in poverty with food consumption declining by 1.3 percent.",

Balance of payments weaknesses forced the country to resort to an IMF stand-by arrangement, which imposed further conditionalities on the budget. Subsidies on wheat, electricity, fertilizer and oil had to be phased out, which in turn increased the inflationary burden on the consumer. While there are some social safety nets at the federal and provincial level, access to these has generally become more difficult. Reforms to better target social safety nets are still underway.",
