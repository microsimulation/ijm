This type of difficulty is indeed present and formidable enough. A more basic difficulty is that such aggregation cannot be correctly made without a reasonable model of the same socio-economic system stated in terms of the behavior and interaction of the elemental decision-making units. Then, and only then, could ways be found of aggregating relationships without a disastrous loss of accuracy of representation.",

Now, given the values of <i>X</i> for each of the 100 individuals, it is clear that the sum of the <i>Y</i>\u2019s will have a definite value.

However, a substantial amount of useful regularity is often discovered in the relative proportions in which large numbers of individuals produce alternative outputs under conditions which appear homogeneous. It is, of course, because of this that insurance companies do so well. It is this fact that makes a probabilistic approach seem highly desirable. The use of a probabilistic approach, based upon knowledge similar to that contained in mortality tables, reflects the state of knowledge about small decision-making units. It does not imply much, if anything, about the underlying nature of reality.

Using this approach the model would be simulated on a large electronic machine, such as the IBM 704 or the UNIVAC II, or some improved successor to these powerful giants. The units in the model are given initial characteristics in accord with whatever initial distributions are considered to match those of the real socioeconomic system being dealt with. Use of the initial conditions in connection with the relations and tables specified by the various operating characteristics yields the probabilities associated with alternative outputs of each unit. Actual drawings take place, and the selected outputs are produced. These outputs become inputs in the appropriate units. The second round then proceeds in a manner similar to the first; but this time, since the inputs have modified the characteristics associated with units, different probabilities or probability distributions are determined by the various operating characteristics. Random drawings again take place and serve to determine the specific outputs, these in turn are translated into inputs, and everything is ready for the third period\u2019s round of activity. At every instant of time, the characteristics associated with each unit, such as age, marital status, income, asset structure, location, etc., are precisely specified. The operating characteristics associated with each unit, and the previous inputs into the unit, determine the probability of occurrence associated with each of the various actions or types of behavior that the unit may produce.

This means that it would be necessary to infer the properties of models with hundreds of millions of units from models having something like tens of thousands of units. It seems fairly certain that such extrapolation would definitely be feasible. In fact, it would seem to be very straightforward compared to the problem of making inferences from models with only a very small number of units. Furthermore, given the fantastic rate at which the power, capacity, and speed of calculating machinery is increasing, it does not seem unreasonable to believe that within five to ten years it will be possible to operate such a model with substantially more units. Whether any significant gain would be achieved in going from models of, say, ten thousand units to models with millions of units is not so evident. The gain would depend on the extent to which such models are elaborated and the extent to which predictions are desired for very small sectors of the socio-economic system. The minimum number of units that reasonably might be used is the number needed to approximate adequately the initial joint distribution of units by characteristics of the real socio-economic system being represented. As long as the proportion of units in the various cells was maintained, any larger number of units presumably could be used without altering the expected value of aggregates. The variances associated with estimators of aggregates would be expected to vary inversely with the total number of units.",

This approach would be a head-on one, in which, having completely specified the model and having specified the aggregates of interest, one then proceeds to derive the probability distributions of these aggregates by purely deductive means from the model. In principle this is possible, and, in fact, a set of calculations that would achieve this could certainly be specified. It may be that this approach could be, and will be, carried through by some-one; and if so, we should all be grateful, since the important thing is effective implementation of such models and not the particular manner in which they are solved. The major reason that this approach is not suggested here is that I believe that, while this approach seems an obvious one and might yield somewhat more precise knowledge of the solution, it would in fact involve many times the computational effort than the one suggested in this paper. In view of the fact that even the attack suggested will involve a very substantial computational effort, the volume of computation required to reach a satisfactory solution cannot as yet be ignored.",

But in a system such as we envisage, the number of possible ways of reaching a given value or range of values for a given aggregate would certainly be fantastically large, since the number of paths that might be followed by each individual is already almost beyond comprehension, if many variables and many time periods are involved. Since each possible variation of path of each and every unit will correspond to a different path by which the system generates aggregates, the problem of keeping track of all possible paths and their respective probabilities appears rather appalling. Nevertheless, it is probably true that, by appropriate mathematical techniques or by working with only the first few moments, ways can be found of drastically simplifying what at first appears to be an impossible computational problem. If this turns out to be the case, so much the better.",

These models could be used either for unconditional forecasting or for predictions of what would happen given specified external conditions and governmental actions. The most that would be involved here would be substitution of certain things as given instead of having them generated by some process. All predictions could be obtained in the form of expected values plus some measure of uncertainty. Or, if desired, they could be in the form of confidence interval estimates. This is possible, since each time the model is started off with specified initial conditions and let run, it will generate one estimate of each aggregate of interest. Estimates on successive runs will be independent since all random sampling will be independent as between runs. Thus, by running a given model, with given initial and external inputs, more than once, it is readily possible to estimate the expected value and the variance associated with estimates of each aggregate.
