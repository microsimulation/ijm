MELC models child development from birth through to age 13, encompassing changes in material and family circumstances, family functioning and early education. MELC focusses on three main outcomes: health service use, early literacy, and conduct problems. A synthetic base population (n = 10,000) derived from the 2006 New Zealand Census is used, and transitions through the life-course are determined from estimates derived by analysing three New Zealand child cohort studies: the Christchurch Health and Development Study, the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, and the Pacific Islands Families Study. The model has been validated against New Zealand norms for reading, general practitioner visits and hospital admissions. Three scenarios were demonstrated. First, we tested the impact of a number of putatively important factors on early literacy, and found small effects. Second, we found that halving the prevalence of single parenting reduced the prevalence of conduct problems. Third, we changed a number of material and family factors for M\u0101ori, Pacific and low-socio-economic groups to be equal to those for the general population, and found that this produced small improvements in reading, but large reductions in conduct problems for these groups. MELC has been deployed as a user friendly desktop application at a number of New Zealand government agencies, where it can be used to test policy-relevant scenarios.",

Policy analysts from New Zealand government ministries have been involved in the development of the model. In particular, the policy analysts wanted MELC to be able to be used to determine all the factors that are important for child outcomes, whether or not these factors could be targets for policy interventions. As such, all factors within the model are able to be changed; not just those considered to be obvious targets for policy intervention.

The distribution of some outcomes required modelling that was more involved. For example, for hours worked per week by the mother and father there was a large peak at zero indicating the mother or father was not in the workforce, and then a relative normal distribution (with a peak around 40 hours) for mothers and fathers in the workforce. This was modelled in a two-step process whereby the chance of being in the workforce was first modelled using logistic regression.

Thus, the only imputation that was needed for the CHDS data was to complete missing cases for some variables. This was achieved by first ordering variables from least missing to most missing. The variable with the least missing values was then regressed against all variables with no missing values (n = 11), and missing values were then stochastically \u2013 and singly \u2013 imputed based on the model estimates. Then, the variable with the next least missing values was regressed against all complete variables (now n = 12), and missing values were imputed in the same way. This process was continued until all variables were complete. Regression models were chosen based on the distribution of the outcome variable: ordinary least-squares regression was used for continuous outcomes; logistic regression used for binary outcomes; multinomial logistic regression used for categorical outcomes; and Poisson or negative binomial regression used for count outcomes.",

For example, if the number of children at age 3 was 2 and at age 7 was 4, then the number of children at age 5 was imputed by randomly choosing from the values {2,3,4}, with the probability of choosing each value determined by the proportion with values {2,3,4} among the CHDS sub-sample for whom the number of children at age 3 was 2 and at age 7 was 4.",

A random draw is then taken from the appropriate distribution (normal, Poisson, negative binomial, binomial) using the expected score/probability as the mean of the distribution and the appropriate model-estimated parameter as the variance (the residual standard error for the normal distribution, the mean for the Poisson distribution, and the dispersion parameter for the negative binomial distribution; no variance measure is required for the binomial distribution as only 0s and 1s are generated). This random draw constitutes the stochastic value assigned to each individual for each outcome, and will vary from simulation run to simulation run as different random draws are taken.

Prevalences of outcomes for the New Zealand population were derived from the following sources. For general practitioner visits and outpatients attendances we used the New Zealand Health Survey (NZHS) 2011\u201312 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ministry of Health, 2012</a>), for hospitalisations we used the National Minimum Dataset (NMDS) data for 2006 (<a href=\"#bib41\">National Health Board, 2013</a>) as the numerator and the 2006 New Zealand Census population (<a href=\"#bib53\">Statistics New Zealand, 2012</a>) as the denominator, and for reading we used age norms published in the Burt Word Reading Test Teachers Manual (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gilmore <i>et al</i>., 1976</a>).

Differences in methodology are likely to explain the differences for age 1: the MELC simulation models the number of GP visits in the first year of life whereas the NZHS assesses GP visits in the previous 12 months for a sample of children ages 0\u201311 months old, so the NZHS does not capture a full year of visits for many of these children. Notably the MELC simulated estimates for year 1 are nearly twice those of the NZHS, consistent with GP visits for NZHS children being substantially undercounted in the second half of the year. The MELC model was amended to bring the GP visits into line for ages 3\u20135 by adjusting the intercept; this maintains the rank order of all children and also leaves the coefficients of all modifiable factors unchanged, thus performing a similar job as other alignment methods, e.g., sorting methods (<a href=\"#bib27\">Li &amp; O\u2019Donahue, 2014</a>).",

We achieved this by changing the distributions of various factors (e.g., changing a proportion of children in welfare-dependent homes; changing the birth weight distribution for children) to mimic the impact of a particular policy intervention under consideration. We chose to change distributions rather than reweight the dataset so that: (i) only downstream variables are affected (weighting affects all variables), thus allowing users to assess the likely effect on any outcome or indeed any other variable in the simulation; (ii) any combination of variables for any subgroup of the population could be changed for a scenario (weighting becomes more complicated the more variables that are changed); and (iii) change is simulated for those most likely to change, via propensity score models described below (weighting implicitly equally weights all those in the target group).",

We note that single parenting is a well-established predictor of child conduct problems (<a href=\"#bib40\">Murray &amp; Farrington, 2010</a>), though its association may be complicated (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jaffee <i>et al</i>., 2003</a>).

Simulated GP visit numbers were close to those reported in a national survey for ages 2 and 6\u201310, but underestimated the number of visits for 3\u20135 year olds and methodological reasons prevented accurate comparisons for the first year of life. The simulation model was calibrated to the national survey estimates to account for the underestimate in years 3\u20135. However, simulation results for hospital outpatient attendances showed quite different trends to those reported in a national survey. These likely reflect differences between the early life-course trajectory of hospital outpatient attendances reported by the child cohort studies (two of which began in the 1970s) and the early life-course trajectory of hospital outpatient attendances that children in New Zealand experience in the 2000s. While post-modelling calibration was able to bring simulated results in line with national estimates, question marks should remain over modelling this outcome.",

Second, MELC covers a limited lifespan (from birth to age 13) for a limited range of factors. Work is underway to extend the model to early adulthood to encompass transitions out of school into employment or further training, and we also plan to increase the range of factors to broaden the policy relevance of the model.",

The value of micro-simulation in MELC \u2013 as opposed to separate statistical modelling of each outcome \u2013 is that it incorporates the statistical modelling into one system, which allows policy makers the flexibility to test the impact of (potentially) many X on (potentially) many Y, and also the effect for subgroups of interest, while accounting for the stochastic nature of life transitions (e.g., those with a high probability of X will not necessarily exhibit X).

First, the <i>improving early literacy</i> scenario showed reliable but small improvements to literacy as a result of changing four factors: maternal age, maternal education, birth weight, and living in an owned home. This suggests that even sizeable changes in a number of factors sometimes do not have the large impact desired, perhaps because effect sizes are often small. Also of note here is that the factors found most likely to improve literacy are not typically considered as targets for policy intervention, especially for an education outcome. Thus, while one can imagine policy interventions that could affect all four, it is hard to compare the findings of the scenarios presented to findings in the intervention literature. However, all four factors have been shown to be associated with reading improvements (maternal age: <a href=\"#bib49\">Shaw <i>et al</i>., 2006</a>; maternal education: <a href=\"#bib31\">Magnuson, 2007</a>; birth weight: <a href=\"#bib7\">Chatterji <i>et al</i>., 2014</a>; living in an owned home: <a href=\"#bib23\">Haurin <i>et al</i>., 2002</a>).",

The impact of single parenting on conduct problems has been well-established in the literature (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hill, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Murray &amp; Farrington 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Murray <i>et al</i>. 2013</a>), with estimates suggesting that experiencing a change from a two-parent to a single parent household is associated with a 0.2SD increase in conduct scores (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ryan <i>et al</i>., 2014</a>).",

Altering proportions and means of a number of structural, perinatal and parenting factors relative to the general population for M\u0101ori, Pacific or low-socio-economic status resulted in moderate reductions in conduct problems for each of these groups, but only modest improvements to reading, and no change in hospital admissions. The findings for reading and conduct problems mirrored those for the general population in the other two scenarios tested: very small effects on reading and larger effects on conduct problems. The finding for hospital admissions perhaps indicate that the factors that influence \u2018generic\u2019 health service use outcomes such as hospital admissions are not easily captured because the risks factors may either be condition-specific (e.g., asthma, <a href=\"#bib10\">Davidson <i>et al</i>., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Algert <i>et al</i>., 2011</a>), or may be clinical factors (e.g., <a href=\"#bib2\">Algert <i>et al</i>., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gill <i>et al</i>., 2015</a>) rather than the socio-economic or behavioural factors that are the focus of the MELC model.
