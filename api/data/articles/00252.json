This paper reports on the issues relating to incorporating behavioural response into the model. It explores the problems and prospects of modelling changes in behaviour within the static microsimulation approach, using cross-sectional data. In the case of labour supply it concludes that not only are there problems related to the timing of responses using the static approach, but also a lack of comparable studies (or data) across all 15 countries. A dynamic approach using panel data has more potential and should be explored for a small group of countries. In the case of consumer demand, behavioural adjustment can be assumed to be quick and there is some potential for including demand responses in EUROMOD.",

The EUROMOD project was started to build a tax-benefit model for all countries in the European Union. This model will, to the extent possible, build on common concepts to make feasible EU-wide studies of tax and benefit changes.

These models are computer programs of all the details of the tax and benefit systems applied to a random sample of individuals. For each individual one knows all incomes and all other circumstances of importance for the eligibility of various transfers and for the computation of taxes and benefits, and it is thus possible to compute incomes after tax and benefits for each individual, taking into account all interactions between the tax system and the transfer and benefit systems. Such models are static in the sense that they operate on a given population of individuals. The population does not change as a result of the simulation. They only give the first order effects of tax and benefit changes, because gross incomes and other variables are assumed not to change when taxes and benefits change. The behavioral adjustments which follow from new incentives are thus not included in these static microsimulation models.",

This paper discusses the inclusion of behavioural response in EUROMOD, if it is conceptually meaningful and if it is feasible from a more practical point of view. The whole discussion is limited to behavioural responses of single individuals. There is no discussion of macroeconomic feedback mechanisms. A model which jointly simulates the macro economy and the micro-economic distributions is not yet practical. The conceptual problems are approached first in Section 3. Then follows in Section 4 a discussion of what kind of behaviour one would like to model with an emphasis on two examples. Estimation, validation and weighting problems are briefly addressed in Sections 5 and 6, while Section 7 concludes.",

Another conclusion is that we have so far found no theoretical reasons why a static model could not include behavioural adjustments. The predictions from such a model have, however, the same limitations as those from a conventional static simulation model. There is no time dimension, and no statement can be made as to when, if at all, policy changes will have full effect. However, this does not preclude the comparisons between policy regimes which can be made within a static model being of interest. It all hinges on the behavioural model having a natural equilibrium or steady state interpretation.

If it is not possible to solve the model analytically for the target variables as a reduced form function of the policy variables, which is usually not the case, then one would have to iterate back and forth between the submodels. For instance, in the case of a Hausman labour supply model and housing benefits, one might start by computing the housing benefits for some set of taxable incomes, then plug in the resulting benefits into the budget set and compute hours of work and labour income, then turn to the benefits again, and so on until some kind of convergence criterion is satisfied.

The second cited study, for example, finds that in Australia the replacement of an existing wholesale sales tax with a 5.2% general consumption tax causes a revenue change which differs only by about 0.2 per cent from the change computed in the absence of behavioural effects. If this is true and not too specific to the single case, not evaluating the behavioural response might not give any major error. The same study, however, also concludes that it is important to allow for the interaction between the sales tax and other taxes and that allowing for behavioural responses has effects on the distributive impacts of indirect taxes.",

This situation is usually characterized by unstable cross\u00ad sections, and large policy changes will then tend to change the cross-sectional relations. Cross-sectionally estimated models then have little meaning.

However, if models for behavioural adjustments are added there is a validation problem. How would one go about validating a static behavioural model? Is it at all possible? The problem with the comparative statics of a static microsimulation model is that it does not give predictions for any specific time point or time interval, and thus, it is hard to know to what the predictions should be compared. Suppose, for instance, that a labour force participation equation is estimated from a cross\u00ad section at the end of a long period of unchanged tax and benefit systems and a stable labour market. Then a major tax reform takes place.

In static microsimulation changes in the composition of the population is usually achieved by changing the weights. (There is of course an issue of the applicability of the estimated behavioural relations to the new population implicitly defined by the new weights.) In principle one could also ask a third question: what is the difference, say in income inequality, between policy 1 applied to population 1 and policy 2 applied to population 2? But it is not obvious that this is a meaningful question. Note that a static model does not give a prediction on the change in inequality from one year to another, not even if one changes the weights to account for changes in the population of this country.",

In a European perspective, these difficulties are compounded by lack of comparable studies of behaviour across countries. Either new studies must be carried out, constrained in the short term to using available data, or results for one country must be assumed to apply in another. It is most unlikely that behaviour is consistent across Europe, given the wide variation in cultural, historical and institutional factors. While in principle it is possible to estimate new models which take these factors into account, this is itself another major project. Further problems occur in the European context if cross-border issues arise.
