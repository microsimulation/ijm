We project demographic changes by means of two multi-state population projections (LIPRO-projections), on the basis of which we statically reweigh the <i>EU-SILC</i> 2008 dataset. In addition, we assume a modest real <i>exogenous</i> \u2013meaning not induced by the demographic projections\u2013 growth rate of 1%. Population-wise, we find a pronounced ageing, a growth of single-headed households, mostly to the detriment of couples with children, and a closing generational gap in education. While income inequality exhibits a non-monotonous pattern over time (reaching a maximum around 2020), poverty steadily declines after 2011. We find a large increase in expenditures on pensions, which is, however, covered by the modest public income growth we assume, while keeping the tax system constant <i>in real terms</i>.",

From the 1960s onward, driven by new gender and generational relations, divorce rates started to rise, marriage became less popular and, with the exception of the baby-boom years, fertility continued to show an overall decreasing trend (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lesthaeghe &amp; Neels, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Van Bavel &amp; Bastiaenssen, 2006</a>). The onset of this so-called second demographic transition occurred about 20 years later in Belgium, particularly in Flanders, compared to neighbouring countries, while resulting trends were, until recently, less pronounced (<a href=\"#bib12\">Deboosere <i>et al</i>., 2009</a>). After 1980, however, Flanders started to catch-up with international trends and different family formation processes proliferated. As a result, households have become smaller in general (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lodewijcks &amp; Deboosere, 2011</a>) and, especially among the young, unmarried couples and single-headed households have proliferated (<a href=\"#bib12\">Deboosere <i>et al</i>., 2009</a>).",

Under the impulse of labour market demands and political and societal investments in the educational system, ever more children enter schooling and remain in training for a longer period of time (<a href=\"#bib53\">Vanderstraeten, 1999</a>). Parallel, from the 1960s onward, we observe a democratization and growing gender equity in education, although social inequality remains a critical aspect of Flanders\u2019 educational system at all levels (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pelleriaux, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Verbergt, Cantillon, &amp; Van den Bosch, 2009</a>), the breach between classes has decreased (<a href=\"#bib24\">Groenez, 2010</a>).

This understanding is far from easy, since different components of demographic change are intertwined and may have counteracting effects. In this respect the ageing, in particular the growing share of the population above 65, is presumed to increase inequality, since elderly population\u2019s income is lower and their poverty ratio higher than that of the working-age population. In addition, in Flanders, this generational gap seems to have increased over time (<a href=\"#bib51\">Van den Bosch <i>et al</i>., 2009</a>). However, ageing also implies an increase in life expectancy, and couple\u2019s survival has a positive effect on household income: women depend less on a widows\u2019 pension and also, with the increase in education and female labour force participation, households will often have two pensions or combine a pension with (the younger womans\u2019) income from wages. Consequently, the net effect of ageing on the income distribution remains ambiguous. <a href=\"#bib34\">Mookherjee and Shorrocks (1982)</a> found that, in the UK, the shift in age-income relationship had an impact on inequality, but the population\u2019s compositional change did not. More recently, the latter was confirmed for other European countries by the <i>Social Situation Monitor</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">European Commission: DG Employment, Social Affairs &amp; Inclusion, 2017</a>).",

Being less able to pool income resources (combined with the gender pay gap), single-headed households and especially single parents have a lower income compared to the household income of the rest of the population. In addition, no improvement in the situation of single parents is observed over time (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tai &amp; Treas, 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2009</a>). This general phenomenon is also observed in Flanders (<a href=\"#bib47\">Studiedienst Vlaamse Regering, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Van den Bosch <i>et al</i>., 2009</a>). A rise in the prevalence of female single-headed households is therefore often found to trigger an increase in inequality and poverty (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bradley, Huber, Moller, Nielson, &amp; Stephens, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kollmeyer, 2013</a>). With the increase in education and subsequent increased female labour force participation, however, this tendency might reverse. In addition, <a href=\"#bib16\">Esping-Andersen (2007)</a> indicates that the negative influence of single motherhood is mainly restricted to the United States as the strong European welfare state mitigates its impact.",

However, the larger the group of the educated and the lower educational disparity, the smaller the role this factor will play in the determination of income inequality. In the long run, we might well expect the rise in educational attainment to temper inequality. In this respect, <a href=\"#bib7\">Breen and Salazar (2010)</a> found that changes in women\u2019s education and their behavioural consequences account for little if any of the growth in earnings inequality between households, while <a href=\"#bib30\">Kollmeyer (2013)</a> found that it decreases inequality.",

From a policy point of view, this is important; for social policy to go beyond ad hoc answers to structural changes, it needs to be informed on how future population (and economic) characteristics affect inequality. In addition, this prospective view can re-mediate some of the difficulties related to contextual factors faced by retrospective research (<a href=\"#bib16\">Esping-Andersen, 2007</a>). Building on hypothetical scenarios about economic growth and population forecasts, we isolate our analysis from temporal and contextual influences and gain at least partial control over interactions with non-observed variables. Note that we limit our attention to the coming 13 year period, which is the time frame in which the baby-boom generation will reach retirement age.

Comparison of the counterfactual Gini-index with the actual one at <i>t</i><sub>0</sub> reveals the effect of changing population structure, while the difference between counterfactual and the distribution at <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> is a residual effect.

Secondly, LIPRO is a fully dynamic model where vital events and migration are differentiated by, and interact with household formation or educational processes. If, for example, fertility is lower among higher educated women, a rise in the population\u2019s educational levels will temper total fertility rates, even though for all educational levels alike we considered a relative fertility increase comparable to the one predicted by <a href=\"#bib46\">Studiedienst Vlaamse Regering (2011)</a>. In other words, important compositional population changes mitigate the evolution of fertility, mortality and migration, and consequently impose constraints on future population trends. Thirdly, modification in one household position also imposes constraints on the adjustments in other household positions. For example, if for the purpose of population projections we accept the number of same-sex couple formation to be negligible, the number of men that transit into the state of \u201cmarried couple without children\u201d should be equal to the number of women entering this state (and vice versa). In other words, LIPRO calibrates the theoretically linked transitions. The constraints included in the household projection are explained by <a href=\"#bib41\">Schockaert and Surkyn (2013)</a>. For the educational projection, no constraints were used. The above properties of LIPRO projections enhance the reliability of the results by ensuring coherence in population trends.",

Reweighing by a simple reweighing of cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kalton &amp; Flores-Cervantes, 2003</a>), however, is ruled out for two reasons. First, due to insufficient observations we use two sets of demographic projections. Since these are made independently from each other, they possibly result in conflicting reweighing factors. Although a simple solution seems to be available by calibrating the conflicting individual weights, a second more fundamental problem remains. In the described demographic projections, the unit of observation is the individual, while for our distributional analysis, we prefer the household as unit of observation, since the household composition is the cornerstone for equivalising income. In order to marry the individual-based demographic projections with the household-based inequality and poverty analysis, we calibrate the base year sample using household weights to the individual-based totals implied by the demographic projections (<a href=\"#bib14\">Deville &amp; Sarndal, 1992</a>). Such a calibration procedure finds new weights as close as possible to the old ones, such that the individual-based demographically projected totals are respected.<sup><a href=\"#fn8\">8</a></sup> A detailed description can be found in <a href=\"#bib11\">De Blander, Schockaert, Decoster, and Deboosere (2013)</a>.",

However, the returns to education can fluctuate for each education level depending on the relative demand and supply in each labour market segment. Jobs for which there are shortages of qualified candidates, will typically be more highly remunerated. On the other hand, if the proportion of highly educated increases faster than the labour demand for this type of workers, we might witness a decrease of the return to education over time for the highest educated. Such a detailed level of labour market scenarios is, however, beyond the scope of this paper.",

The <i>x</i>-axes represent five-year age groups and the <i>y</i>-axes, the proportion of individuals from each age group in single-headed households (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) and in couples with and without children (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>, respectively). Each curve, from light to dark grey, represents a consecutive projection year. A first important evolution is the decrease of the share of individuals that live in couples with children. This is related to the decrease and postponement of couple formation and to fertility decline. The latter development explains the larger decrease after the age of 40, as low fertility leads to a shorter total time span that children are present at their parent\u2019s household. Higher divorce rates add to this evolution and also explain the decreasing prevalence of couples without children at more advanced adult age. However, among the elderly population, above the age of 75 for women and 85 for men, the prevalence of individuals living in a couple increases in time. This is easily understood as the result of growing partner\u2019s survival rates since we projected women\u2019s and especially men\u2019s life expectancy to grow. The decrease in the share of couples in the population over time results in the rise of single-headed households, most eminent between the age of 40 and 70.",

The Figure shows that parallel to ageing and changes in household position, for all age groups and each gender, we foresee a considerable advancement in educational attainment. That is, for each age group the share of the population with higher secondary and higher education becomes larger over time. This process is almost entirely due to the ageing of the population as from each projection year to the next, the educational profile of the younger generations is progressively spread to all ages. Therefore, in the first part of the projection period, especially the 40 \u2212 64-age group\u2019s educational attainment increases; in the second half of the projection period, the 65+ educational attainment rises most while below 60, practically no change is observed any more. Within the population under the age of 35, practically no change is observed since we assumed only minor adaptations in educational behaviour (see <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>).

Note that both effects are entirely due to population change, since we assume \u201cno <i>efficiency growth</i>\u201d. Clearly, changes in the income <i>shares</i> are largely driven by <i>observed</i> changes in the population composition; a change in the prevalence of a population category provokes an income share change in the same direction. This way we can directly link the results with the population change described in <a href=\"#s3\">Section 3</a>. Changes in the <i>within-group inequality</i> are related to the subgroup composition with respect to the demographic variables <i>omitted</i> in the decomposition exercise (sex and household composition in the first and sex and education in the second exercise), but that induce changes in the subgroup\u2019s labour force participation rate and/or endogenous income growth.",

The latter process is related to the general increase in educational attainment depicted in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. The reduction of between-group inequality can easily be understood by the attenuation of generational differences in education. However, <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a> also shows that the increase of the income share of individuals over 55 with secondary or higher education, increases inequality. In other words, ageing and the subsequent growth of the elderly population increases inequality, despite their higher educational attainment.

The decrease of the adult population younger than 55 living in couples with children has a negative impact on inequality. Note that the within-group inequality among many couples of the same age group increases, as well as the between-group inequality between 2011 and 2021. This can be explained by the fact that educational growth, especially at the beginning of the projection period, increasingly differentiates among individuals in similar household positions. This process is more evident in couples than single-headed households due to the larger effect of education on the income growth of double-income households.<sup><a href=\"#fn14\">14</a></sup>",

We reweighed the <i>EU-SILC</i> 2008 survey data to construct the necessary income data for each five year period between 2011 and 2031. Assumptions about population change were conservative: we presumed only changes in mortality, fertility and migration following the current official Flemish hypotheses, whereas household formation processes and educational behaviour were kept (nearly) constant to the projection base-year information of 2006. In addition, we assumed a modest economic <i>efficiency</i> growth of 1% annually.",

Inequality, measured by the Gini and Theil indices, is lower in 2031 than in 2011, but it exhibits a non-monotonous pattern over time, reaching a maximum around 2020. This pattern is mainly driven by population change, while economic growth has a small but increasing impact over time. Poverty steadily declines from 2011 onward. This is due to a growth effect, reinforced by population change.",

However, this spectacular increase in pension volume is completely paid by the modest growth we assume and by keeping the tax system constant <i>in real terms</i>.

The impact on inequality of changes in population subgroups remain similar over time, but depending on the observation period the effect of one predominates over the other. In addition, the results show the counteracting effects of the population ageing process. With ageing, the elderly population increases but educational levels also rise and generational differences attenuate. Over the total observation period between 2011 and 2031 the latter two processes play the larger role: the overall decrease in inequality is mainly due to a declining between-group income variation reinforced by a decline of the population with no or only primary education. Also the drop in prevalence of couples with children reduces inequality. During the period between 2011 and 2021, in contrast, the impact of the growing elderly population, especially single-headed households, outgrows that of educational attainment growth and between-group inequality reduction, producing a temporary increase in inequality. The reduction in poverty between 2011 and 2031 can to a large extent be attributed to the decrease of the population share with only or less than primary education. Among the elderly population this effect is enhanced by a a prominent reduction in within-poverty <i>levels</i>. Educational increase counterbalances the effect of the rise of single-headed households to the detriment of couples, that would have increased overall poverty if their poverty levels would not have declined due to educational improvement.",

In the case of nuclear families, the application of the above rules is not problematic. In the case of extended families, additional restrictions become necessary. When the extended family involves grandparents, parents and children, the grandparents are assigned the MAR+ or UNM+ category. This implies that the second generation is classified as CMAR or CUNM and the grandchildren will be OTHR/NFR. The same rule is applied if there is only one grandparent present; the first generation is H1[a80]A, the second C1[a80]A and the grandchildren OTHR/NFR. This choice has implications for the population structure. Most grandparents are married couples, while this is less the case for the second generation among which consensual unions are more accepted.

Several processes are at the basis of these divergences. The underestimation of singles, and single parents and their children in the <i>EUSILC</i> most probably reveals a sampling error not entirely corrected by the weights; drop-out and non-response is higher among individuals living alone (or alone with children) than among larger households. The larger proportion of UNM0 and UNM+ in <i>EU-SILC</i> than in the Projection Results is more puzzling. In the Census and Register data used for the projections, the LIPRO-household position is defined using the relationship of each member with the household head. While in the <i>EU-SILC</i> data, the unmarried couple is always defined as UNM0 or UNM+, this is not the case in the Projection Results, where another member can take the role of the household head. More important yet is the absence of a clear manner to identify consensual unions in Census and Register data; when the household head is not married, no relationship is defined. To identify the UNM0 and UNM+ individuals, <a href=\"#bib12\">Deboosere <i>et al</i>. (2009)</a> therefore proposed that individuals of the opposite sex and without family relation to the household head are a potential partner. However, this person should have an age difference of at least 15 years to all other non-family related members. This last restriction may lead to an underestimation of consensual unions.",
