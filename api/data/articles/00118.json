This includes measuring income inequality at the regional level. In this article, we have used spatial microsimulation techniques to calculate small area inequality in Australia using disposable income data which are not available at a small area level, drawing together data from the Australian Census and survey data. Using disposable income data increases the strength of the results, as a more accurate measure of income distribution is able to be obtained. We estimate inequality at a small area level for the two most populous states in Australia \u2013 New South Wales and Victoria using conventional Gini coefficient methodology. We also examine the differences in inequality between the densely populated capital cities of each state and the balance of these states or rural areas. The results show that there are marked variations in inequality with distinct pockets of small areas with high income inequality in both states and their capital cities. The small area inequality estimation enables the policy maker to pinpoint pockets of inequality. This will be useful to identify regions that need better targeting/interventions.",

Inequality can have social and political implications as <a href=\"#bib49\">Wilkinson (2006)</a> argues this may create social and political conflict, violence and other issues. Knowing inequality is important because it helps policy makers to understand better the causes of inequality and may help target policy programs better. In comparison to other OECD countries, the recent data in late 2000s, shows that Australia was the 9th most unequal of the 34 OECD members with a Gini coefficient of 0.34 (<a href=\"#bib34\">OECD 2011</a>). This was substantially higher than Slovenia, which had the lowest inequality of 0.24, higher than the OECD average of 0.31, but much lower than Chile, which had the highest inequality of 0.49 (<a href=\"#bib34\">OECD 2011</a>)<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup>. Further, inequality in Australia has been increasing in the last decade, with the data showing the Gini coefficient was lower at 0.305 in early 2000s. While this provides us with a picture of where Australia falls internationally in terms of income inequality, much more can be said about the nature of inequality in Australia, and in this paper we focus on a sub-national analysis of Australia\u2019s income inequality.",

First, this research explores inequality for small areas using equivalised household disposable income data calculated using spatial microsimulation techniques, whilst for example, <a href=\"#bib7\">Athanasopoulos and Vahid (2003)</a> use gross income. As disposable income data is not available at a small area level, a spatial microsimulation model is used to calculate inequality. Using equivalised household disposable income increases the strength of the results, as a more accurate measure of living standards is able to be obtained as it measures resources available to households after paying income tax (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lyold <i>et al</i>. 2000</a>) and provides a truer measure of inequality: as argued in <a href=\"#bib23\">Harding (1997)</a> there is some evidence that the income tax system has become more progressive and provides an offsetting force to growing inequality of gross income. Second, the unit of analysis used in this paper is the Statistical Local Area (SLA), which is a smaller geographical unit than any that has been used in previous Australian studies. Using a smaller spatial unit has several advantages, including the ability to pinpoint pockets of inequality, to link these with other small area characteristics, and to assist with effective policy and program targeting. An additional advantage of the methodology used in our analysis is that it gives a more precise measure of inequality than traditional measures, due to the ability of spatial microsimulation to create the distribution of disposable household income at the small area level.",

These states are also the two most populous states in Australia, containing around 58 percent of Australia\u2019s total population in 2006. We calculate Gini coefficients for each SLA in New South Wales and Victoria. There are two main objectives of this research. Firstly, to provide valuable information about regional inequality at a small area level at a more disaggregated geographical level than what has been done previously. Secondly, to explore another use of spatial microsimulation and demonstrate its superiority in this area so that similar methodology can be applied to estimate small area inequality in other countries.",

The sample used by the ABS for the SIH covers occupied private dwellings only. In contrast to the Census, the SIH has rich, detailed information about a range of socioeconomic variables, including disposable income. This detailed information on the SIH allows Gini coefficients to be generated using equivalised disposable income, in comparison to Census data which only provides income in ranges and available as <i>gross income</i> only.<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> However, the SIH does not provide a detailed geographical disaggregation. Therefore, the SIH is suitable for analysing inequality at a larger geographical area such as national or state level, but not for small areas; while the Census is suitable for analysing many household characteristics at a small area level, but does not provide enough income data to create acceptable measures of inequality. Our spatial microsimulation techniques bring these two data sources together, using the Census to provide reliable small area benchmarks, creating household weights for each SLA, which are used to reweight the unit record file from SIH data. The Gini coefficients are calculated at the person level using household income, as we assume income sharing within households and, prior to conducting the analysis, negative household incomes are recoded to zero to follow the standard approach of the ABS (Li 2005).

Income in Census data is only available as gross household income. In common with other research, disposable household incomes are equivalised, so that rankings of income will then take into account the differences that household size and composition make to standards of living. Equivalence scales give \u2018points\u2019 to each adult and child in the household, and then the household\u2019s disposable income is divided by the sum of these points so that incomes can be compared across different types of households. Here we use the modified OECD equivalence scale, which assigns the following values: 1.0 point for the first adult; 0.5 for each of the remaining adults and 0.3 for each dependent child in the household. It should be noted that for the purposes of calculating equivalised income, dependent children are defined as only those children aged less than 15 years, in common with current Australian practice.",

Given that this particular study investigates inequality in terms of equivalised household disposable income, the spatial microsimulation estimates cannot solely depend on gross equivalised weekly household income data that are available in the Census data. The simulation also needs to include other variables that may affect tax paid and benefits received and consequently disposable income estimates. This means other household characteristics need to be included in addition to the income variable.

With the latest criteria, if the absolute total error from all the benchmarks is greater than the population in that SLA, then the accuracy criteria has failed, and the SLA is dropped from any further analysis. Generally, the convergence criteria and the accuracy criteria provide the same results when an area has obviously not converged; but for marginal areas, the area may reach the maximum number of iterations but still provide a reasonable total absolute error.

While these findings may be useful for the purpose of policy interventions, the results and their implications should be interpreted cautiously, due to the complexities inherent in understanding the phenomenon of high inequality in small areas. For example, small areas with low inequality may not necessarily reflect a more cohesive society overall or a lack of social and economic problems. A number of studies, especially those from United States have indicated that low inequality in small areas may also point towards segregation issues. <a href=\"#bib46\">Watson (2009)</a> has argued that inequality may affect income sorting that leads to income segregation at the neighbourhood level. <a href=\"#bib37\">Reardon and Bischoff (2011)</a> echo these results stating that lower income households tend to live in neighbourhoods with lower incomes while higher income households tend to live within neighbourhoods with higher incomes. Income segregation may have a negative impact on social, political and health related outcomes. Racial tensions and increasing crime rates are examples of these unwanted outcomes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bayer <i>et al</i>. 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sethi and Somathan, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Watson 2009</a>). Thus, policy makers need to consider the balance between the potential benefits of reducing within-area inequality and the potential adverse impact of segregation, particularly where this has implications for high levels of neighbourhood or interregional inequality. However, it is not clear to what extent international findings are relevant in an Australian context, and research has found more inequality between neighbourhoods in the United States than in Australia (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hunter 2003</a>).",

Firstly, the paper has demonstrated the use of a spatial microsimulation technique to estimate inequality at small area level that can be applied in other countries. Secondly, the findings of this research show that inequality does differ considerably when drilling down to smaller spatial areas. For example, we have found that most of small areas with the highest income inequality are clustered in the capital cities but not necessarily in the rural areas.",

By knowing which small areas are more unequal in regards to income, together with the characteristics of these areas, policy makers and service providers are able to better understand the intricacies of inequality and identify possible drivers, which can aid in more efficient targeting of programs and policy. Nevertheless, it is important to note that examining small area inequality does not in and of itself lead to definitive conclusions about the overall wellbeing of an area. In particular, low inequality does not necessarily equate to better community outcomes, nor does high inequality necessarily relate to poorer outcomes. Low inequality within an area may be a symptom of a highly segregated population, which in turn can be associated with interregional inequality and social unrest.",
