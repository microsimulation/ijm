Using data integrating Italy\u2019s Institute for Statistics enterprise survey data and company accounts, we explore the effects of the Dual Income Tax on enterprise performance in 1998\u20132001. Firms benefiting from this allowance are simulated through the DIECOFIS corporate tax microsimulation model. The method to estimate enterprise performance is based on a structural equation model which allows us to compute a composite indicator given specific factors observed from enterprise activity. We find a positive impact of the Dual Income Tax on enterprise performance in that companies benefiting from this allowance outperformed non-eligible ones.",

Generally speaking, a tax on firms is efficient when it leaves the firm behaviour unchanged after taxation, that is when decisions undertaken by the firm are unaffected by the presence of the tax. The efficiency features of a corporate tax system can be studied regarding the investment decisions of the firm as well as its financing policy. The latter aspect has received great attention both in the theoretical and empirical literature.",

This result changes when taxes are introduced. As the firm has three main financing sources, i.e. debt, retained earnings, and new shares issues, it can be demonstrated that the corporate tax system is neutral over the company financing decisions if the flow of before-tax profits remains unchanged after taxes for marginal investors, whether the return for investors takes the form of interest, dividends or capital gains. The corporate tax changes this picture as interest payments are usually deductible from the tax base while dividends are not; in this sense a corporate tax is not neutral over the company funding sources in that it favours debt over equity financing. The magnitude of these distortions then depends on the features of the corporate tax and personal tax regimes.",

In 1991, the <a href=\"#bib6\">Institute for Fiscal Studies (1991)</a> suggested introducing an allowance for corporate equity (ACE). The basic idea was to provide a deduction of a notional return on company equity from taxable profits so as to address the difference in the tax treatment of debt and equity. In recent years such systems have been in operation in some EU countries (for instance, besides Italy, Croatia, Austria and Belgium), though with differences in their practical application (<a href=\"#bib9\">Klemm, 2007</a>). However, in recent years most of these countries have scrapped these systems, offering different motivations.",

The first obvious feature is that it meets neutrality between debt and equity financing if tax parameters are chosen correctly. The second feature is that as the tax is not levied on the marginal investment, this system is neutral to firm investment decisions. Another property is that the system offsets the distortion originated by the difference between depreciation for tax purposes and economic depreciation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Boadway and Bruce, 1984</a>), as the advantage generated by tax depreciation is fully compensated by the reduction of (future) allowances. In this sense an ACE is again neutral over company investment decisions.",

This was part of a comprehensive reform that had the primary aim of a selective reduction in the burden of taxation so as to reduce the tax distortion between equity and debt financing. Under the DIT scheme a lower statutory rate is applied to the portion of profits representing the opportunity cost of new equity financing compared with other forms of capital investment. This system structurally reduced the corporate tax burden depending on the amount of the capital increase (new capital subscription and retained earnings) carried out by the company. It remained in place until 2004 when it was definitively abolished, although in July 2001, when a new government took office, some modifications to the original regime were adopted in order to rein in its effects. Several studies provide an assessment of the ACE systems, both for Italy and other countries (again see <a href=\"#bib9\">Klemm, 2007</a>, for a review). In Italy these studies concentrate on the impact of the DIT system on the company tax rate and the neutrality features of this regime with respect to the pre-existing one as well as the subsequent system.",

We expect three factors to work in this direction. First, the reduction in the cost of equity-funded investment capital has an impact on firms (usually small) with constraints on debt financing or in general on firms for which access to the credit market is more difficult. Secondly, as over-reliance on debt financing can be viewed as a potential threat to the financial stability of the corporate sector, the increase in firms\u2019 capitalization improves the competitive position of companies benefiting from the allowance. Lastly, the reduction in the effective tax rate obviously increases firm profitability.",

Specifically, when computing ordinary income, capital increases were to be multiplied (up to the enterprise net wealth threshold) by a conventional parameter set first at 1.2 in 2000 and then at 1.4 in 2001. Obviously, the idea the policy maker had in mind was to make the system a regime in which normal profits would be computed on the enterprise\u2019s entire capital stock rather than on capital increases. In addition, in the years 1999\u20132001 a temporary incentive scheme for investments financed out of the company\u2019s own capital was introduced for both corporations and unincorporated firms.

The measures in question froze the capital increases to be taken into account when computing ordinary income at those carried out until July 2001, lowered the imputed nominal rate and abolished the \u201cmultiplier\".

On the opposite, ex-ante marginal tax rates follow a forward-looking approach focussing on enterprise marginal decisions and are based on computations of the impact of taxes on the cost of capital. Specifically, ex-ante tax rates measure the theoretical tax burden on a hypothetical marginal investment (giving no extra-profits) that produces cash-flow chargeable to tax and, therefore, are calculated to analyse how the tax system affects a marginal investment undertaken by the company, using alternative financial sources. The methodology to derive ex-ante marginal indicators can be also extended to infra-marginal investments, that is investments with different rates of profitability. In the latter case the literature refers to ex-ante average tax rates.",

Such rates are particularly appropriate if the objective of the analysis is studying the effects of the tax system on enterprise cash flows and to focus on distributional burdens (for instance at sectoral level or on firms of different size).",

In order to compute a composite indicator we estimated a SEM where the performance factors and performance itself played the role of latent variables while the observed indicators were manifest variables. The model was estimated using the PLSPM approach to SEM (<a href=\"#bib15\">Wold, 1982</a>).

However, this result is most likely due to the negative economic cycle that evidently affected at a greater extend companies that benefited from the DIT compared to the group of firms not eligible to this regime.

However, we again emphasize the efficiency features of the DIT regime compared to a standard one and its selective nature: a DIT system incorporates an incentive to increase capitalization in order to qualify for the reduced rate of taxation and this appears crucial for the Italy\u2019s corporate sector where the debt-equity ratio is very high also by international standards (<a href=\"#bib5\">De Bondt, 1998</a>).",
