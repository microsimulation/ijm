This special issue focuses mainly on methodological issues in microsimulation. We have selected six papers that give a thorough overview of existing methods pertaining to an issue, or that introduce an original methodology to tackle a problem; or \u2013 preferably- that handle both. Seeing that the two of us have different backgrounds, we have looked for methodological issues that either cover common ground, or else might be interesting and relevant to researchers in fields other than those of the authors.",

Each manuscript was reviewed by the two guest editors and in most cases one external reviewer. The external reviewer and one guest editor then wrote a review report, where the report of the latter was based on discussions between the two guest editors. Save for minor changes and the check for typo\u2019s, most papers were accepted after the first revision.",

The first paper in this special issue is written by Azizur Rahman, Ann Harding, Robert Tanton and Shuangzhe Liu. This paper discusses some key methodological elements of spatial microsimulation modelling, in particular reweighting. It introduces an iterative generalised regression algorithm known as GREGWT, and compares it with a synthetic reconstruction using a combinatorial optimisation technique. Besides being an interesting paper -we obviously hope they all are- and a good introduction into the methodological issues in spatial modelling, this paper is highly relevant to those developing dynamic models with static ageing for whatever application. The second paper by Robert Tanton and Yogi Vidyattama is highly complementary to the Rahman et al. paper. It takes the discussion one step further by highlighting the benefits and limits of the generalized regression reweighting method in particular by adding benchmarks or limit the sample being used in the estimations.",

In general, alignment can be seen as a method to reach consistency with beliefs about the future, and elimination of stochastic variation. Richard suggests one alignment and two matching methods, which may help meet present and new needs for microsimulation models. Furthermore, he warns that state alignment is much harder to do than event alignment, and being over-ambitious can cause severe distortions.",

The authors also share with us their rich experience gained from the validation of APPSIM.",

In that, validation is a key element in the development of a model. This paper is one of the few giving validation the attention it deserves. Also, the authors discuss the alignment of dynamic models. In recent years, alignment is no longer seen as a \u2018patch\u2019 to cover for weaknesses in the model, but as a way to make the model more flexible and therefore useful.",

The method builds on methodologies used in other models, particularly in Sweden, Canada and Australia and focuses in particular on defining the algorithms used.",

It is an unusual paper since it interprets the subject of this special issue as the methodology of managing changes to the models themselves. As models are generally used for many years after they are launched, it is essential that strong maintenance procedures and project governance structures are put in place. Sally draws from her own experience when describing examples of structured Change Control processes, and this makes the paper very interesting and useful for a wider audience that even goes beyond micro simulation modellers.",
