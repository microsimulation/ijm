Microsimulation modeling of health policies in other advanced industrial countries, where uninsurance rates have been much lower and approaches to coverage have been more settled, appear to focus more directly on the impacts of changes in benefit design and financial arrangements, or specific medical or public health interventions, on costs and health outcomes.

Treating them as endogenous may add realism to the simulation at the price of increased complexity. In the context of this simulation realism would be gained for attributes that have been empirically shown to be jointly determined with health insurance, as in the case of labor supply. Analysis of the literature on the relationship between health insurance and labor supply suggests that by treating labor supply as exogenous we might slightly underestimate the size of the Individual Exchange market and overestimate the one of the ESI market (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gruber &amp; Madrian 2004</a>). However, it also shows that we are far from having the knowledge sufficient to model reliably the joint choice of health insurance and labor supply. Therefore in the COMPARE framework individuals do not choose whether to enter the workforce or their occupation, but rather are assigned these statuses, as well as their income. Similarly, the entire regulatory system, which determines the choice sets for individuals, families and firms\u2013for example eligibility for public insurance, or the payment of a penalty for firms that do not offer health insurance\u2013are exogenous, as is the tax system.",

For example, individuals and firms will receive information about what initial premiums have been set, and are then allowed to revise the values of these attributes taking into account the values of the endogenous attributes of the other agents, and broadcast again the updated values. This procedure is iterated as many times as needed in order to reach a stable equilibrium. We define a convergence criterion that allows labeling a configuration of the system as the stable equilibrium, which is defined as the \u201cstatus quo.\u201d A crucial feature of the COMPARE microsimulation is that the status quo configuration must provide a realistic picture of the United States at a point in time. This means that the insurance premiums determined endogenously must match, with reasonable accuracy, the premiums that are actually observed.

As another example, COMPARE allows for the effects of adverse selection to operate dynamically affecting premiums and enrollment until an equilibrium is reached.

We further adjust the Kaiser/HRET data to reflect the number of firms enumerated in the Survey of U.S. Businesses (SUSB) (2005), stratified by firm size.

Elasticity-based approaches use empirical elasticities for different types of insurance to predict how insurance take-up will change with changes in price, or premiums. Elasticities are defined as percentage change in demand given a percentage change in price. In contrast, utility maximization approaches define the value or \u201cutility\u201d of each insurance option for each agent. Elasticity-based approaches have the advantage that they are straightforward to estimate. On the other hand, because these approaches rely heavily on parameters estimated under current policy, they are likely to perform best when changes to insurance policy are small (<a href=\"#bib3\">Abraham 2012</a>). Utility maximization can be a more flexible approach to estimate insurance take-up under a dramatically reformed system. <a href=\"#s8\">Section 8</a> describes similarities and differences between the results generated using the COMPARE model, which uses a utility maximization approach, and the CBO model, which uses an elasticity-based approach.",

The baseline reform simulation considered in our analysis was designed to reflect the main provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In scenario testing we analyzed the sensitivity of results to key design features and model assumptions. We conducted analyses to test the sensitivity of results to design choices that have yet to be fully determined, to estimate the degree of uncertainty stemming from modeling assumptions, and to assess the importance of key components of the law, including employer penalties and individual mandates. In particular, we modeled the effect of exchange implementation choices that must be made by states, such as whether to permit large businesses to offer coverage on the Exchanges, and whether to segregate the non-group and small group markets (risk pools) within the Exchanges. Although the coverage expansion provisions in the Affordable Care Act take effect in 2014, we assumed\u2013as the Congressional Budget Office did\u2013that it will take two years before they achieve their full impact. Penalties for not having coverage, for example, are phased in during 2014 and 2015 before reaching their permanent levels in 2016. Thus, the year 2016 can be considered the first \u201cequilibrium\u201d year in that, subsequently, outcomes related to cost and coverage are stable, with any fluctuations stemming primarily from changes in population demographics. Our simulation results are typically shown for years 2014, 2015, and 2016.",

Second, both predict substantial enrollment in the individual exchanges in 2016\u2013more than 20 million\u2013with only a small two percent difference between the two results (RAND estimates are four million higher than CBO\u2019s). Third, both predict either a negligible (RAND) or small (CBO) decline in ESI coverage due to the ACA. However, there are disagreements about the no-ACA enrollment levels in Medicaid (33 vs. 46 million) and employer-sponsored insurance or ESI (161 vs. 154 million).",

                    "text": "There are three reasons for these differences. The first two directly apply to the disagreements noted above on no-ACA results. First, it is difficult to accurately estimate status-quo enrollment figures for Medicaid and for the non-group market in the U.S. For example, often Medicaid enrollment survey data does not agree with the administrative data that is collected by state Medicaid programs. Misreporting in the original survey data is corrected by different modeling teams by applying different adjustment strategies. Inaccuracies in Medicaid and non-group enrollment figures affect the estimates for other coverage sources, since the sum of the covered and of the uninsured has to be equal to the U.S. population <sup><a href=\"#fn15\">15</a></sup> (either to the total population as in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a> or to the total non-elderly population, as in <a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a>). Second, surveys like the SIPP often list a substantial amount of the population as having dual insurance in the status quo. Both COMPARE and CBO assign a single insurance status to each individual and use a prioritization scheme, or hierarchy, for this assignment. CBO documentation does not specify the prioritization scheme that is used, but differences in baseline estimates suggest that it may be different from that adopted in COMPARE. Third, CBO uses a regression-based approach to model individuals\u2019 and firms\u2019 behavioral responses while COMPARE is based on a utility maximization framework. This methodological difference could explain some differences between the model outputs, though it is not clear what specific modeling results are affected.",

COMPARE can estimate enrollment in public programs such as Medicaid and CHIP and participation in the non-group and group markets and in the newly created insurance Exchanges, as well as uninsurance rates for the U.S. and for specific states.

However, a recent ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States allows states to decide whether they want to proceed with the Medicaid expansion. This state level decision will have important consequences. A state opting out of the expansion will be forgoing a large amount of federal Medicaid matching funds (<a href=\"#bib42\">Price &amp; Eibner 2013a</a>). Moreover, depending on current state-specific Medicaid eligibility rules, many poor individuals may end up being uninsured. COMPARE can be used to model these decisions for particular states (<a href=\"#bib19\">Price <i>et al</i>., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Price &amp; Eibner 2013b</a>).",

In the microsimulation, elderly people are allowed to participate in the insurance decisions of their HIEU\u2019s but their status as Medicare participants is not altered. Furthermore, projecting health care costs for the Medicare program is not currently part of COMPARE. The COMPARE team is planning to expand the capabilities of the microsimulation so that the insurance decisions of the elderly vis-\u00e0-vis Medicare and other options as well as Medicare cost growth can be accounted for in the model. The COMPARE team will also model the reforms that under the Affordable Care Act are intended to curb the cost growth of this program.",

As administrative data on enrollment in the Exchanges and Medicaid become available, we will be able to recalibrate COMPARE to more accurately reproduce individual decisions in baseline simulations, and thus to estimate the impact of alternative policies with greater confidence. A new longitudinal SIPP panel will be fielded in Spring 2014, with data on 2013 coverage scheduled for public release about a year later, and data on 2014 coverage scheduled for public release in 2016. The new SIPP data will make it possible to capture the early effects of the Affordable Care Act on employer-sponsored coverage as well as on Medicaid, CHIP, Medicare, and nongroup coverage through the Exchanges, and we look forward to drawing on these new survey data to improve COMPARE\u2019s microsimulation of health coverage in the U.S..",
