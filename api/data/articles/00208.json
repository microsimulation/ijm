                "text": "This paper introduces the Hypothetical Household Tool (HHoT), a new extension of EUROMOD, the tax-benefit microsimulation model for the European Union. With HHoT, users can easily create their own hypothetical data, which enables them to better understand how policies work for households with specific characteristics. The tool creates unique possibilities for an enhanced analysis of taxes and social benefits in Europe by integrating results from population-based microsimulations and hypothetical household simulations in a single modelling framework. Furthermore, the flexibility of HHoT facilitates an advanced use of hypothetical household simulations to create new comparative policy indicators in the context of multi-country and longitudinal analyses. In this paper, we highlight the main features of HHoT, its strengths and limitations, and illustrate how it can be used for comparative policy analysis.",

Traditionally, EUROMOD is used for analysing the distributive, labour market and budgetary impact of tax-benefit policies and policy changes. To do so, detailed and representative data on persons and households are required. With the HHoT extension, users can create their own hypothetical data, which allows them to better understand how policies work for households with specific characteristics, while giving them full control over the characteristics of interest. This creates unique possibilities for an enhanced analysis of taxes and social benefits in Europe by integrating results from hypothetical household simulations and population-based microsimulations in a single modelling framework. The flexibility of HHoT facilitates the simulation of a range of comparative indicators such as the marginal effective tax rate, the net replacement rate and unemployment or inactivity traps for a large set of hypothetical households in a comparative setting.",

In the case of tax-benefit simulation, these households and their specifications are used to compute the households\u2019 tax liabilities and benefit entitlements as well as detailed information on income components and total disposable income. In contrast to hypothetical household simulations, population-based microsimulation makes use of representative microdata (eg, collected in a household survey or from tax registers and social security registers) for which tax liabilities and benefit entitlements are computed, thus taking into account the full heterogeneity of household characteristics in the population<sup>[<a href=\"#fn1\">1</a>]</sup>.",

(1) Given that users can fully control the characteristics of hypothetical data, it is possible to generate indicators of the institutional functioning of tax-benefit systems that are independent of cross-national or longitudinal variations in population characteristics (eg, regarding work incentives, benefit generosity, income adequacy, targeting, replacement rates, implicit equivalence scales), thus allowing for a comparative analysis of the institutional structure of tax-benefit systems that isolates the effect of tax-benefit policies from the composition of the population. This is particularly relevant when evaluating policies that can have a non-negligible impact on the characteristics of the population. For instance, when studying work incentives of tax-benefit policies, the incidence of certain household types and work patterns themselves are likely to be influenced by the work incentives that flow from these tax-benefit policies. If this results in a relatively low incidence of household compositions and work behaviours that are financially discouraged, population-based simulations might not be able to reveal, or risk to downplay, the discouraging incentives that result from the tax-benefit system, given the low incidence of these situations in the data. Hypothetical household simulations are particularly useful for describing tax-benefit systems across countries with different policy designs. Microsimulation analysis using population-based data may put less weight on policies that encourage certain demographic behaviours (eg, two-earner orientated policies), whereas this becomes more clear when using similar household types across countries. (2) For the same reason, it is possible to illustrate in an accessible way for very simple (or rather complex) households how tax-benefit systems operate and how policies interact with each other. This allows users to grasp more easily how tax-benefit systems (or potential policy reforms) work and facilitates the validation of tax-benefit calculations. (3) Given that users generate their own hypothetical households, it is possible to assess the functioning of tax-benefit policies when adequate representative household data are lacking. For instance, this applies to studying households that are too rare in household samples for a reliable statistical analysis (eg, single-parent families with three or more children under the age of 7); and to situations when very up-to-date simulations are required (representative survey data or register data typically become available with quite some delay); or when aspects of policies require variables which are unavailable in the dataset (eg, on health or assets).",

(2004)</a> for a discussion of some limitations of hypothetical household analysis). In other words, they cannot show the aggregated impact of policies or policy reforms at the population level, eg, in terms of poverty, inequality, budgetary effects, or overall labour market participation. This can only be done on the basis of representative household data (either through a sample or population data) and, when analysing the impact on eg, labour supply, in combination with a behavioural model. Thus, population-based microsimulation is required whenever researchers want to say something about the effect on a population, rather than describing the institutional architecture of tax-benefit systems. It stands out, though, that in many cases hypothetical household simulations and population-based microsimulations are complementary to each other. For instance, when studying a reform related to the progressivity of taxation it is useful to see how progressive personal income taxes are in relation to the population under study and how a change impacts different parts of the population. However, given that results depend on the composition of the population under consideration, when comparing countries it is useful to complement such an analysis with an analysis of how different systems would perform for the same set of (hypothetical) households. Both approaches can also generate different indicators of closely related phenomena (eg, hypothetical household simulations of the extent to which social assistance benefits reach the poverty threshold, jointly with a study of social assistance coverage and non-take-up). So far though, most comparative studies either make use of one approach or the other, rather than using them jointly in a synergetic way, because models are either based on population-based or on hypothetical household data. With HHoT integrated in EUROMOD, the same tax-benefit model can be used for both population-based microsimulation and hypothetical household simulations, in a single framework, implying that it is much easier to combine the strengths of both approaches. Furthermore, EUROMOD allows doing this in a comparative context (multiple countries and/or years) as well as analysing the effect of policy reforms rather than just the status quo.",

Population-based microsimulation studies require the availability of (comparable) representative household microdata with sufficient information to assess tax liabilities and benefit entitlements. Such data have only been available since the late 1990s in many EU countries.

The main drawback of these databases is that they contain information for a limited number of cases, and simulations are hard-wired: one cannot assess what would happen if the policy rules were changed. Furthermore, updating is typically done in a more ad-hoc way given that it is rather demanding to generate the data (see, for instance, <a href=\"#bib18\">Marx and Nelson (2013)</a>, for a more detailed description and applications of the use of these databases). An exception to these two limitations is the OECD Tax-Benefit Calculator, which is specifically designed to carry out hypothetical household simulations for tax-benefit policies, in a flexible and user-friendly environment (eg, <a href=\"#bib12\">Immervoll, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">OECD, 2014</a>)<sup>[<a href=\"#fn2\">2</a>]</sup>.

Family types, the income situation and the percentage of the average wage can be changed easily. Previous versions of EUROMOD already included a basic tool to simulate tax-benefit rules for hypothetical households. Compared to the OECD tool, HHoT/EUROMOD has the advantage that it allows for integrating population-based and hypothetical household simulations in a single modelling framework, and that it is more flexible in terms of specifying household characteristics and the simulation of policy reforms. At the same time, this flexibility implies that the tool is also less accessible than the OECD online calculator for those not familiar with EUROMOD.",

As a result, EUROMOD is characterised by a drive for comparable policy modelling and the use of largely comparable and detailed microdata (now mostly EU-SILC). The scope of the simulated tax-benefit policies is limited to parameters for which the household data provide sufficient information. Consequently, policies that require longitudinal information on contribution records are not simulated (in particular contributory pensions). The model is built and maintained by a group of researchers from universities, research institutes and ministries from all EU countries under the coordination of a team of researchers at the University of Essex<sup>[<a href=\"#fn3\">3</a>]</sup>. Continuing support from the European Commission ensures regular updates of the model (policy rules) and the data (<a href=\"#bib25\">Sutherland and Figari, 2013</a>).

However, it was not very flexible: there were strong limits on the extent to which household characteristics could be manipulated. To enlarge the possibilities of hypothetical household simulations with EUROMOD, we designed the Hypothetical Household Tool \u2013 HHoT.

In the case of advanced variables, users have full control over all characteristics that are used in the simulations.

The examples are drawn from various strands of research and make use of different household specifications to show the flexibility of HHoT. In the first example we show how hypothetical household simulations can complement insights from population-based microsimulations in the case of a simple policy reform. In subsequent illustrations, we only present results based on hypothetical household simulations, even though there could be complementarities with population-based microsimulations. In the second example, we identify the gross wage level that is required to reach the level of the poverty line in a selection of EU-countries. This exercise makes use of the option to vary flexibly the range of gross income for each household member. Then we calculate implicit equivalence scales of the tax-benefit system in four EU-countries, showing that with HHoT it is also very easy to change other household characteristics, such as household composition. In the last exercise we show the marginal effective tax rates for all EU-countries and explain some of the differences across countries and income levels.

Reforming child benefits (Kindergeld) can reduce the at-risk-of-poverty rate for families with children. We simulate a simple reform aimed at reducing child poverty in single parent families in Germany to illustrate how hypothetical household simulations and population-based microsimulations can jointly help to design and understand policies. With the current child benefit system, the level of child benefit depends on the rank of the child in the family. In 2016, the level of the child benefit was 190 euro per month for the first and second child, 196 euro per month for the third and 221 euro per month for all other children. The benefit is paid to one of the parents. Child benefits are non means-tested, non-taxable benefits. At the same time, child benefits are part of the definition of income that is used for the income test of Unemployment Benefit II (<i>Arbeitslosengeld II</i>), social assistance related benefit (<i>Sozialhilfe</i>) and general social assistance. Apart from child benefits, families with children are entitled to a tax allowance for children. This allowance is only granted to parents if it is more beneficial to receive the tax allowance than the child benefit and is mostly relevant to higher income households. A third benefit that aims at improving the financial situation of families with children is the additional child benefit (Kinderzuschlag). The additional child benefit is, in contrast to the <i>Kindergeld</i>, means-tested. To be eligible for the additional child benefit, households also need to be eligible for <i>Kindergeld</i>. (eg, <a href=\"#bib5\">Gallego Granados and Harnisch, 2017</a>). In the reform that we simulate below, we focus on the design of the child benefits only.

The hypothetical household simulations make it easier for researchers and policy-makers to understand how the tax-benefit system operates and how the policies interact with each other. Besides, they help researchers and policy-makers to grasp the effect on vulnerable groups that might be underrepresented in the microdata. However, the hypothetical households are not representative for the population. Using a representative sample of the population we calculate the first-order poverty effects of this reform. <a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a> shows poverty headcounts for the baseline and the reform scenario and the difference between the two. Even though the hypothetical household simulations make clear that for some household types disposable income would be substantially increased, the overall (first order) effect on poverty in Germany is not significant. In contrast, the poverty risk of persons living in single parent households decreases significantly at the 90% confidence level, which was the objective of the reform. For persons living in households consisting of two adults and at least one child there is a small, but significant increase in the poverty risk. Focussing on the at-risk-of poverty rate we could conclude that this reform improves the income situation of lone parents with low incomes. HHoT however, allowed us to easily disentangle the effects for active and inactive households and to see the interaction between the child benefits and the means-tested benefit that might be hidden in microsimulation results based on population-data.",

Given that the threshold is set at 60 percent of the national median equivalent disposable household income, it may be difficult to grasp the kind of living standard that is feasible in each member state with an income at the level of the threshold (<a href=\"#bib8\">Goedem\u00e9 et al., 2019</a>). By using the flexibility of HHoT, it is relatively easy to identify at which wage level a household can have a disposable income at the level of the poverty threshold. This is helpful for further contextualising the at-risk-of-poverty indicator, ie, to make clear what the implications are of using a relative poverty threshold specified in this way. Also, more information on the required gross wage level to reach the at-risk-of-poverty threshold could help to better understand quantitative analyses of (cross-country variations in) in-work poverty. As the simulations below show, the required wage does not only depend on the level of the poverty threshold, but also on the applicable tax liabilities and benefit entitlements. Importantly, when interpreting the results it should be kept in mind that wage levels vary in non-negligible ways in the population (eg, by gender and level of education). This implies that it would be worthwhile to complement the analysis with an alternative set of reference wages.",

In a first step we calculate the 60% at-risk-of-poverty threshold on the basis of EU-SILC, with net incomes simulated by EUROMOD<sup>[<a href=\"#fn7\">7</a>]</sup>. In a second step, we use HHoT and EUROMOD to calculate the disposable income for hypothetical households earning a predetermined percentage of the average wage, which we vary between 60% and 200%. Average gross wages per full-year, full-time equivalent employee refer to 2014 and were downloaded from the OECD database (<a href=\"#bib21\">OECD, 2017</a>). In a third step we identify the gross wage level which corresponds with a disposable income at, or just above, the level of the poverty threshold. As illustrated in <a href=\"#table5\">Table 5</a>, simulations are carried out for a hypothetical single-person household consisting of a 35 years old male, working full time. The second hypothetical household is a married couple, 35 years old, both working full time. They have two children aged 5 and 8 years old. For the couple-household, we assume both partners are working, and we vary the gross income of both partners from 60% to 200% of the average gross wage. To do this, we imported a separate table in HHoT containing the average gross wages that we downloaded from the OECD online database. Different combinations of the gross wages of both parents are possible; in this exercise we select the income that results in a total disposable household income closest to, but above the poverty threshold<sup>[<a href=\"#fn8\">8</a>]</sup>.",

In Poland, Estonia, France and Hungary a single person working full time requires a gross income of around 80% of the average wage or more to reach the threshold. In contrast, in Portugal, Italy, Ireland and Greece 60% of the gross average wage suffices to reach an income just above the poverty line. Despite the relative character of the poverty threshold, this is quite a substantial difference. A similar observation can be made for two-earner couples (both working full time) with two children, even though countries score differently as compared to single-person households. While a single person in Hungary should earn about 85% of the average gross wage to reach the threshold, a couple with two children requires a total level of earnings of about 150% of the average gross wage, although the at-risk-of-poverty threshold of a household with two children is 2.1 times as high as the threshold for a single-person household. Compared to the other countries, the (relatively small) difference between the gross wage for a single person and the total gross wage for a couple with two children is remarkable. This shows how the Hungarian tax-benefit system favours couples with children compared to singles (see also Example three below). At the other extreme, in Portugal a couple with two children should earn about 130% of the average gross wage, while 65% of the average gross wage suffices for a single-person household. In Hungary an important part of the increase in disposable income is due to an increase in benefits, whereas in Portugal the impact of benefits is rather small. Also, the effect of the tax system (through joint taxation for couples such as in France, or tax advantages for families with children such as in Italy) can explain differences between countries. A recent similar exercise, done by the OECD on \u2018working hours needed to exit poverty\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib22\">OECD, 2019</a>), leads to a comparable conclusion that the design of tax-benefit policies is of great importance when comparing low-income families across countries. More specifically, it is the variation in the implicit equivalence scale of tax-benefit policies which drives the variation in the additional gross wage required by couples with children as compared to single person households to have a net income above the poverty line, a topic to which we turn in the next example.",

However, these comparisons are limited by the fact that hours worked and wage levels tend to be partially determined by household composition. This implies that it is difficult to judge from these results alone how tax-benefit systems support different household types. For this reason, it can be revealing to calculate \u2018implicit equivalence scales\u2019 based on hypothetical data. For the purposes of this exercise, we define the implicit equivalence scale of a tax-benefit system as the extent to which a tax-benefit system treats multi-person households of different size and composition more favourably than a single person household with the same level of gross earnings, in terms of taxes to be paid and eligibility for receiving social benefits. It is typically measured as the ratio of the disposable income of two households that have the same gross wage and similar other characteristics, except for the demographic composition of the household. This shows how policies work in their pure form, and can help to better understand, for instance, the distribution of poverty risks by household type. The calculations are similar to those done in the previous exercise, but now we compare more directly incomes between household types with a similar level of gross income. Further breakdowns can show how not only the level, but also the composition of net incomes differs by household type as a result of tax-benefit policies such that one can identify the policies that drive the implicit equivalence scales.",

For this exercise, the income ranges are based on the average wages calculated using the EUROMOD microdata files (based on EU-SILC). When comparing net incomes between two household types, wages are kept constant. In principle it is desirable to keep also all other characteristics \u2018constant\u2019, in spite of the changing composition of the household. Given the availability and setup of housing-related benefits in some countries, housing costs are an important issue in this context. In principle, one could opt for keeping housing costs constant across household types, but this is often not a realistic assumption. Therefore, in this example we started from the level of housing costs that were estimated in another project. More in particular, we made use of the housing cost associated with renting an adequate dwelling on the private market at the 30<sup>th</sup> percentile of the distribution of housing costs for the relevant household composition, in the relevant region (<a href=\"#bib26\">Van den Bosch et al., 2016</a>). In the case of a more in-depth analysis, it would be worthwhile to undertake sensitivity tests with alternative assumptions regarding housing costs, as we will show below.",

The households are one-earner households, in the case of couples one partner is assumed to be inactive on the labour market. With HHoT it is easy to make variations for more complex households, but we limit ourselves in this illustration to households with one child. Several observations stand out. First, when looking at differences within countries between different levels of earnings, it is clear that implicit equivalence scales are generally above one and higher for inactive persons and for households with lower wages<sup>[<a href=\"#fn9\">9</a>]</sup>. This probably has a mitigating effect on poverty for multi-person households living on a low income, even though the size of the effect will vary by the poverty measure used<sup>[<a href=\"#fn10\">10</a>]</sup>. In contrast, in all four countries included in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, the implicit equivalence scale at 200% of the average wage is broadly similar to the implicit equivalence scale for households with earnings at 100% of the average wage. While in Greece and Hungary equivalence scales are higher for inactive households as compared to working households earning 50% of the average wage (both for adding a partner or a child), in Belgium the implicit equivalence scale for adding an inactive partner is lower than the scale for adding a partner in a working low-income household (without a child). Second, countries vary strongly in the level of implicit equivalence scales, and the ranking of the four countries differs substantially depending on the household composition under consideration. It is noteworthy that in Italy adding a partner to a single-person household does not make a difference for the tax-benefit system, while adding a child does make a difference. For working families in Belgium and Hungary the implicit equivalence scales of the tax-benefit system are higher for an additional partner as compared to a child, while in Greece and Italy it is the other way around. This shows how the tax-benefit systems across the four countries result in different outcomes in the degree to which they support (or do not support) households with a different demographic composition. Apart from showing how these tax-benefit systems operate, more insight into implicit equivalence scales can also help to better understand varying patterns of poverty and inequality.",

Therefore, in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a> we describe the different income components that increase the income for a family with a child compared to a family without a child (note that given our focus on child-related tax-benefit generosity, we use the income of a couple without a child in the denominator in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). More specifically, it shows the difference in the level of each income component (when adding a child), expressed as a percentage of the net income of a similar household without a child, at a similar level of gross earnings. Not surprisingly, child benefits tend to account for most of the difference, while social contributions are no different for households with a child as compared to those without a child. Additional advantages for a single-person households with a child can include both support directed to lone parents specifically, or to households with children more generally. As an exception, for inactive households in Belgium and households earning 50% of the average gross wage in Greece the increase of the net income is mostly due to a higher level of social assistance benefits, especially for single-parent households, compared to single-person households the difference in social assistance in the tax-benefit package is much smaller for couples. Even though the contribution of personal income taxes is significant at higher levels of earnings (especially for couples with a child), it is relatively small, and non-existent in Greece. In Hungary the housing allowance also varies by household composition, resulting in higher benefits for households with a child.",

One way to look at tax-benefit systems is to analyse to what extent they encourage their workforce to take up a job (work incentive on the extensive margin) and to what extent they encourage to work/earn more (work incentive on the intensive margin). In this example, we focus on the marginal effective tax rate (METR) which measures the (dis)incentive to work/earn more, expressed as the share of an earnings increase that is taxed away due to higher social insurance contributions, higher taxes, or the loss of benefit entitlement. We assume a 3% earnings increase in our calculations using the methodological approach suggested by <a href=\"#bib14\">Jara and Tumino (2013)</a>. METRs usually take values between 0 and 100, indicating respectively high work incentives when individuals keep the full earnings increase and low incentives when individuals lose the full earnings increase. However, certain aspects of the tax-benefit system might also lead to higher or lower values. We visualise how different elements of the tax-benefit system react to the 3% earnings increase.",

The reason for averaging over 41 cases either side of the mean instead of using the example of an average earner is based on the sensitivity of METRs which can differ a lot between an average earner and someone earning slightly above or below average earnings. This is due to kinks in the tax and benefit schedule, where an earnings increase of 3% more can lead to a significant increase in taxes/social insurance contributions (SIC) or the loss of tax credits or benefits in some countries. Thus, using the average METR of a certain earnings range produces results that are more in line with results based on representative data (see Supplementary data in <a href=\"#bib6\">Gasior and Recchia, 2019</a>).",

This, however, corresponds to a very specific case in which the baseline earnings represent roughly the minimum wage and the 3% earnings increase leads to earnings above this level. While earnings below the minimum wage are disregarded from the income test for the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI), this is not the case for the earnings increase which leads to a slightly smaller benefit amount which creates a high disincentive to work more. All other income groups have incomes above the GMI and hence, are no longer eligible to receive the means-tested benefit. While the deducted SIC of the earnings increase amount to 7.8% of gross earnings across all income groups, only average and above earners are liable to income tax (which subsequently leads to higher METRs). The income tax paid for the earnings increase is progressive, starting at 18% for average earners, and going up to 28% for those with earnings that are twice as high. Nevertheless with the exception of earnings above 150% of average earnings, METRs for earnings above the Minimum Wage are substantially lower than in other countries.",

Disincentives are especially high for those with 50% of average earnings due to the high level of social insurance contributions. While the contribution of the income tax increases relatively smoothly up to earnings levels of 125% of average earnings, the contribution of SIC to the METRs is highest for those with 45%\u201370% of average earnings. This is due to the work bonus which has two parts. The first part is a reduction of SIC, the second part is a tax bonus for monthly gross earnings below \u20ac 2,510. Higher earnings lead to a lower work bonus and hence to a slightly higher income tax than before the earnings increase. In other words, when the work bonus is reduced, this reduction does not only apply to the increase in earnings, but to total earnings, which is why the METR is particularly high at this level of earnings.",

In relative terms, taxes and SIC deductions are the same across earnings levels (even for those with earnings below the minimum wage). Only certain household types (eg, households with children) are eligible for tax allowances and are subject to lower deductions. In contrast to Cyprus and Belgium, low earnings are not exempted from contributions. This creates the same METR of 35% for all earnings levels. While increases in earnings are largely taxed away by the income tax system in Belgium and Cyprus, SIC play a relatively more important role in Hungary.",

The selected country cases demonstrate different levels of METR and the contribution of different tax and benefit elements. It furthermore highlights the importance of taking different earnings levels into account rather than just focusing on average earnings. Even with this simple one-person household example, results are quite different by country and earnings levels. The possibilities to expand such analysis are unlimited by for example focusing on different household compositions and analysing the role of tax allowances and means-tested benefits for these households.",

The tool is unique in that it is very flexible, yet user-friendly, and \u2013 as part of EUROMOD \u2013 allows for comparable population-based microsimulations and hypothetical household simulations in an integrated framework. Given that EUROMOD covers all EU Member States, for an increasing number of policy years, the tool has great potential to substantially contribute to (comparative) research in tax-benefit policies. In addition, EUROMOD is supported by a network of experts, responsible for regular updates and validations of the tax-benefit simulation model, ensuring the quality and timeliness of the simulations. In this paper, we introduced HHoT and described its potential for novel research in tax-benefit policies and for producing policy indicators. The uses and the advantages of the tool are manifold. HHoT can enhance tax-benefit analyses and studies of poverty and inequality with illustrations of how policies work and interact with each other in practice. It can also illustrate how proposed policy reforms and reform ideas would work and interact with other policies. Second, it can help users to create (new) policy indicators that keep the composition of the population constant across time and countries, for instance on benefit adequacy and generosity, targeting, implicit equivalence scales and work incentives (for an example of a new indicator, see <a href=\"#bib23\">Penne et al. (2020)</a>). Thirdly, HHoT can be used to go beyond the possibilities of the microdata to study the operation and impact of policy parameters for which variables are lacking in the microdata or in cases where specific households are underrepresented in the microdata. An additional advantage for EUROMOD specifically, is that HHoT helps to validate the tax-benefit algorithms in the model in a very detailed way and without the constraints of data availability. Finally, it is also a valuable tool for introducing new users to EUROMOD and helping them setting the first steps in microsimulation modelling.",

However, users should be aware that it is always necessary to reflect upon the validity of assumptions and the quality of the simulations made, especially in the case of comparative research, and not be tempted to jump all too quickly to (policy) conclusions. With this caveat in mind, we hope that users will quickly embrace the potential that HHoT offers to generate new insights into the functioning and impact of tax-benefit policies.",
