Universal pensions would significantly reduce poverty and inequality in settings where no means-tested old-age pensions exist (such as in Ghana and Tanzania). If means-tested old-age pensions exist and shall be maintained, universal pensions as a top up scheme only make a difference for the income distribution if the existing schemes do not reach the entire vulnerable population such as in Ecuador. Costs for the proposed schemes are substantial.",

Our choice of countries allows us to illustrate the hypothetical introduction of a uniform policy, an old-age universal pension, in four distinct settings. The four countries chosen are at different points in their economic development, three of them facing a stark increase in the share of the dependent elderly population, raising concerns regarding social protection for the elderly. The more economically advanced countries (Ecuador and South Africa) feature means-tested benefits for the elderly for the years analysed; but while the existing means-tested benefit in South Africa is rather loosely targeted and generous, the existing benefit in Ecuador is less generous and eligibility is based on a proxy means test (PMT).",

The models are also flexible in order to pick up one of the main conceptual differences between more or less developed countries when looking at distribution measures: while in the developing world (as in Ghana and Tanzania) poverty and inequality are measured based on consumption, such measures are typically based on income data in more developed countries (as in Ecuador and South Africa).",

By contrast, the universal pension benefit is a lump-sum benefit (the amount of the poverty line) provided to all elderly. The authors conclude that a minimum pension reduces old-age poverty in all countries whenever a country has not implemented a universal minimum pension system. As expected, the poverty rates decline more in the case of universal pensions than in the minimum pension.

The reduction is larger among the over-65 years old population and particularly in rural areas in both countries. The largest reduction of poverty rates at 24.8 percentage points occurs among Peruvians 65 years or older who live in rural areas. They find no impact on inequality except among the elderly population in Peru. The costs of the universal pension scheme are 2.6 and 2.98 per cent of total tax revenues in Colombia and Peru. For Ecuador, <a href=\"#bib2\">Amores and Jara (2018)</a> show that increasing the existing targeted pension scheme in a revenue-neutral manner to match the level of the poverty line in Ecuador would reduce elderly poverty by 40 per cent and would take 18 per cent of old-age beneficiaries out of poverty.",

Also, the surveys for Ghana and Tanzania ask respondents to state the amount of pay they receive for their work and how often they are paid (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.). When converting incomes to yearly values a few cases show improbably high amounts, given respondents\u2019 education and skill level. In Tanzania the pattern is particularly salient for low-skilled respondents reporting an hourly or daily frequency of pay but with full-time work hours working throughout the full year. Classifying these cases as data entry issues, the payments were reclassified as monthly if the pay exceeded TZS 5,000 per day or TZS 100,000 per week. Furthermore, income was censored at the 99th percentile. A similar strategy was chosen for Ghana, where a small number of cases similarly exhibited an improbable mismatch between the frequency of pay, the amount paid, and the sector. Therefore the status of the job (private sector formally employed, publicly employed, non-agricultural self-employed, etc.) was used to censor improbable income values at the 99th percentile for each subgroup.",

This approach produces consumption poverty rates that are close to the measures based on consumption observed in the data (for example, 24.9 vs 24.2 per cent in Ghana). It is worth noting that even if consumption possibilities-based poverty would deviate more, this has limited implications for comparing poverty across scenarios: assuming that people would consume any additional income (which is rather likely in a developing country context), actual taxes and transfers would cancel out the difference between a reform scenario and the baseline scenario.",

The universal pension benefit amount as a share of equivalized consumption is above 25 per cent in any of the reform scenarios and reaches nearly 61 per cent in Tanzania for reform 3, where the benefit is the more generous and the age group larger (60 years or older) than under reforms 1 and 2. In both countries possible trickle-down effects to the rest of the household could be important as the elderly recipients live in households on average composed of more than four persons and often spanning three generations.",

In Ecuador, coverage and the universal pension as a share of the equivalized income diverge considerably between reforms under scenario 1 and scenario 2 (<a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a>). As coverage through a contributory scheme as recorded in the data is largest in Ecuador out of all countries analysed (no such information exists in the data for South Africa albeit contributory systems exist as discussed), the lowest share of the senior population, between 75 and 81 per cent, would receive the universal pensions in scenario 1 when substituting the existing means-tested system with a universal system. This drops to about half or one-third in scenario 2, where the existing means-tested benefit is maintained and the universal pension is provided as a top-up. As the lump-sum benefit of USD 50 provided in the existing scheme is larger than any of the benefits provided under the different reform scenarios, the universal pension covers exclusively those seniors that are not entitled to the means-tested benefit.",

Eligibility to the existing means-tested benefit is restricted to those scoring below a certain threshold value in the Social Registry, which is composed of not only income but also a host of other socio-economic variables. Thus, apart from limiting the scope of reach by fixing the threshold value, determinants other than the income situation determine eligibility. The universal benefit, by contrast, goes to everybody regardless of income and other socio-economic variables.

Yet, unlike in Ecuador, the benefit is targeted so loosely that the introduction of the universal benefit either has a large (scenario 1) or very little impact (scenario 2) on coverage and benefit amounts. In South Africa, coverage through the universal pension reaches 100 per cent of the relevant senior population when substituting the existing targeted system (scenario 1) as no contributory scheme as such is captured for South Africa in the data. Coverage by the hypothetical universal pension drops to between 11 and 14 per cent (reform 1 and reform 3) in scenario 2 where the existing, targeted Old Age Grant is maintained and topped up by the universal pension. The means-tested Old Age Grant benefit is loosely targeted and generous. The majority of the elderly population benefits and the benefit is slowly phased out until reaching the rather high upper eligibility threshold which is high compared to the benefits handed out in the reform scenario. In scenario 2 the majority of seniors therefore retain the means-tested benefit and the universal pension benefit goes only to the better-off part of the elderly population. This also shows in the impact of the universal pension on equivalized income; in scenario 1 the universal pension constitutes between 23.5 (reform 3) to 58.2 per cent (reform 1), thus a very substantial contribution under reform 1. Under scenario 2 this plummets to between 3 and 7.5 per cent as a comparatively much better-off group receives the universal pension that equals a considerably smaller part of their income.",

Expenditure on the universal pension as a share of government revenue is higher for Ghana and Tanzania than for Ecuador and South Africa, which is in line with greater domestic revenue mobilization capacities in the latter countries; the tax base in Ghana and in Tanzania is considerably smaller than in Ecuador, and especially compared to South Africa.

Also, for a given level of poverty reduction universal pension reforms, by definition, are substantially more costly than a perfectly targeted means-tested pension benefit. Comparing the cost of the universal pension with the poverty gap is thus a helpful exercise to contrast the cost of a universal pension benefit against the theoretical scenario of a perfectly targeted benefit. Across different reform schemes the costs for a universal pension are between half (reform 3, scenario 1, South Africa) and more than ten-fold the poverty gap (reform 1 and 3, Tanzania).",

In Ghana, expenditure for the most expensive reform stands at 18.36 per cent of total direct tax receipts (reform 1) and in Tanzania it stands at 33.09 per cent (reform 3), which is a massive share of tax revenue. Costs for the least expensive reform stand at 5.56 per cent of total direct tax receipts in Ghana and 7.83 per cent in Tanzania (both reform 2). In both countries it would obviously be much cheaper to close the poverty gap through perfect targeting instead of a universal pension. Yet, a well-targeted and transparent means-tested pension scheme is a challenging endeavour, potentially expanding administrative costs and bureaucracy significantly. A transparent and fair implementation may be near impossible if administrative data quality is mixed (see Section 2.3 for a discussion of difficulties in the implementation of targeted schemes).

Effects are substantial and their scope depends critically on whether the benefit amount is anchored to the NPL, the FPL, or the WBPL. In countries with existing means-tested minimum pensions, like Ecuador and South Africa, results differ markedly depending on the implementation of the universal pension. Substituting the existing loosely targeted generous means-tested old-age benefit with a universal pension increases poverty and inequality in South Africa. In Ecuador, where not all poor seniors are covered by the existing means-tested old-age benefit, the most generous of the studied universal pension reforms would lead to less poverty and inequality. If existing systems are maintained, top-up universal pension schemes considerably reduce poverty and inequality in Ecuador, but less so in South Africa given its generous and large-scope minimum pension. In sum, considering the implementation of a universal pension across these four different countries highlights the importance of taking into account the national context.",

Fully fledged microsimulation models, such as those employed here help to inform the debate regarding the details of how a specific policy (such as a universal pension) could be implemented and how it might interact with other parts of the tax code.

Furthermore, the results presented in this paper are based on static microsimulation models. We thus abstract from any behavioural changes that the introduction of a universal pension might have on people\u2019s behaviour. Behavioural responses to policy reforms is an area of ongoing research; in a developing country context, for example, <a href=\"#bib39\">Osei, Pirttil\u00e4, and Rattenhuber (forthcoming)</a> discuss one possible dimension of behavioural change when implementing a revenue-neutral expansion of social protection for Ghana. The role of administrative efficiency and capacity for the implementation and thus the cost of implementing different reforms is also an ongoing research area relevant to our work. As <a href=\"#bib55\">Wright <i>et al</i>. (2018)</a> show, transparency and clarity of social protection rules is another important area of research. Finally, deepening the comparability across countries, including more countries, and addressing the discrepancies between income- vs consumption-based distributional measures remain high on the research agenda.",
