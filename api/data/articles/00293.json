Long-term efficiency or stability depends upon how reliable these short-term market signals are for long-term decision making and /or how they are corrected and interpreted by individual firms, especially in the context of investment decisions. lt follows that the more orderly market price formation is, the more reliable are price signals. However, the ups and downs in relative and absolute prices in the model depend on volume responses to past relative and absolute price changes and other factors. We will be able to study the consequences of this when we replace the Swedish payroll tax completely with a value-added tax in one of the experiments to be reported on below. Structural changes in the micro specified sectors occur endogenously in response to relative price changes. Several coefficients in a corresponding macro model, for instance capital and labor elasticities in the production function, export price elasticities, and so on, would therefore not be constant. This paper reports on a series of experiments on tax parameter changes, that will illustrate this potential. Before this, however, I will give a verbal and diagrammatical presentation of the entire model and of its tax and income transfer system that has recently been introduced. Emphasis is placed on the role of the tax system in economy wide model behavior, notably how tax wedges in prices affect firm and macro systems behavior. We will also give some statistical highlights of the Swedish tax system.",

First, even though the model is capable of simulating extremely detailed output, we are not interested in predicting more detail. Our concern is with understanding economic systems dynamics and how it depends on firms' behavior in markets. To understand how markets influence macro large amounts of micro information that reflect the heterogeneity of firms and households commonly aggregated away in macro models is needed (<a href=\"#bib26\">Orcutt et al., 1976</a>). We need to study and to know the covariance structure of our micro units (firms), especially when it comes to getting our micro specification right. We expect a realistic micro-founded model to possess macro properties that are not explicit in conventional macro models. If our assumptions are right, we should take these unconventional properties seriously. Right or wrong is a genuine empirical question, and the only truly scientific response to it is to go out and check.<a href=\"#fn3\"><sup>3</sup></a> The reader will have the opportunity to decide for himself as he proceeds.",

Rather, we have opted for choosing the decision unit (the firm) as the economic agent and the observation unit. This makes it possibilities to model market processes explicitly at the micro level and to integrate micro and macro theory in a natural relying on explicit market processes as the medium of integration . Above all, however, this approach opens up a wealth of high-quality statistical micro information for direct use in improving our understanding of economic phenomena at the macro level.",

A novelty is that this model features complete economic systems wide feed backs of both income generation and Keynesian demand and expectational mistakes at the firm level. The firm model also draws heavily on empirical information from my own interview study on business economic planning systems in U.S. and European firms featuring firms as financially defined decision entities (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eliasson, 1976a</a>). Each firm integrates price expectations in product, labour and financial markets in their businbess plans. Firms of this model are typically <i>boundedly rational</i> in the sense of <a href=\"#bib29\">Simon (1959</a>) in that they use experience based expectations algorithms to interprete market price data generated by the model (see below) and thus have limlited but different understandings of their external market environment. If the firm model is simplified far enough it collapses into the neoclassical model of one firm as a production function, that however in our model faces a vector of prices that except for export markets are determined in the markets of the model from period to period by the competition of all firms. Another novelty in this model therefore is that the actions of all firms together in labor and product markets determine prices and wages endogenously in a sequential manner. Since the model cannot be solved for these prices each period, there exists no equilibrium state of the economy where all firms have edged themselves into combinations where markets are cleared and they are all satisfied to remain. Rather, if they try too hard to improve their profits (which is always possible) or if the market pushes them too hard (i.e., if the market allocation mechanisms are artificially made too fast and efficient), the entire economic system will eventually become destabilized.",

The stepwise decision sequence in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, furthermore, very much captures the iterative planning-realization-reporting round of the budget process. The model furthermore captures the typical use of of budgets as an internal negotiation process of an insufficiently informed top management to impose cost discipline on division managers by forcing them to reveal information about internal inefficiences that they would otherwise keep for themselves (MIP targeting see <a href=\"#bib12\">Eliasson, 1976a</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Eliasson, 1976b</a>). The iterations do not aim at maximizing profits. They stop when profit margins compatible with improved long-term profit performance of the past are met.

The model allows a grading of the intensity with which the firm tries to improve its profit position each period. We can, if we so wish, approximate profit-maximizing behavior in a static sense by pushing up margin targets above what has been historically accomplished under the restriction that expected profits in each firm, in money terms, each period (quarter) do not diminish. We cannot, however, solve the system for maximum profits. It is important to note here that the \u201cmaintain or improve profit margin principle (MIP)\" that we apply gives rise to firm behavior that is often quite similar to, but also sometimes principally different from that of the maximizing firm.<a href=\"#fn9\"><sup>9</sup></a> This should not be surprising, since if you remove all the interesting feedback dynamics of the model, and with that endogenous structural change, MIP profit targeting will approximate a slow long term ex ante wealth maximizing process of the firm, that will however have to be revised from period to period because the circumstances of this \u201cmaximizing process\u201d keeps changing endogenously, and often radically so, from period to period.",

The decision structure within the firm, as depicted in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, and the search order in the labor and product markets are most important. Profit targeting, for instance, has a strong impact on cyclical as well as long-run growth properties of the entire system. Feeding back information from the employment or inventory parts of the production system of the firm means less intensive enforcement of targets and results in very different behavior. Similarly, some simple experiments have shown that the way we loop together the sales expectations/ production planning, and inventory adjustments in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> can generate very different cyclical patterns. Since product, labor and financial market expectations are integrated withing the business plans of firms, the core of the integrated cyclical and growth dynamics of the entire model economy is defined by the links (over time and within <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) between price expectations and profit targeting on the one hand, and wage setting in the labor market and interest sensitive investment determination, on the other. Any change in the interlinking of these modules will strongly impact economy wide behavior. Perhaps the most illustrative example is when we close off labor market search between groups of firms or markets entirely. If relative product prices in foreign markets (exogenous) develop differently, a very uneven labor income distribution soon develops between closed-off sectors, and profit and growth patterns change significantly. This \u201ctheoretical\" property alone emphasizes the importance of the market price setting in total economic systems behavior and the need for more empirical research in this area. On the internal planning and decision structure of the firm the empirical specification is as well founded as it can be, owing to a 5-year interview study (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eliasson, 1976a</a>) that preceded this project and that has strongly influenced the design of the firm model. On the market side the availability of relevant, systematized information is embarrassingly scanty. This means that an effort to become more knowledgeable about wage setting and mobility in the labor market at the micro level is planned and will be designed on the format of the model.",

They are replaced by sequential orderings and feedbacks. The estimation problem centers on the 20 time-reaction parameters called X3 and exemplified above. One satisfactory property of these 20 parameters is that they can be grouped into some that operate only (or roughly so) on long term trends, some that affect the cycle only, and a residual group that affects both dimensions.

We are currently somewhat uncertain about the model\u2019s capability of catching short-term (quarter to quarter and year to year) change well. One satisfactory feature of the model, however, is that the 20 parameters can be grouped into some that operate only (or roughly so) on long term trends, some that affect cycles only and a group that affect both. One piece of observational evidence, which is comforting as regards realism on the cyclical side, is that exogenous step impulses (not large ones) in exogenous variables and policy parameters tend to spin off gradually dampened 4- to 6- year cycles in the model economy. This property has a bearing on the experiments to follow.",

This should be of special interest for two reasons. First, the share of total resources taken out by the public sector (50% of GNP in 1976), which is partly used up and partly redistributed, is one of the highest in the world. This means that even minor modifications in the tax structure may have sizable effects upon the economy. Second, the very heaviness of the average tax burden raises particular problems of tax evasion and control. For that reason, there has been a lively discussion about modifying the tax system or even changing it radically.",

We should recall that numerical consistency throughout at starting time has been found to be a critical prerequisite for the proper functioning of the model. We recall that the model forecasts historical, long-run growth trends of major macro variables well and prices, wages, and profits quite well, both in the short and the long runs. We think that we can fairly safely say that the results indicate what would have happened to a Sweden like economy over the 8-year period 1968 through 1975 if this or that fiscal measure had been enacted as described.

                            "text": "There are three important systems properties that we should mention before we proceed, since they explain some unexpected experimental results. First, under normal circumstances most firms hoard labor to some extent (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This means that firms experiencing a demand increase can increase supplies and productivity simultaneously for a while. This is a typical cyclical phenomenon. Only on the production frontier does productivity decrease as more labor is recruited to work with on the margin less productive machinery (above B in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We have learned from model experiments that individual firms only rarely operate on that end of their production frontiers, and these experimental results are supported by preliminary evidence from the Planning Survey of the Federation of Swedish Industries. Second, an exogenous step impulse tends to spin off a 4- to 6-year cycle in the model economy. The system hence behaves according to the Le Chatelier principle at least in some time dimensions. The initial effect in one direction will reverse itself through an endogenous counter-response of the system transmitted through price responses. These properties are conventionally assumed away in mainstream economic modeling that lack explicit markets: in Keynesian models through the absence of supply feedbacks and in neoclassical models through assumed perfect foresight. The property arises in this model through mistaken expectations, a consequent disturbed market price signaling system, and corrective effects on the rates of return, investment and capacity growth. Third, one particularly important instance of this property is that sudden, unexpected inflationary shocks (not necessarily large ones) tend to have long-lasting downward effects on economic growth after an initial positive effect.<a href=\"#fn22\"><sup>22</sup></a> lt is difficult to test for this property directly. So far, my own attempts to ascertain its relevance have however turned out evidence in the affirmative.<a href=\"#fn23\"><sup>23</sup></a> This property was furtheermore suggested by Professor Friedman in his 1976 Nobel lecture. Some econometric models report negative growth coefficients for the rate of change in the rate of inflation but this is too crude a test for the phenomenon we are discussing to be more than slightly helpful. <a href=\"#bib7\">Cagan's (1974)</a> results that common stock maintains its real value in the Iong run but that \"stocks may take many years to catch up to an inflationary episode\" (15 years is the median time in an international comparison) refer more directly to the machinery in our model and hence is more supportive.",

Industrial output is affected similarly. The initial first year (2nd and 3rd quarter) effects in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> depend on the habit-formation hypothesis embedded in the consumption system. The lowered purchasing power of households due to the increase in the value-added tax is buffered through less saving in the first round. It is interesting to notice that the two parameter changes result in output effects of similar magnitude (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In both cases, the employment level is back to the initial level in year 7 (1975). The value-added tax rate increase (<a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a>), furthermore, allows us to push wage change (and temporarily employment) down, gradually realizing an improvement in the return to investment.",

This is normal pricing behavior among firms. It is difficult to compensate for the tax by raising prices fast, and firms only reluctantly lower prices by the full amount of the reduction in the tax. This produces an asymmetrical profit response to value-added tax rate changes for the 7-year period of investigation that is supported by knowledge of firm pricing behavior. The higher price level (after tax) can be maintained for some time, and firms gain on selling more at home and relatively less in foreign markets. Export performance is coming down slowly from the third year and even though savings also decrease, the import effect persists. More import price competition hurts business profits, and firms begin to get tough on the wage side to satisfy their profit targets. The net impact is a worsened external balance, less domestic supplies in domestic markets (compared to the reference case) and a slowdown in industrial growth. Employment and real wages suffer in the medium term, but business profit margins are still maintained at a higher level by the end of the 7-year period, so the results correspond to rational responses by firms. We should note here that profit margins are on their way down strongly in 1975, probably to undershoot the reference case after a few years. This again underlines the new realistic and hence important feature of disequilibrium models of this kind. Depending upon initial conditions and the time period studied, the results may be very different. The possibility ty that the incidence and the allocation effects of changes in, for example, payroll tax rates may be very different depending on the cyclical situation is also emphasized in <a href=\"#bib25\">Normann and S\u00f6dersten (1978)</a>. A deflationary spiral sets in from the fourth year that works counter to the initial fiscal measure. Firms come out all right with higher profit margins, but output suffers slightly. This deflationary cycle is just about to reverse itself at the end of the 7-year period. Note also that employment recovers faster than output, and the reason of course is a lowering of real wages. The back side of this situation is a lower productivity growth than in the reference case. Quite in keeping with the dominant property of our model, this dynamic reversal is stronger and faster the larger the initial parameter change. The reason is that the early overoptimism generated by the fiscal stimulant has created overexpansive output and recruitment plans. Since profit targets are based on excessive price and sales expectations, wage drift was allowed to occur without violating ex ante targets. Firms then experienced profit disappointments ex post and consolidated their positions by laying off labor and pushing up profit margins at lower output levels. This is what normally happens in the early phases of a business recession, so in fact the initial boom, created by the fiscal stimulus, has generated its own \"extra\" slump after a few years, albeit a minor one.",

The results, however, only tell that growth is not the only way to maintain rates of return for firms, and when markets are not so competitive and when profits come easily, it may be better for firms to slow down investment and growth. The results depend in part on the degree of competition in markets but also in part on the feedback, profit-targeting device (maintain or improve profits-MIP) in the firm model. As a result of improved profit performance, firms upgrade their targets and vice versa. This set of propositions is difficult to test owing to the long time dimensions involved, but one has to remember that these unconventional results are conventionally assumed away in most econometric models. So, there is no need to question the results except on clear empirical evidence. A case in point here is <a href=\"#bib27\">Pratten's (1976)</a> results from comparisons of matched Swedish and British firms. He found that while British firms were far below their Swedish counterparts in productivity and growth rates, they attained higher rates of return. Again note (from <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) the second quarter temporary reversal of the GNP effects. It depends partly on households not adjusting their consumption immediately to their lower or higher real purchasing power; they prefer to take part of the adjustment by way of their savings account.",

This profit margin increase takes its time to generate more growth and employment through investment, and employment has just about recovered from the initial decrease in year 7.

In reality the transition will have to be intermediated by the imperfect information support of market prices. Since our model runs on a market-price information-response system, where performance of the total economic system depends on the ability of agents (decision makers) to interpret these signals. Compared to artificial general equilibrium analyses we can more realistically simulate such systemic transitions. Because of the market disturbances created by major and fast fiscal changes, they must be enacted in a gradual way. Even so we should expect some economic effects (a \u201ctransactions cost\u201d) of a negative nature to arise because of disturbances in the market information system, which demand a long time for firms to learn and correct for.

Furthermore, when the effect is negative, the cyclical swings generated in the durable goods producing industries are much stronger.

As should be expected the relationship is significantly positive. When the same relationship is extended to 1975, the regression line (shown by the solid line in the upper and the dashed line in the lower part of the figure) pivots for two reasons. The high-performance (in terms of profitability) firms essentially stay with their relatively higher rates of return for the longer period. Since they reached that position in the inflationary period 1972-1973 and have plowed back profits in investments, and/or have borrowed more to invest because of the higher rate of return, the higher growth in capacity that enters production with a delay explains part of the pivoting. However, some of the firms in the low-performance end have instead suffered, owing to the wage drift induced by the generally higher inflation that they have to share. This reinforces the pivoting in the left-hand end of the diagram. The discriminating impact on firms in different performance brackets of sudden inflation bursts (1973 and 1974) followed by a sudden lowering of price increases (1975) is illustrated even better in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>. The reason is that <i>wage drift is governed by a margin of high-performance firms but spreads to all firms through competition for workers in the labor market</i>. High\u00ad performance firms bid up wages to get more workers to improve their profit position, so arrows above 10% rates of return in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> tend to go up and right. Low\u00ad performance firms have to take these wage increases in order not to lose workers, and their rate-of-return position deteriorates.

The shift is in both dimensions, however, and the fiscal measure enacted both lowers the average growth rate for the industry and increases the rate of return. The reason is again indirectly clear from <a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8 and 9</a>. The two fiscal measures combined shift the composition of demand suddenly.

Among these effects are the seemingly different short - term and long-term responses to a set of parameter changes. Other unfamiliar effects are the economy wide consequences of disturbances in market price signaling transmitted through the responses of firms. Some of the effects mentioned have been suggested as empirically relevant in literature, but to my knowledge this spectrum of features has not yet been brought together witin one explicit model system. Their origin can be traced to the market processes that coordinate economic activities and aggregate them to macro. Hence, they will neither be discovered in, nor understood with the help of economy wide models that lack explicit markets, which refers to most that can be found in literature. The tax experiments reported on in this paper, and the tax wedges that bias price signals in markets have been particularly illustrative in this respect.",

We prefer to work with a production system with capacity expressed as potential output and no explicit aggregate measure of capital stock. The reason is that the estimation procedure is geared to direct use of individual firm data on the format of each firm\u2019s own internal accounting and planning system. There one seldom or never meets with the concept of aggregate capital stock in the context of production planning See <a href=\"#bib12\">Eliasson (1976a)</a>. The mere fact that QFR(L)- as estimated on data from the Planning Survey - shifts by investment of course means that one can define an implicit measure of capital that has accomplished that shift. If we do so, a generalized CES-type production function can be shown to appear (See <a href=\"#bib15\">Eliasson (1978)</a>. The QFR(L) specification combined with its updating by new investment vintages is however perfectly OK for our purposes, since we are neither concerned with modelling observable firm production planning, nor being compatible with neoclassical micro theory.",

The scales of the Swedish income tax system are now indexed. During inflationary times like the 1970s absurd things occur if the scales are not frequently adjusted. This has been done several times since 1970.Inflation is endogenous. These corrections in the model must be entered through e in the above TXI function. We forgot to enter such corrections after 1976 in a 20-year experiment that started in 1968. A gradual slowdown in total economic growth occurred; not extreme, but unexpected, and it led us to look for the reason. We found a rapidly decreasing current, after tax income inflow into the household sector, and a tremendous public budget surplus piling up and being deposited in the money system.(Public employment and expenditures were fixed in volume terms).Household private consumption was still being maintained at high levels but at a diminishing growth rate. Why? Households were simply borrowing back the public surplus at the going interest rate to maintain their living standards. In the current version of the model the only hindrance to borrowing is the upward drift in the interest rate that occurs if total demand for funds grows faster than total supply of funds. Interest costs are fully tax-deductible in the model as well as in Sweden. The slight slowdown in growth in private consumption was dictated by the permanent income or habit formation part of the household expenditure system that determined how fast households reduce their addicted consumption levels, that are in turn determined by past consumption levels. This reduction was strongly dampened by the efficient inflation and income tax hedge that borrowing constitutes in the Swedish tax world, a hedge that is also effectively enjoyed by income earners possessing highly valued and mortgageable property. This property of the entire model economy that we did not foresee, and discovered accidentally, however, is quite in line with the current political discussion of the problems afflicting the Swedish tax system.",

Erratic (\u201crandom\u201d) signals contain no information and cannot be interpreted, and by definition, the more of such noisy price signaling the more disorderly markets. However, if the change to a new tax system is gradual and smooth the more interpretable price signals. We can then isolate the effects due to price disturbances during the transition, from the structural effects of the change in tax system if we run the experiment long enough. We have not done that due to the time constraint, and because we then have to leave the domain of known historical experience (1969-1975) and interpret our results in a new, hypothetical economic environment. That would be a major, but interesting research effort that we will have to leave for another occasion.",
