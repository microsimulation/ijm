This study explores the interdependence between projected savings and labour supply decisions implied by a detailed and empirically validated microsimulation model of UK households. Analysis focusses upon sensitivity of projected effects of two generic policy counterfactuals, to three alternative approaches for projecting savings and employment decisions. The results reveal that a well-specified reduced-form can generate qualitatively similar projections for policy counterfactuals to a structural approach, even if quantitative differences are difficult to avoid. Furthermore, adapting a reduced-form model to accommodate structural employment responses can be expected to obtain a close quantitative approximation to short-run projections in which both employment and savings decisions are based on utility maximisation theory. The same is not true, however, for longer-run projections due to the cumulative influence of state-specific variation.",

One dimension of contemporary development has been the use of increasingly sophisticated methods for projecting micro-unit behaviour. In economic contexts, interest has focussed on introduction into microsimulation models of structural methods for projecting agent decisions, which provide a conceptually coherent basis for exploring the effects of policy counterfactuals. Despite improvements in the analytical tools available to model builders, however, the developmental, analytical, and computational costs of incorporating structural routines for projecting behaviour remain substantial in most realistic policy contexts. Furthermore, the advantages of including such routines are both context specific and <i>a priori</i> uncertain. In presence of clear and substantial developmental costs and opaque advantages, it is perhaps unsurprising that structural methods for projecting behaviour remain the exception rather than the rule for economic microsimulation models in use today. This paper is designed to improve the evidence base for model design, by using a detailed and empirically driven microsimulation model of UK households to explore sensitivity of projected effects of policy counterfactuals to alternative approaches for projecting labour, consumption and investment decisions.",

The advent of economic modelling was made possible by two key developments during the early 1900s (<a href=\"#bib13\">Klein, 2004</a>). First, there was the uptake of mathematical methods by economists, for both statistical evaluation (econometrics; Frisch) and theoretical development (Keynes, Hicks, Marshall, following Jevons, Menger, Walras). Secondly, the economic shocks of the great depression of the 1930s and the Second World War prompted interest in the development of public statistics.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> Modern economic modelling essentially arose from a desire to make use of the newly available data via the then newly developed statistical methods, to understand the determinants of fluctuations in economic activity. Pioneering work in this regard was conducted by Jan Tinbergen, who was credited by Solow as \u201ca major force in the transformation of economics from a discursive discipline into a model-building discipline\u201d (<a href=\"#bib20\">Solow, 2004</a>, p. 159).",

He consequently advocated re-specification of economic models in terms of simulated micro-units, which could be aggregated up to macroeconomic measures. This proposition ushered in something of a golden-age for microsimulation, with intense interest in microsimulation development throughout the 1960s and 1970s.",

This line of enquiry culminated in growing recognition of the limitations of econometric (reduced-form) specifications for forecasting the effects of policy counterfactuals, especially from the mid-1970s (e.g. <a href=\"#bib5\">Conant &amp; Ashby, 1970</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">Lucas, 1976</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">Campbell, 1979</a>, and <a href=\"#bib8\">Goodhart, 1984</a>). The source of the criticism was essentially anticipated by Keynes in his original critique of Tinbergen\u2019s work, when he noted that \u201cthe main <i>prima facie</i> objection to the application of the [econometric] method of multiple correlation to complex economic problems lies in the apparent lack of any adequate degree of uniformity in the environment\u201d (<a href=\"#bib12a\">Keynes, 1939</a>, p. 567).",

This shift in focus led to the development of macroeconomic models based on microeconomic foundations, with the advent of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models from the early 1960s, and Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models from the 1980s.<sup><a href=\"#fn4\">4</a></sup>",

In contrast, the practical difficulties involved in using micro-foundations to project agent behaviour led modelers to adopt stylisations (e.g. representative agents) that effectively side-lined the microsimulation approach. Most developmental work on microsimulation models undertaken since the 1980s has consequently focussed on improving the statistical detail that the models capture, while retaining the traditional econometric (reduced-form) approach for projecting agent decisions. Nevertheless, there has in recent years been a noticeable trend in the microsimulation literature toward the inclusion of structural forms of decision making: In their survey of over 60 dynamic microsimulation models developed over the decade to 2013, for example, <a href=\"#bib13b\">Li and O\u2019Donoghue (2013)</a> identify 16 that use (structural) behavioural equations to project decisions. The authors go on to note that \u201cmore models today have incorporated behavioural responses into their designs although these responses are often limited to labour market simulations\u201d (p. 26). Hence, while models are identified that project labour supply responses to the taxbenefit system (MICROHUS, PRISM, NEDYMAS, LIAM), and others that project retirement responses to the social security system (SESIM, DYNAMITE, SADNAP), the authors conclude that there remains \u201climited implementation of life-cycle models in microsimulation\u201d (p. 26).",

This approach requires computationally demanding Dynamic Programming (DP) methods to solve (e.g. <a href=\"#bib19\">Rust, 2008</a>). In the case of DSGE models, the computational burden has been mitigated by limiting consideration to a small number of representative agents. In contrast, it was not until the 2000s that computing technology became generally available that is sufficiently powerful to permit implementation of DP methods in realistic microsimulation contexts. The last decade has consequently seen a growing literature based on Dynamic Stochastic Microsimulation Models (DSMMs). Much of this literature focusses on econometric evaluation of theoretical foundations, following the seminal study by <a href=\"#bib9\">Gourinchas and Parker (2002)</a>.

Analysis focuses on the two principal behavioural margins of the domestic sector; consumption / savings, and labour / leisure. Basic economic theory suggests that savings and employment decisions are jointly determined: Stronger incentives to save can be met in part through increased labour supply; reduced returns to employment can be met in part through reduced pecuniary savings. These trade-offs are well understood and widely appreciated. Yet their implications in practical policy settings are difficult to gauge, in part because a cursory appraisal reveals them to be context specific, and in part because few models exist that permit empirical evaluation in anything approaching a realistic policy context. As a consequence, there is thin evidence for formulating adequate responses to two key modelling questions. First, generally how important is it to account explicitly for the behavioural trade-offs implied by policy counterfactuals in microsimulation projections? And secondly, to what extent will an explicit consideration of labour supply incentives alone reflect projections in which policy trade-offs concerning both the labour / leisure and consumption / savings margins are explicitly accounted for? The former of these questions addresses the overall importance of accommodating theoretical descriptions for behaviour in a microsimulation context, and the latter indicates the practical importance of analytically convenient modelling assumptions that marginalise dynamic considerations (e.g. savings) when projecting behaviour.",

The two policy counterfactuals are a 10 percentage point increase in the rate of tax on all taxable income, and a 20 percentage point fall in the value of state retirement benefits. These counterfactuals approximate policy changes that are often considered in the literature, either because they are a focus of interest, or because they act as convenient adjustments to ensure budget neutrality of alternative reform scenarios. Savings and labour supply responses to each reform are projected on the alternative assumptions that: i) behaviour does not respond to the influence of policy on incentives; ii) labour supply responds to policy incentives, but saving does not; and iii) both labour supply and saving respond to the incentives of policy. These alternative behavioural assumptions capture the nature of alternatives that are commonly considered in the microsimulation literature, and are explored within a single analytical framework to facilitate comparisons between them.",

In contrast, reduced-form descriptions of behaviour are usually assumed to persist in context of a changing policy environment. This difference in simulation approaches complicates a direct interchange of the respective descriptions for behaviour.",

Suppose that consumption was projected using a functional description based on age, wealth, and private income. The structural approach that is implemented by default in LINDA would adapt the consumption function to reflect the influence on incentives of higher tax rates. This approach consequently accommodates an immediate reaction to the policy change. In contrast, if the reduced-form consumption function was not revised to reflect the income tax rise, and private income remained unchanged, then projected consumption would fail to reflect the higher taxes until budgetary effects fed through to affect household wealth. The result is likely to be a run-away wealth effect, and projections for consumption that bear little resemblance to reality.",

This is typically achieved, within the constraints considered for reduced-forms here, by reflecting relationships between behaviour and explanatory variables that are likely to suffer little distortion by the policy environment. In the above example, this would typically be achieved by describing consumption as a function of disposable, rather than private income. A rise in tax rates would then depress disposable income for any given measure of private income, and thereby have an immediate effect on consumption, independent of any associated implications for wealth. While the magnitude of consumption responses generated under the reduced-form and structural approaches might not be the same, this approach for selecting reduced-form specifications is likely to mitigate the differences between them.",

The figure reported for 2016 is substantively lower than related projections reported by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), which suggest that a 1 percentage point rise of all rates of income tax in the 2016/17 tax year would raise \u00a35.5 billion in additional revenue. The reason for this disparity is that the reduced-form descriptions for behaviour assumed here are explicitly designed to reflect immediate labour supply responses throughout the distribution, in common with the \u2018full\u2019 structural approach for projecting behaviour (discussed below). In contrast, the HMRC projection confines responses to higher-rate tax-payers, assuming that a 1 per cent rise in the marginal tax rate would lead to a 0.45 per cent reduction in taxable income. This disparity consequently reveals the potential sensitivity of reduced-form projections based on heuristically selected descriptions for behaviour.<sup><a href=\"#fn9\">9</a></sup>",

The remaining three panels of the table help to explain this variation by disaggregating the net budgetary effects. These statistics indicate that all three budgetary components contribute to the differences in net government revenue projected for the rise in income tax rates under the full- and non-response scenarios. That is, the higher increases in net government revenues projected under the assumption that both savings and employment respond to policy incentives are coincident with smaller increases in benefits expenditure, larger increases in income tax revenue, and smaller decreases in consumption tax revenue. The most important of these components, by a wide margin, is income tax revenue, followed by consumption taxes; differences in projected benefits account for relatively little of the variation projected for net government revenues.",

Although this result may seem intuitive, it is nevertheless useful to confirm, and provides some support for the prevailing trend to add structural labour supply responses to microsimulation models that include reduced-form descriptions for consumption. It is of further note that the intermediate statistics generated under the employment-response scenario reported in the table tend to be closer to those generated under the full-response scenario in the near-term (within a 10 year horizon), and closer to the non-response scenario in the longer term. It is conceivable that policy makers would find the relative variation generated under the employment-response scenario strictly preferable to either of the two behavioural alternatives reported in the table.

This relationship reverses as the simulated time horizon extends, so that by 2046 the projected increase in net government revenue is \u00a32.9 billion smaller under the full-response scenario. The remaining statistics in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a> indicate that \u00a31.2 billion of this temporal reversal is due to a smaller decline in state expenditure on retirement benefits under the full-response scenario, \u00a31.4 billion is due to a larger fall of income tax revenue, and \u00a31.0 billion is due to a larger decline in consumption tax revenue.

In terms of wage potential, the re-scaling was evaluated by assuming full employment of all adult household members.

While the full-response scenario also projects declines in consumption under the higher tax policy, these declines are smaller than those reported for the non-response scenario. This is partly attributable to the smaller declines projected for disposable income under the full-response scenario. Importantly, however, it also reflects the reduction in savings incentives associated with the higher tax environment, which are not taken into consideration by the reduced-form analysis. These savings responses can also be seen in the wealth effects of the rise in taxes reported in <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a>, which indicate a rise in (tax-shielded) pension wealth, more than off-set by a relative decline in non-pension wealth under the full-response scenario.",

In the current context, for example, the reduced-form projections imply a larger reduction in consumption and employment under the higher tax regime than the structural projections. Lower consumption implies higher future savings, which generally depresses employment, and it is this process that generates the drift of the employment-response scenario toward the non-response scenario over the simulated time horizon. In general, it is not usually known how these behavioural alternatives relate, so that it is impossible to say how a projection that accommodates employment responses to incentives in context of a reduced-form description for consumption/saving might vary, relative to a full structural framework. What is clear, however, is that quantitative distortions associated with a reduced-form description for consumption can generate substantial biases in longer-term employment projections, even if the structural description for employment is well-specified. This is an important observation, given the cursory consideration that is sometimes paid to reduced-form descriptions for consumption when accommodating structural labour-supply decisions.",

All three behavioural scenarios project falls in leisure and consumption throughout the simulated time horizon, as households work and save more to off-set the reduced generosity of state benefits. The associated increases in employment generate higher measures of private income, which are more than off-set by coincident declines in state retirement benefits paid, so that disposable income for population cross-sections is projected to fall in all simulated years and behavioural scenarios. The increased saving among the working aged population appears as a rise in pension wealth in all projections.

The reason for this is that the reduced-form consumption responses to the fall in state retirement benefits tend to exaggerate savings, which depresses labour supply, while the reduced-form employment responses tend to exceed those generated by the structural model.

Of the three population subgroups reported in <a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a>, the middle income quintile displays the most substantive reductions in labour supply under the full-response scenario, and then toward the start of the working lifetime. The relative scale of employment effects reported for the full-response scenario, across both age bands and income quintiles, reflect a balance between the price and wealth effects of the rise in income tax rates, where wealth effects are intensified with the projected decline in wealth holdings.",

This explains why the projected reductions in labour supply for the top quintile do not fall away under the non-response scenario, as discussed above for the full-response scenario. Furthermore, labour effects generated under the employment-response scenario lie between those projected under the non- and full-response scenarios. In this case, results of the employment-response scenario for the middle quintile are substantively closer to those of the full-response scenario, but for the highest quintile tend to be closer to the non-response scenario, reflecting distributional differences in scale of wealth effects. These differences consequently emphasise the crucial bearing of the specification used to identify behaviour using reduced-forms, which is an obvious concern wherever choice of specification is heuristically made with respect to limited objective criteria.",

This is reflected in the close correspondence, across both age and income quintiles, projected for the effects on wealth by the three alternative behavioural scenarios. These results underscore the potential for well-specified reduced-form models to capture the qualitative nature of structural projections, even if differences in scale are almost impossible to avoid.",

All three behavioural scenarios suggest that households above the bottom quintile will tend to off-set the decline in state retirement benefits by increasing labour supply, reducing consumption, and increasing saving during the working lifetime. In contrast, households at the bottom of the distribution, being liquidity constrained, do not increase provisions ahead of retirement, and are projected to suffer relatively large declines in consumption later in life as a result.",

This can be understood as the product of an excessive reflection of the wealth effect of the policy reform in the assumed reduced-form description for behaviour, relative to the fully-structural projection. The implication is that the reduced-form projections generate larger increases in wealth held late in life under both the non- and employment-response scenarios, relative to the full-response scenario. The rise in wealth tends to depress the increase in labour time projected late in life under the employment-response scenario, relative to the non-response scenario. The message running through these results is deceptively simple: A reduced-form structure is capable of capturing responses generated by a structural framework to the extent that the associated incentives are reflected by the assumed reduced-form behavioural specification. Unfortunately, identifying a well-specified reduced-form description for behaviour is a non-trivial task.",

The first of these questions provides a sense of the overall importance of structural behavioural responses when using a microsimulation model to analyse the effects of policy change, and the latter considers the practical importance of analytically convenient assumptions for structural decision making. The analysis focuses upon statistics projected using a common model structure, for the effects of two generic policy counter-factuals, with respect to three alternative sets of behavioural assumptions.",

The first is a scenario in which behaviour is projected on a functional description defined for the base policy context. This scenario is designed to approximate the traditional microsimulation approach of projecting behaviour based on reduced-form statistical descriptions estimated on historical survey data. The second scenario extends upon the first by building in structural responses to policy counterfactuals in relation to labour supply. This second scenario is designed to reflect the extension of structural methods within the contemporary microsimulation literature. Finally, the third behavioural scenario extends structural responses to counterfactual policy contexts, by considering both the labour/leisure and consumption/savings margins, as is common in agent based models, and a growing subset of the microsimulation literature. The structural framework considered for analysis projects behaviour as if it maximises expected lifetime utility, which has been the foundation of (dynamic) economic theory for the last half century.",

These policy counterfactuals are common in the existing literature, either as a focus of stand-alone interest, or as potential policy adjustments to achieve defined budgetary objectives. Furthermore, the features of the two policy counterfactuals are complementary, presenting very different incentive effects, and different influences during the life course.",

Furthermore, extending a well-specified reduced-form model to accommodate structural responses for employment is likely to generate a close quantitative approximation of short-to-medium-term (up to 10 years in the current study) projections derived from a model in which both employment and savings are projected as though to maximise expected lifetime utility. Nevertheless, important quantitative differences are likely to emerge in longer-term projections between models distinguished by whether the consumption/savings margin is structurally simulated. This is because of the difficulty associated with projecting similar quantitative measures for consumption using reduced-form and structural approaches, with any differences accumulating in the projections for household wealth, which in turn distort other margins of decision making (including employment). This is an important observation, given the cursory consideration that is sometimes paid to reduced-form descriptions for consumption when accommodating structural labour-supply decisions.",

It must also be adapted to reflect the bearing of considered policy counterfactuals on incentives. This is a difficult task, particularly where forward-looking expectations are likely to be important. While informal methods might be used to identify pertinent incentives, selecting an empirical specification that will match the implications of a structural framework is non-trivial. In this sense, the results can be interpreted as providing support for the recent research interest in identifying heuristic decision rules, associated with Agent-based economics.",

In contrast, the duties levied on alcohol, tobacco and fuel vary substantially across individual products. Averages were consequently calculated for the rates applied to individual products within these three broad consumption categories, weighting by expenditure share (data supplied by HM Treasury).

Despite the coincident decline projected for disposable incomes in 2016 (due to both the reduction in labour incomes and higher tax burdens), however, projected consumption expenditure remains invariant by construction under the employment-response scenario. This combination of lower disposable incomes and fixed consumption expenditure in near-term projections following the rise in income taxes produces a rapid draw-down of assets under the employment-response scenario. The decline in asset holdings exaggerate the wealth effects of the higher tax rate counterfactual, off-setting incentives to reduce labour supply under the employment-response scenario. This is the mechanism that is responsible for the drift of the projections under the employment-response scenario toward those of the non-response scenario as the time horizon is extended.",
