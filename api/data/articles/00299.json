We simulate a Schumpeterian Creative Destruction process driven by endogenous entrepreneurial entry causing reorganization or exit of firms that acquire and release resources in markets under different institutional conditions. While too fast structural change may make endogenous prices unreliable as conveyors of information, increasing the rate of economic mistakes and slowing econmic growth, an optimal balance between the rate of firm turnover and long run sustainable growth is demonstrated to exist. Optimal growth depends on the balance between entries and exits, the performance and size of new firms compared to incumbents, and on variation in the same characteristics. There is also the general problem associated with selection based, initial state dependent non linear micro based models that the incidence of even minor mistaken investment decisions may cumulate with time into major macro consequences (\"deterministic chaos\"). We conjecture that the negative tilting (as some \"high speed\" market entry simulations close up with the 75 year horizon) of the macroeconomic trajectories depends on the incidence of Type II econmic mistakes, or winners getting lost along the way.",

Much of this Schumpeterian recognition is however only nominal, in that modellers struggle to fit entrepreneurial entry into neoclassical equilibrium models that we consider incompatible with the existence of reasonably defined entrepreneurs. Schumpeter (1911) himself regarded the entrepreneur a disturber of a Walrasian equilibrium. While the MOSES model, that we simulate in this study, can be seen as a general dynamic game of monopolistic competition kept in constant motion by endogenous entrepreneurial entry competition <a href=\"#bib36\">(Eliasson, 1985)</a>, the influential survey article by Franco <a href=\"#bib66\">Modigliani (1958)</a> on new oligopoly theory had had little to say on empetitive entry as a price determining factor, and probably limited the interest in entry among economists for years. When that interest at last arrived, even empirical modellers, unfortunately have considered it mandatory to shoehorn entrepreneurial entry into incompatible equilibrium straitjackets.",

It plays the necessary role of sorting out entrants that the market test has rejected and, in general, to set resources free for expanding firms. Exits of failed businesses therefore become a natural transactions cost for economic development , and an imp0rtant element in Schumpeterian creative destruction (<a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>). In this process of creative destruction (the term first appeared in <a href=\"#bib72\">Schumpeter, 1942</a>) one could, therefore, argue that a faster turnover of firms should reflect a more intense market search for new business opportunities and a reallocation of resources away from firms that have been unsuccessful in identifying and commercializing new business opportunities, to firms that are successful, or more to the point, been unable to cope with competition. Hence, we should expect a positive correlation between the turnover of firms and growth. Empirical support for this is, for instance, provided by <a href=\"#bib21\">Haltiwanger et al. (2004)</a> and <a href=\"#bib52\">Fogel et al. (2006)</a>. However, as the market selection dynamics of the MOSES model will demonstrate below, underlying this proposition is a positive market determined relationship between entrepreneurial entry and exits such that increasing returns to continued search (pushed by entrepreneurial competition) for investment opportunities occurs and successful winners dominate over exiting losers (<a href=\"#bib44\">Eliasson, 2003</a>; ; <a href=\"#bib83\">Eliasson, 1995</a>). While experiments on the MOSES model had already demonstrated that the organization of markets, and notably market flexibility, was instrumental in creating the positive relationship to firm turnover (<a href=\"#bib80\">Eliasson and Taymaz, 2000</a>), this paper conjectures that this positive relationship is nonlinear, and will eventually bend down as an increasing rate of structural change, reflected among other things in fast changes in the population of firms, lowers the reliability of market price signaling and disturbs the market self-coordination functions.",

Firms in MOSES form price expectations in the three markets of the m0del (product, labour and financial) and integrate them in their investment, production and recruitment plans (<a href=\"#bib30\">Eliasson, 1976b</a>). Price expectations , however, normally come out more or less wrong; an instance of Stockholm School ex ante-ex post economics. After market confrontations with other firms, most plans thus come out more or less in error. Two types of mistakes are constanly made. Most commonly mistakes take too long to be identified and corrected (Type I mistakes). Most serious, however, are that winners may be lost, often for good (Type II mistakes, see (<a href=\"#bib81\">Eliasson and Eliasson, 1996</a>).

We hypothesize that the positive growth effects of increased firm turnover dominate up to a limit, then to turn negative as the rate of entry and structural change increases, competition intensifies and the rate of firm turnover tilts towards a dominance of mistaken plans due to a disturbed price signaling in markets, and an increased rate of business failure.

It may also be the case that the negative macro consequences begin to show sufficiently early for agents, including policy makers, to take notice and react to counter these effects. More likely however is that negative consequences take so long to show statistically that their origin cannot be identified, and that corrective measures are both too late and wrong (<a href=\"#bib48\">Eliasson and Taymaz, 1992</a>). To establish the possible theoretical existence of such a long term downside of Schumpeterian Creative Destruction only simulation analysis will do. And MOSES type micro to macro models is the only way of getting some quantitative control of the policy situation. Hence, this analysis becomes a theoretical inquiry into the possible existence of such a negative effect in a controlled experiment. In such a controlled experiment (<a href=\"#bib38\">Eliasson, 1991a</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Eliasson et al., 2004</a>), we expect a situation of chaotic behavior to emerge. Under normal circumstances agents make mistakes and respond to mistakes but the markets of the economic system at large will possess sufficient self-regulating capacities to restore order.

                    "text": "Entry, and even more so exit of firms caused by mistaken decisions, for long was an avoided issue in economic theorizing. Because of the mathematical difficulties of allowing for autonomous micro behavior in neoclassical equilibrium models\u00b4such phenomena were neglected, and even mistakenly regarded as irrelevant. As an empirical phenomenon entry and exit, however, exist, and some economists observed early that economic growth might be affected. Some empirically oriented economists (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acs and Audretsch, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Baldwin and Gorecki, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Baldwin and Gorecki, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Baden-Fuller, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Du Rietz, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Hause and Du Rietz, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Highfield and Smiley, 1987</a>) defied the theoretical problems and launched the needed ad hoc empirical inquiries to learn about the magnitudes involved in firm turnover. Econometric models estimated were also loosely related to mainstream economic theory, and a closer analysis would demonstrate that they normally conflicted with the assumptions of the mainstream equilibrium model. For this reason interest among economists in the growing research on entrepreneurship and new firm formation has not been overwhelming. For a long time conventional wisdom was (e.g., <a href=\"#bib51\">Eriksson, 1984</a>) that \u201cindustry growth comes mainly from existing firms\u201d. Since the MOSES model was solidly based on observation in <a href=\"#bib29\">Eliasson (1976a)</a> it was simply impossible to neglect the empirical facts of entry and exit, and an entrepreneurial entry slot was quietly sneaked in, despite advice to the contrary, in <a href=\"#bib32\">Eliasson (1978a)</a>. In simulation analyses, <a href=\"#bib39\">Eliasson (1991b)</a> and <a href=\"#bib80\">Eliasson and Taymaz (2000)</a> also demonstrated (1) that entry induced by \"above equilibrium profitability\" , and (2) exiting firms that had run out of equity, significantly affected long-run growth, but in complex ways of market interactions. The long time needed for significant effects of new entry to appear at the macro level had been demonstrated already by <a href=\"#bib27\">Du Rietz (1975)</a>. <a href=\"#bib60\">Johansson (2001)</a>, furthermore, showed that new and small firms accounted for all growth in employment in the Swedish IT industry between 1993 and 1998, while the large firms as a group significantly reduced their employment. Entry also \u201cbecame seen as one of the main mechanisms by which long-run equilibrium\u201d is restored (<a href=\"#bib12\">Audretsch and Mata, 1995</a>). There are however theoretical problems associated with trying to understand the economy wide economics of firm entry, or for that matter entrepreneurship, in terms of neoclassical orthodoxy. Already Schumpeter liked to refer to his entrepreneur as a disturber of Walrasian equilibrium. <a href=\"#bib64\">Kirzner (1973</a>) , on his side, proposed that the entrepreneur should be seen as the restorer of equilibrium states. On that the MOSES modeller has to object that if market transactions costs associated with non stochastic business failure is a normal cost of economic development and an important explanatory factor in economy wide market self- coordination, the walrasian equilibrium central to neoclassical orthdoxy will not be compatible with the existence of reasonably defined entrepreneurs and endogenous exit, and should be kept out of models fearturing Schumpeterian entrepreneurial competition and the entry and competitive exit of firms. This theoretical complication arises when Stockholm School ex ante-ex post considerations are allowed into the market micro to macro machinery (<a href=\"#bib34\">Eliasson, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Eliasson, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Eliasson, 1991a</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Eliasson, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Eliasson, 2003</a>).",

Furthermore, there is econometric evidence of rates of entry being dependent on rates of return in the firm and/or in the market entered, but the evidence varies between studies. The reason for the absence of such relationships in some studies might be that entrants are generally overoptimistic and believe their technology to be superior to that of their incumbent competitors in the market and be independent of the situation at large in the market. In reality then, entry depends on expected profitability on the part of the entrant, which is difficult to measure. <a href=\"#bib57\">Highfield and Smiley (1987)</a>, however, believe that the lack of empirical support of this neoclassical relationship in other studies (for instance in the much quoted early <a href=\"#bib68\">Orr, 1974</a>) depends on a \u201c lack of sophistication in modeling entrepreneurs\u00b4 expectations about future profit rates\u201d. It is also hard to believe that there should be no relationship between the aggregate profitability situation in a market and the rate of entry in the same market. Stylized facts, in fact, are that entry increases and exit decreases with profitability and growth in the local markets (<a href=\"#bib73\">Siegfried and Evans, 1994</a>).<a href=\"#fn5\"><sup>5</sup></a>",

This suggests that newly established firms have a higher exit rate than older incumbents, a property empirically supported by <a href=\"#bib10\">Audretsch and Mahmood (1994)</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Audretsch and Mahmood (1995)</a> and <a href=\"#bib25\">Caves (1998)</a> survey of empirical literature. This property and the specification of innovation supply and firm entry are also very similar to <a href=\"#bib62\">Jovanovic (1982)</a> model of passive learning of firms, i.e. firms learn of their own capacities by being subjected to the reality of markets. For some, trained in standard micro production analysis, this may seem counter intuitive, since for them old and obsolete plants should exit first. On this <a href=\"#bib58\">Honjo (2000)</a> finds that new firms have greater difficulties surviving than old firms, notably in markets with high entry rates and (therefore) intense competition. <a href=\"#bib8\">Audretsch (1995a)</a> observes that survival rates (over a decade) are lower in highly innovative than non-innovative markets, but entrants that have survived exhibit higher growth rates than other firms.

The key selection problem of economic growth however is that winning innovations are identified and not lost, and succesfully carried on to industrial scale production and distribution. Market selection is a complex and resource using process, lost winners representing a large social cost in terms of lost output. Competence bloc theory presents the critical actors involved in technology selection, commercialization of innovations and scale up. Otimal market selection performance occurrs when the long term macroeconomic incidence of two kinds of economic mistakes are minimized; keeping losing projects on the books for too long (Type I mistakes) and losing winners (Type II mistakes), type II mistakes being the by far most important. While close to impossible to observe directly, the existence of type II mistakes can however be demonstrated through simulation experiments on the MOSES model, as can also the entire optimization process by designing and testing different market organizations (<a href=\"#bib81\">Eliasson and Eliasson, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Eliasson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Eliasson, 2003</a>).",

Also factors of productions used in exiting firms (labor and machines) are recycled over the market to other firms. In general, we want to relate entry to the Schumpeterian (<a href=\"#bib71\">Schumpeter, 1911</a>) concept of entrepreneurial entry as it apperas in the Creative Destruction Process in Table 1.In reality, however, entry and exit take on more diverse forms. <a href=\"#bib59\">Jenner (1966)</a> wanted to see the launching of a new product as a new entrant, and firms may acquire parts of other firms, or spin-off parts of itself as new entrants. Strategic acquisitions and divestures have become an increasingly important phenomenon in industrial dynamics. Similarly, the shutting down of a factory as well as the termination of a product line in a big firm should count as exit. This is perfectly compatible with our theory as expressed in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>, but such a fine statistical resolution takes us beyond availability of data, even though a few empirical studies have looked at corporate spin-offs (e.g., <a href=\"#bib27\">Du Rietz, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Du Rietz, 1980</a>). The same phenomenon on the exit side is more difficult to define and observe statistically. A complete reorganization of a firm with many subsidiaries, including divestures and new acquisitions should count as a complex entry and exit process, and may to some extent appear in statistics as the disappearance of old, and the opening up of new firm identification numbers. Part of this activity will be possible to test for statistically in econometric models. The MOSES model, as it is currently designed is prepared to deal with the desired realism for complex both theoretical and empirical analysis. Avalability of data , however, sets the ultimate limits to the empirical study on how reorganization of micro structures affect macro (Item 2 in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>), and the practical way to proceed, to our mind, would be to develop statistical methods to feed the MOSES model with case study data.",

This means that the exit rate might be positively correlated with the general profitability in the market because increased entry of superior firms increases competition and forces exit.

This dynamic of market resource reallocation is difficult to demonstrate econometrically, and in particular on the short time series panel data available. It has been demonstrated to be a property of the MOSES model by <a href=\"#bib42\">Eliasson (2000)</a>. The clear result of that study was that a <i>long-term,</i> positive outcome of entry required a significant exit rate and a fast reallocation of labor over the market.

On the entry side, the \u201coptimal\u201d number in the model simulation amounts to some 1.1 percent of the stock of firms per year, which is slightly above the average of just below 1 percent in the 1970s and 1980s in Swedish manufacturing (<a href=\"#bib7\">Andersson et al., 1993</a>).<a href=\"#fn9\"><sup>9</sup></a> We have no corresponding exit data and apparently the exit rate simulated is much lower (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

There is, however, the possibility, indicated earlier, that the strong negative bend on the growth curve at very high rates of entry after 50 years depends on a too low exit rate (unbalanced turnover) and would go away if we speed up the rate of exits by making management more profit conscious. Hence, the extreme bending down in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a> is unlikely to occur in reality because such high entry rates rarely occur for such long periods.

Above some limit the rate of structural change will begin to affect the reliability of price signaling in markets negatively, and raise the incidence of mistaken business decisions.Winners may get lost (Type II mistakes). To test for a long- run, non-linear negative influence of a very fast and (perhaps) unbalanced firm turnover process very long time series data that are not available are needed. <i>Simulation has been the only way of establishing the possible theoretical existence of this phenomenon</i>. It may even be so that the firm turnover rate needed to generate disturbances in the price system has to be so extreme that it \u201ccannot occur\u201d under normal circumstances in reality. If so, the negative relationship will not be observable. The micro-to-macro model of the Swedish economy has been found to embody the expected non-linear characteristics and for the reasons hypothesized. The output growth curve began to bend down after about half a century at entry rates that were far above recorded entry rates during the past 20 years. In that sense the model economy can be characterized as robust in response to price disturbances.",

We can say that the simulation experiments reported on directly perform the transformation of <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a> into macro change, firms being guided in their investment and production decisions by price expectations and a profitability criterion called Maintain or Improve Profits (MIP. See (<a href=\"#bib30\">Eliasson, 1976b</a>) as they compete for income in product markets and for resources in capital and labour markets. Growth occurs if winning projects/firms are opting for investment and growth and losers are contracting or shutting down. This ideal market dynamic may not always be the outcome, however. Long \u2013 term investment decisions in MOSES firms are guided by the expected return to capital over the market interest rate. The MIP criterion accepts that firms are temporarily inferior performers by that rate of return criterion, but force them to constantly improve their performance. Hence, if firms cannot meet their own short-term profit standards they may decide to contract operations rather than invest and expand. In this particular set of experiments unreliable price signaling in markets may lead both to mistaken production and investment decisions and tilt an increasing number of firms onto a lower than possible growth path. Similarly, unbalanced growth, with too few exits may raise factor prices and tilt expansive firms onto lower growth paths.<a href=\"#fn10\"><sup>10</sup></a>",

Sustainability involves an \u201coptimization\u201d over a very long time span. An interesting question is if the policy maker should have a role in that optimization decision. The first problem to resolve, then, is to figure out the reasons for the long-run negative effect of fast turnover on growth. Wouldn\u2019t the economy have developed endogenous market correction mechanisms that eliminate such long-run effects? The negative effects (and <i>first</i>) take a long time in coming. They cannot be discovered ahead of time by analytical methods so there is no opportunity for policy makers to act ahead with precise targeting of counter measures. <i>Second</i>, even if they had known what was coming, policy makers might not understand what to do and easily enact mistaken policies (<a href=\"#bib48\">Eliasson and Taymaz, 1992</a>). <i>Third</i>, part of the difficulties of understanding the social and econmic costs of disturbed markets has to do with the incidence of lost winners (Type II mistakes) that may even permanently hold back economic development (see <a href=\"#bib19\">Ballot and Taymaz, 1998</a> on the incidence of technlogical lock-ins in the MOSES economy). <i>Fourth</i>, however, the low entry rates per year should be seen in relation to the total firm population. The model firm population features much less heterogeneity than the real firm population. Hence, the model economy is not as robust as the real economy and the downward bending of the curve should occur at a lower entry rate than in reality. Accounting for that one might perhaps say that the large entry rates to the right in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, involving a very large increase in the firm population, are not sustainable for an entire economy for such a long period, only locally and then the realistic range of entry over a long period would be just above or just below the optimum, but not so far off. Then negative effects may go undiscovered for decades. In conclusion one might at least take note of the fact that this observation from model experiments is in line with Swedish experience over the last 80 years: a steady lowering of new firm formation per year from a peak around 3 percent in the 1920s to a low around 0.5 percent in the 1990s (<a href=\"#bib7\">Andersson et al., 1993</a>). As a consequence industrial structures increasingly became dominated by a group of incumbent large firms, several of which ran into trouble during the oil crises years of the 1970:s. To prevent a large scale destruction of obsolete firms and a negative immediate employment effect the exit process of the real economy was slowed by an extreme subsidizing program. This subsidy program and alternative disbursements of public money under the same budget constraint has been reenacted on the (real) firms in the model, mostly the shipyards. Sweden at that time was the second largest shipbuilding nation of the world supplying almost 10 percent of output. Today none of these shipyards exists, The creative destruction had been artificially slowed by industrial policy interference, which was socially very costly in terms of lost output, all being estimated in an economy wide cost benefit study on MOSES <a href=\"#bib24\">Carlsson (1983)</a>. Since all receipients of industrial subsidies were represented in the data base of MOSES subsidies could be allocated on the now dead firms exactly by amount and time received. Those firms in fact only survived in the model simulation (as well as in reality) only as long as the subsidies were doled out. If the money was taken away, and redistributed equally on all firms through a lowering of the payroll tax, the crisis firms all exited and the economy soon recovered to grow on the earlier faster trajectory, albeit at a lower level. So government had been adding worse to bad by subsidizing the worst performers that were also paying the highest wages (steel and shipyards; <a href=\"#bib24\">Carlsson, 1983</a>) in Sweedish manufacturing. The negative impact on the real Swedish economy of the extreme subsidy program began to be fully observable and understood only as late as the early 1990s. and the MOSES simulations were instrumental in making that collossal policy mistake statistically visible.",
