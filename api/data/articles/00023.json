These so-called CGE-MS models enjoy a growing interest because they build a bridge between macro- and microeconomic analyses. This paper focuses on the \u2018top-down\u2019 approach. In this context, the CGE model is used to simulate the changes at the macroeconomic level after the policy change, which are then passed on to the MS model. The aim of this paper is to compare the \u2018top-down\u2019 approach introduced by Bourguignon <i>et al</i>. (2003) based on a behavioural MS model with an alternative and simpler approach making use of a non-behavioural MS model in combination with a reweighting procedure. Both approaches are presented and applications are provided using South African data. We compare the results obtained with both approaches for a typical simulation of the impact of trade liberalisation on income distribution. The reweighting approach introduces a small bias in the results, however without modifying the main conclusions. This is an indication that, given its relative simplicity compared to the behavioural approach, the reweighting approach can constitute a good alternative when data or time constraints do not allow the use of the behavioural approach and when the interest does not lie in the production of individual-level transition matrices.",

Several approaches have been proposed. The MS model can be integrated into the CGE model by increasing the number of representative households (see <a href=\"#bib10\">Decaluw\u00e9 <i>et al</i>., 1999</a> &amp; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cogneau and Robilliard, 2000</a>).

In the behavioural approach, this is achieved by passing the macroeconomic changes on to a behavioural MS model.

Therefore, non-behavioural models are generally less complex and easier to develop. Rather than on behavioural responses, the emphasis of these models is on reproducing the tax and transfer systems in a very detailed manner so that they provide a comprehensive picture of the transition from gross to net income at the household level. <a href=\"#bib19\">Meagher (1993)</a> was among the first to link such a non-behavioural MS model to a CGE model. More recent applications include <a href=\"#bib11\">Devarajan and Go (2001)</a> and <a href=\"#bib1\">Ag\u00e9nor <i>et al</i>. (2002)</a>. This approach was recently refined to allow the MS model to reproduce changes in employment and unemployment as estimated by the CGE model since these aspects are often found to be crucial factors regarding income distribution. <a href=\"#bib13\">Ferreira and Horridge (2006)</a> present an application to Brazil in a static framework while <a href=\"#bib3\">Buddelmeyer <i>et al</i>. (2008)</a> provide an application to Australia in a dynamic framework. In both papers, the CGE employment and unemployment changes are passed on to a non-behavioural MS model by adjusting the sample weights. The procedure relies on adjusting the household weights in the household survey(s) so that jobs are reallocated within the population following the changes estimated by the CGE model. In particular, this procedure can be used to account for changes in employment by gender, skill level, sector, region, occupation or potentially by any variable that is available in both models. These dimensions can be combined together or considered separately. For instance, <a href=\"#bib13\">Ferreira and Horridge (2006)</a> consider a combination of 27 regions, 42 industries and 10 occupations. <a href=\"#bib3\">Buddelmeyer <i>et al</i>.

Unemployed moving into employment are then assigned the average wage for their occupation and a random sector consistent with sectoral employment changes by region and occupation estimated by the CGE model. In the case of a decrease in employment, all workers in the affected sector, region and occupation are affected. These workers\u2019 records are split in two.

In the second stage, the changes in these variables are passed on to the MS model. With regard to prices and capital returns, the procedure is relatively straightforward, because these variables are exogenous to the MS model. The changes in commodity prices and capital returns computed by the CGE model are simply passed on to the MS model. The new prices are used to compute a household-specific consumer price index while all capital incomes are updated using the average change estimated by the CGE model. Likewise, the variations in average earnings by skill level determined by the CGE model are used to update predicted earnings of all working-age individuals with the corresponding skill level in the MS model.

This utility function is estimated separately for four demographic groups: single women, partnered women, single men and partnered men. Therefore, the model explicitly accounts for the heterogeneity of behavioural responses across demographic groups. The addition of a random utility term makes the model probabilistic.

(<a href=\"#bib9\">2002</a>:144), this means that the model \u201cdoes not identify a particular (\u2026) [labour market choice] for each individual after the policy change, but generates a probability distribution over the (\u2026) [labour market choices] used\u201d. This probability distribution is conditional on the observed category corresponding to the optimal choice before the policy change.",

The design of these constraints implies that the MS model determines which individuals, among the entire working-age population, will fill the need for more formal workers if the total number increases according to the CGE model. Similarly, if the number of formal workers decreases, the MS model will search for the individuals with the highest estimated probability of losing their job, among all formal workers.<a href=\"#fn8\"><sup>8</sup></a>",

Indeed, only the macro outcomes concerning the formal sector, which accounts for 70 per cent of paid workers, are imposed on the MS model. As a result, the number of people in the four other sectors (inactive, unemployed, subsistence agriculture and informal sector) is entirely determined by the MS model as a function of individual characteristics and as a function of the required changes in formal employment. In other words, the extent of mobility across sectors is freely determined by the MS model at the individual level without macro-constraints. The degree of mobility of each individual is determined by the MS model depending on individual and household characteristics. If someone is likely to move from one sector to another, this will be represented by very similar values in the utilities associated with both sectors, so that a minor change in predicted earnings could imply a change in labour market choices (especially because earnings are an important determinant of sector choice).",

A calibration process produces new weights, which achieve specified population totals for selected variables, subject to the constraint that there are minimal adjustments to the original weights. It comes down to solving a system of equations with the same number of equations as there are constraints and where the number of endogenous variables is equal to the number of households in the MS model. In the South African model, the reweighting procedure is designed to reproduce formal employment changes from the CGE model by skill level and for 18 industries. Additional constraints are imposed to ensure that the main demographic characteristics of the population remain unchanged. These demographic characteristics include the racial composition of the population as well as the age structure by gender. Four racial groups (i.e. blacks, coloureds, Asians and whites) and 14 age groups are considered. In total, the reweighting is subject to 121 constraints. Following any change in employment, the reweighting procedure ensures that this change is reflected in the new sample weights while ensuring that the composition of the population by age, gender and race remains unchanged.<a href=\"#fn9\"><sup>9</sup></a>",

In the reweighting approach, some \u2018weight\u2019 taken away from the rest of the population is used to increase the sample weights of formal workers in order to reflect the increase in formal employment estimated by the CGE model. The detailed patterns of these weight transfers are unknown but <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a> presents the final result.

In the reweighting approach, it leads to a larger decline in the number of informal workers and subsistence agricultural farmers but to a smaller decrease in the number of unemployed than under the behavioural approach. This can be seen as a bias introduced by the reweighting approach because unlike the behavioural approach it does not seek to control explicitly and comprehensively for the individual characteristics of the new formal workers. For example, the selection model, on which the behavioural approach is based, clearly shows that subsistence agricultural farmers are very unlikely to become formal workers essentially because they live in remote areas and do not have the qualification and education required to work in this sector. By contrast, the model shows that the unemployed are much better candidates for these jobs. These factors are largely ignored in the reweighting approach. Indeed, the only criteria that matter in this approach are the ones explicitly controlled for in the reweighting procedure. In this application, it is race, gender, age and skill. This means that when the reweighting procedure increases the sample weight of, for example, a 29-year-old high-skilled white man working in the formal sector, it will seek to decrease the sample weight of another 29-year-old high-skilled white man (not working in the formal sector) by the same amount (in order to keep the population size and composition constant). In this process, all other individual and household characteristics are ignored.<a href=\"#fn12\"><sup>12</sup></a> Likewise, additional results not shown here indicate that the reweighting approach tends to overestimate the number of partnered men among the new formal workers compared to the behavioural approach. Indeed, the behavioural results show that partnered men are underrepresented among new formal workers, compared to their initial share in formal employment. This result was somewhat expected given that already more than two thirds of the partnered men were formal workers at the time of the household survey.",

However, poverty affects almost only blacks. They represent about 80 per cent of the population but they account for more than 95 per cent of all poor and more than 35 per cent of all blacks are poor. In contrast, poverty is virtually non-existent amongst Asians and whites despite the relatively high incidence of poverty at the national level. Moreover, the Poverty Gap Index<a href=\"#fn13\"><sup>13</sup></a> values indicate that poor blacks are much more deeply in poverty than poor people from other racial groups.

In the application carried out in this paper, trade liberalisation appears less pro-poor under the reweighting approach as the result of this bias in labour market changes.
