A two stage process is proposed where individuals\u2019 preferred choice of leisure and consumption is solved in the first stage, and the second stage identifies the tax/benefit system that maximizes the social welfare function. The study deviates from the mainstream literature as the first stage is based on a micro simulation model with estimated behavioural responses. We estimate a structural model for a sample of workers or voluntary non-workers that describes heterogeneity in consumption-leisure preferences for different household types. Models that describe the participation decision for the unemployed as well as individuals outside the labour force are also included. The results suggest that increased housing allowance, basic deduction, and in-work tax credit in combination with a reduction of the progressive national taxes would increase welfare.",

A labour supply model was used in order to identify the tax rule that maximizes a social welfare function given that the households maximize their own utility under the constraints of constant tax revenue. The present paper focuses on the Swedish income tax/benefit system and extends the Aaberge and Colombino study in several dimensions<a href=\"#fn1\"><sup>1</sup>.</a> First, individuals outside the labour force are also included in the analysis. Individuals classified as unemployed, on disability, long-term sickness, as well as old age pension are included and transitions between non-work states and work states are considered. To include the extensive margin in the analysis is of particular importance when including effects of in-work tax credit reforms, which has become a popular trend in many OECD countries (see <a href=\"#bib21\">Owens, 2005</a>). Secondly, apart from changes in taxes this study also evaluates effects of changes in transfer systems such as housing and child allowances. An important component in the analyses is the combination of tax/benefit systems considered. Thirdly, in contrast to Aaberge and Colombino, who used a parameterization of a piecewise-linear tax system, our approach is to choose among politically feasible tax/benefit systems. The tax and benefit rules in 2006 are regarded as a reference, and then a number of modifications are considered, such as changes in levels, brackets and tax credits/deductions and types of benefits. Finally, inspired by the optimal tax literature, we also evaluate taxes that are age dependent as well as one variant where the marginal tax rate is set to zero at the highest income. Of all these tax/benefit packages, we identify the system that maximizes a social welfare function.",

The microsimulation method permits an exact description of the tax/benefit system, allows for a detailed specification of the labour supply model including both observed and unobserved heterogeneity, and also considers the simultaneous decisions of household members. The micro-approach allows for distributional analysis as well as aggregated measures. As in the theory of optimal taxation, the goal is to search for a system of taxation that minimizes the welfare cost. This is accomplished by using a two stage process where individuals\u2019 preferred choice of leisure and consumption is solved in the first stage and the second stage identifies the tax/benefit system that maximizes the social welfare function.",

One reference is <a href=\"#bib23\">Saez (2001)</a>, where the classical theorems are formulated in terms of supply elasticities, which creates a link between theory and empirical application. In <a href=\"#bib24\">Saez (2002)</a>, an optimal tax design is derived based on supply elasticities at both the intensive and extensive margin. Similar to our study, the one by <a href=\"#bib16\">Immervol <i>et al</i>. (2007)</a> is based on a microsimulation model (EUROMOD) that covers a large number of countries in the European Union. According to their findings, given reasonable welfare weights, the in-work tax credit is an optimal design for most countries. <a href=\"#bib6\">Blundell and Shephard (2011)</a> and <a href=\"#bib8\">Brewer, Saez, and Shephard (2009)</a> give an interesting illustration of the state of the art in optimal taxation. Blundell and Shephard\u2019s approach is based on estimated labour supply models (similar to the models used in this paper), and they include both the intensive and extensive margin (as we do). However, in contrast to our study, they use a simplified tax/benefit system and focus only on the design of earned income tax credits for a sample of lone mothers. Brewer, Saez, and Shephard use a detailed microsimulation model of the UK tax and benefit system. For high-income earners, they use data since the late 1970s and exploit past changes to taxes and benefits as a way to identify the taxable income elasticities. At other points of the income distribution and also for the participation decision, estimated elasticities from the literature are utilized. These elasticities are then used following the work by <a href=\"#bib23\">Saez (2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib24\">2002</a>) to define the optimal shape of the tax and benefit system. Finally the microsimulation model is used again to suggest various changes to the tax and benefit system.",

The estimated elasticities are estimated based on the same data that is used in the simulation, the labour supply models allow for unobserved heterogeneity and also consider the joint decisions of both spouses. Furthermore, in contrast to <a href=\"#bib24\">Saez (2002)</a> our simulations are not based on an income elasticity equal to zero. For further arguments in favour of the computational approach see Aaberge and Colombino. However, even if the methods used in this paper represent a more realistic approach much of the critique expressed in <a href=\"#bib25\">Slemrod (1990)</a> is still relevant. For example administrative costs, simplicity, transparency, tax planning and avoidance and other factors that play an important role in the design of a tax system are not considered.",

For a recent survey of the microsimulation literature see, e.g. <a href=\"#bib7\">Bourguignon and Spadaro (2006)</a>. Static models are used to calculate the immediate impact of institutional changes in the tax and benefit system. They can either be specified as models allowing for behavioural changes, often changes in labour supply, or models that ignore these changes (arithmetic models). FASIT is an example of an arithmetic tax-benefit model developed by Statistics Sweden and used by the Swedish Ministry of Finance. EUROMOD is an extension of these models applicable to the EU countries<a href=\"#fn3\"><sup>3</sup></a>. In principle, these models are only a detailed description of the tax and benefit system, but behavioral effects can be integrated. <a href=\"#bib16\">Immervoll <i>et al</i>.

The argument in favour of this sequential approach is mainly simplicity but also flexibility since it allows for a separate model for each group. The results regarding the order of the sequence are quite robust. The reason is that most of these group are small (see footnote 5) and therefore the risk that an individual that is predicted in one state would be predicted in another state if the sequence was changed is small. Also, even if the change in sequence had an effect on the number of individuals in different states this would still not have a large impact on disposable income since the benefit levels for most non-work states are similar.",

The population at risk (individuals included in the predictions) comprises individuals aged 18\u201364 (but not older children living with their parents) classified as disabled/unemployed, Long-term sick, or working. For couples, at least one of the spouses must belong to the population at risk. For each individual in this population, the tax/benefit module is called upon to calculate disposable income assuming that everyone is classified as being on full-time disability. Next, for the same individuals, income is calculated assuming full-time work (H=1,800). The ratio of disposable income from disability to disposable income from work defines the replacement rate. For instance, a replacement rate of 0.7 means that an individual who receives full-time compensation from disability insurance receives 70 percent of the disposable income as he/she would have as a full-time worker. A change in a tax/benefit that affects the replacement rate will also affect the probability of entry, staying in, or exiting from disability.",

If the simulated probability is less than a random draw from a uniform (0\u20131) distribution, then the event takes place; that is, the individual is classified as disabled. Individuals not classified as disabled get the temporary status (10) and enter the next stochastic model in the sequence. Note that the random errors for each individual are the same before and after a reform. The Monte Carlo experiment acknowledges the fact that even individuals whose characteristics are such that the likelihood of disability is very low still face the risk of \u201cbad luck.\u201d With appropriate changes, the same argument also applies to an individual with a high systematic probability of disability.

After this follows the long-term sick module. The population at risk now comprises those who are long-term sick, those who are working, and individuals in the temporary state. Again the same procedure, and as a result of this module, individuals are classified as long-term sick or temporary. The final binary model concerns old-age pension. The population at risk consists of old-age pensioners, other, working, and temporary status aged 61\u201370. An individual below 61 is not eligible for old-age pension and all individuals older than 70 are by default classified as old-age pensioners.

From 1991, the income tax system has undergone several changes but has still kept much of its basic post-reform structure. However, an important change was made in 2007, when an in-work tax credit was introduced. The tax credit was reinforced during 2008 and further in 2009 when also the national (central governmental) tax was lowered.",

Today, a low- and medium-income earner pays an income tax similar to the average overall OECD level (<a href=\"#bib19\">OECD, 2007</a>). The municipal and national taxes, as a share of earnings, have decreased by almost 10 percentage points since 1980. Despite the income tax cuts, the tax ratio, measured as total taxes in relation to GNP, is still among the very highest in the OECD area. However, when comparing tax ratios one should bear in mind that transfer incomes like pensions and sickness benefits are regarded as taxable incomes in Sweden. Lower taxes on earnings and a relatively stable tax ratio imply large changes in the tax mix. From an OECD perspective, Sweden is more dependent on income taxes and payroll fees and less on consumption taxes compared to an average OECD country.",

The individual is the taxation-unit and income taxes are independent of marital status. The flat municipal tax rate varies across municipalities; in 2006 it ranged from 28.89 to 34.24 percent with an average of 31.55 percent. The marginal taxes have an irregular shape up to SEK 320,000, the first breaking point for national tax. This shape is explained by the phase-in and phase-out of a basic tax deduction. The national tax rate is 20 percent from the first breaking point up to the second at SEK 470,000 and 25 percent above that. The distribution of gross (taxable) income shows that most individuals face a marginal tax rate close to the municipal tax rate, and about 22 percent reach the first breaking point for national taxes and only about 7 percent pay the highest rate.",

However, in real life many different designs have been implemented, sometimes with a uniform tax rate for business and personal income and other times with a lower tax-free allowance for personal income. Even if a flat tax is discussed in the current public debate, it does not seem to be part of the current debate within the OECD area. Instead a progressive system combined with an in-work tax credit seems to be the norm; see <a href=\"#bib17\">Messere, Kam, and Heady (2006)</a>.",

Here, simplicity should not be regarded in the myopic sense of just producing simple rules for income taxation, but rather in a general sense. A flat tax on labour income at a rate harmonizing with the capital levy would help reduce the classical conflict in a dual income tax system caused by different tax rates for capital and labour. This raises an important shortcoming of income taxation studies: the question of optimal taxation should be generalized to the whole tax system and not only taxation of labour, i.e., the whole tax mix should be included in the analyses. However, this would obviously require an extremely complicated simulation model. It is at any rate important to realize that a flat tax has several potential advantages that are not credited in this study, e.g., the possibility to reduce the incentive to move income to the source with the lowest taxation and desirable long-run effects on economic growth. As mentioned above in the evaluation of the flat tax, budget neutrality is not imposed and instead the evaluation focuses on other dimensions than welfare.

As follows from <a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a>, a 20 percent flat tax rate has a strong positive effect on working hours (almost 5%) and therefore also on disposable income (more than 17 percent). Even if labour income increases by almost 5 percent, this is not enough to compensate for reduced taxes (a drop of more than 30 percent). Of course, it can be argued that a tax rate of 20 percent is not a realistic alternative, but as a contrast a 30 percent tax is budget neutral and a 25 percent tax entails a budget deficit of less than 5 percent. Since all comparisons are made according to the rules in 2006, i.e., before the introduction of the in-work tax credit, the budget deficit would be much smaller if comparing with the 2009 budget when the in-work tax credit was implemented. Using <i>SWEtaxben</i> for the comparison of a flat tax and the 2009 tax year shows that a 25 percent flat tax is almost budget neutral (not shown in <a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a>), a result that confirms earlier findings; see Lundgren <i>et al</i>.

One explanation to the modest increase in the inequality of income is the increase in participation. A low flat tax decreases the replacement rate and increases the probability of participation, and, in contrast to an in-work tax credit, the flat tax also increases working hours for median- and high-income earners.",

As expected, the lowest scale factor results in a large budget deficit, but it also has the largest increase in working hours of all reforms evaluated in this study. Number of working hours increases by almost 4 percent and participation by more than 1 percent. Obviously, this results in a dramatic increase of labour income. Despite these strong behavioural effects, there is a large decrease in tax revenues, but (due to behavioural effects) the central government\u2019s budget deficit is much smaller (6.6 %) due to lower social expenditures and increased revenues from payroll taxes and VAT. A purely age-based tax affects the income distribution \u2013 the Gini coefficient increases by about 7 percent. Increasing the phase-in and phase-out constant reduces disposable income but also increases tax revenues.",

If this tax rate were changed to zero, the highest-ability person might choose to work more, which increases his welfare. However, the tax revenue would not change, because before the tax change this labour is not provided, and with a zero tax rate, the extra labour supply is not taxed. This argument applies only to incomes above the highest observable, since changes in marginal tax rates below this level affect the taxes paid by people with higher incomes. Unfortunately, this result does not give any information about the marginal tax level just below the top of the income distribution.",

At low tax levels, both the flat and age-dependent designs have strong labour supply effects. A low tax at the start and at the end of the working life creates incentives for both the entry and exit decision. The simple inverted V tax using a one percent phase-in/phase-out factor implies increased labour supply of almost four percent; however the predicted budget deficit is almost 7 percent. A flat tax of 23 percent produces almost the same budget deficit but has slightly larger labour supply effects. Comparing the budget neutral rates gives a 1.85 percent phase-in/phase-out factor for the age dependent design compared to 29 percent for the flat tax. The disadvantage of both designs is an increased income inequality, although for the age dependent tax this increase is slightly smaller. However, as already mentioned budget neutrality is not imposed.",

As explained in <a href=\"#s4\">Section 4</a>, budget neutrality is obtained by adjusting the (proportional) municipal tax rate, and at this neutral tax the welfare measures have been calculated. The main reason for imposing neutrality is to evaluate reforms using the welfare measures. However, the welfare measures are not the only criteria that can be used to assess tax/benefit reforms. One alternative measure is working hours, implying that the reform that maximizes hours is the preferred one, and another is to choose the reform that minimizes the income inequality. Evaluating the reforms using working hours or income inequality as key criteria does not necessarily require budget neutrality. Many realistic reforms have been introduced without maintaining neutrality within a tax base; instead neutrality is accomplished across tax bases, by base broadening. In the evaluation below, we first present the results based on the welfare measures and then we also comments on working hours and income distribution<a href=\"#fn16\"><sup>16</sup></a>.",

For instance, the reform that gives the highest average welfare, reform 39, gives a relatively low welfare in terms of W1 (rank 17). Note that the reform number is only a label that is used to identify different reforms. The characteristics of reform 39 are: the highest national tax is unchanged (0%), the level of the national tax is reduced (\u2212 25%), the first breaking point is increased (25%), the housing allowance is increased (50%), and there is an age-dependent in-work tax credit. The differences in the reforms that are ranked immediately below are small.

This reform is characterized by an abolition of the highest national tax (\u2212 100%), a reduced national tax level (\u2212 25%), an increased breaking point (25%), an increased housing allowance (50%), and a 100% increase of the 2009 in-work tax credit and basic deduction. This points to the importance of the deduction/credit to get a more even welfare distribution. For instance, if the focus is on W<sub>1</sub>, then all ten reforms with the highest welfare have a doubled deduction/credit. A further examination of these ten reforms shows that they imply the largest increase in working hours, both at the intensive and extensive margin, and also, according to the Gini measure and the D9/D2 ratio, a reduced income inequality.

Based on W<sub>\u221e</sub> as a contrast, the reforms with the highest welfare exhibit unchanged deduction/credit levels, but an age-dependent in-work tax credit. The level of the basic deduction and in-work tax credit has a large importance for the level and distribution of welfare, but when it comes to distributional effects also the housing allowance is of importance.

This reform is associated with a 2.35 percent increase in participation and a 3.52 percent increase in working hours.

If the 2009 reform is modified with an age-dependent in-work tax credit, i.e., combination 14, the ranking increases to 22, and if an increased housing allowance is added, i.e., combination 19, the ranking improves further to the fifth place. It should be mentioned that the 2009 reform includes an increased in-work tax credit for older individuals, but this is far from enough to generate a high welfare ranking. A critique against our evaluation is that the 2009 reform was not designed to be budget neutral. Thus, one explanation to the low ranking of the reform designed similar to the 2009 reform is the lack of an increased basic deduction.",

This produces a profile that is much more like the 2009 design, but compared to 2009 the alternative design benefits low-income earners due to the higher basic deduction, while at the same time high-income earners benefit from a lower marginal tax rate. The lower increase in the credit/deduction also benefits median-income earners due to a lower compensatory tax increase. The increased basic deduction gives a lower average tax rate for both low and median incomes.",

The importance of income inequality in the evaluation of welfare is illustrated by comparing two benefits such as child and housing allowance. An increased housing allowance, targeting low-income households, has a much larger effect on welfare than an increased child allowance. The importance of reduced marginal effective tax rates follows from the observation that a decreased national tax is a common feature of the tax designs with highest welfare. Even dropping the highest national tax can be defended based on the welfare argument. The importance of the in-work tax credit deserves to be mentioned for its double merits: reduced replacement rates lead to increased employment, which reduces the income inequality.",

Social welfare is increased if pensioners as well as individuals on sickness disability and the unemployed receive a higher basic deduction. There are no arguments for increasing the child allowance since it does not target low-income families. The housing allowance should be increased since it targets households with low welfare and also comes at a low budgetary expense.

However, it should be remembered that the estimated parameters that are included in the models for labour supply and participation are affected by the labour market conditions during the period of estimation.

Modelling mobility between studies and work and the importance of economic incentives in this process is complicated, and it is not obvious how to do this in static models. Including older children in the analyses requires household models with more than two adults, and we are not aware of any such study. At the same time, it should be mentioned that our analysis has an unusually broad coverage, the whole population is included and most individuals aged between 16 and 70 are allowed to change their labour supply. A related problem is that we only consider different working states on a full-year basis, i.e., disability whole year, unemployed whole year, etc. Thus, a rather large change in the replacement rate is required in order to change between different full time statuses. In principle it is possible to develop a future version of the model that can handle part-time status and presumably also students and older children. However, the fact that this is not part of the current model is an argument against overestimation of the impact of economic incentives.",
