                "text": "This paper presents a non-parametric microsimulation methodology for assessing the impact of labour market changes and government transfers on income inequality and poverty at the household level. The approach assumes that labour markets are segmented and determines (as part of a randomized process) which individuals are expected to move in or out of employment and which move from one employment segment to another based on either known or counterfactual information of aggregate labour market changes. The methodology assumes that the distribution of earnings of those who become employed in a particular segment resembles that of the individuals observed to be employed in that segment. The approach can be effectively combined in top-down fashion with static or dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, which typically provide insufficient information about household income distribution. The paper discusses the virtues and limitations of applying this methodology and further explains to practitioners how to implement it as a stand-alone methodology or in combination with a CGE model. It also shows how the methodology can be generalized to also capture the poverty and inequality effects of changes in non-labour incomes, such as government transfers. One great advantage of this method is that it is not very demanding in terms of modelling labour supply and household behaviour as compared with alternative parametric approaches, while at the same time providing a plausible link between changes in overall labour market conditions and the full household income distribution.",

                    "text": "The empirical literature on income distribution is extensive and rather fragmented. Much focuses on the outcomes of the labour market processes, since these appear to be a crucial determinant of earnings and income inequality. The development of counterfactual microsimulations methods to study the determinants of distributional changes owes much to the seminal work by <a href=\"#bib14\">Mincer (1958)</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">Oaxaca (1973)</a> and <a href=\"#bib4\">Blinder (1973)</a> who focused on the determinants of differentials in wage earnings. These methods are rooted in human capital theory. They are designed to analyze how the income distribution changes depending on the characteristics of individual workers (such as their working experience or level of education), but are less useful in assessing the impact of changes in aggregate labour market conditions (such as the level of unemployment, sectoral labour demand and wages) as further information is required about which workers are most likely to shift position in the labour market in response to changed conditions.",

One such approach consists of an econometrically estimated household income generation model, as proposed by Bourguignon and others (see <i>e.g</i>., <a href=\"#bib5\">Bourguignon, <i>et al</i>., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2002a</a>,<a href=\"#bib7\">b</a>). The probabilities and determinants of the model subsequently are used to simulate the impact of changes in labour market conditions, endowments of human capital and returns to these endowments on inequality and poverty at the household level. An alternative counterfactual microsimulation methodology, developed originally by <a href=\"#bib1\">Almeida dos Reis and Paes de Barros (1991)</a>, does not explicitly model labour market behaviour, but assumes instead that the way in which shifts in overall labour market conditions (like changes in unemployment, sectoral labour demand or wages) affect occupational conditions of individual workers can be proxied by a random selection procedure in a segmented labour market. This method can be called non-parametric or non-behavioural, because it does not involve econometrically estimated probabilities of the underlying behaviour.",

Such models typically only provide outcomes for employment and wages by rather aggregate labour categories and household groups, though. As a consequence, these models provide too little information about distributional changes to derive robust estimates of the impact of simulated shocks and policies on poverty and income distribution at the household level. This limitation can be overcome by combining the CGE analysis with the type of microsimulation methodologies as just described. Bourguignon <i>et al</i>., (<a href=\"#bib6\">2002a</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">b</a>) first probed this macro-micro modelling using the parametric or behavioural approach for the case of Indonesia. The use of the non-parametric microsimulation approach in conjunction with CGE model analysis, in turn, was pioneered in a number of Latin American studies and later applied more widely (see <a href=\"#bib11\">Vos <i>et al</i>., 2002</a>).",

The main advantage of the non-parametric microsimulation methodology is that it resolves the \u2018assignment\u2019 problem in the labour market while requiring little actual modelling effort in contrast to alternative parametric approaches. One of its weaknesses is that a certain sequence must be assumed in how different dimensions of aggregate labour market changes (<i>e.g</i>. changes in unemployment rates, sectoral labour demand, etc.) impact on the situation of individual workers and their families and this could create a problem of path dependence. As argued in this paper, such path dependence may also affect alternative approaches, but more importantly, it need not be a major concern once one can justify the logic of the followed sequence on the basis of plausible labour market behaviour and as long as the size of certain shifts are not very large.",

In a parametric approach, such as that proposed by Bourguignon and others, for instance, one would model the probability of an individual worker being employed or not, being in a particular occupation and sector of activity and earning a labour income corresponding to the worker\u2019s occupation. Those probabilities then can be used to simulate the likelihood of a worker to change position in the labour market when overall conditions change.",

In essence, this is also the approach applied by Bourguignon and others, in the development of their microsimulations approach. This approach to modelling labour market behaviour had been criticized, however, for overemphasizing labour supply factors and inadequately considering the demand side of the labour market (see <i>e.g</i>. <a href=\"#bib12\">Hartog, 1985</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">1986</a>). Alternative models acknowledge that there is an \u2018assignment problem\u2019 in the economy (see <i>e.g</i>. <a href=\"#bib23\">Sattinger, 1993</a>). These labour market models consider that the distribution of earnings cannot be explained by merely considering characteristics of <i>individuals</i>, but that the characteristics of <i>jobs</i> also need to be taken into account. Assignment models, which consider individual and job characteristics, assume that selection in labour market positioning is the result of voluntary choices by individual workers. Models of labour market segmentation, in contrast, assume the selection is involuntary (see the overview of theories in <a href=\"#bib2\">Atkinson &amp; Bourguignon, 2000</a>: 23). This approach goes to another extreme by assuming that access to some segments of the labour market is restricted. It is then labour demand, rather than individual attributes on the supply side that is seen as the major determinant of the labour market position of individuals and hence also of the distribution of earnings. There is no consensus as to which labour market modelling approach provides the best empirical approximation of actual behaviour and of changes in labour earnings.",

However, as indicated, doubts about the robustness of the parameters derived from existing labour market models may precisely provide one reason for using the more simple non-parametric approach. More critically, perhaps, the simulation results may be path dependent. That is, results might change depending on the choice of the base year when the microsimulation method is applied in a case of analyzing the distributional change between two observed labour market structures. Path dependence could also be a problem in any sequential simulation of changes in labour market conditions. In other words, it could make a difference, given the cumulative effects, whether in an assumed sequence one would first simulate, say, changes in employment by occupational category (<i>O</i>) rather than by sector of employment (<i>S</i>). In the simulation procedure one has to define the sequence upfront; hence, knowing whether the particular sequence in which changes in labour market conditions are imposed matters or not is important.<a href=\"#fn5\"><sup>5</sup></a>",

The interaction terms, in turn, could become large when major shifts in the labour market take place. However, as argued by <a href=\"#bib11\">Ganuza <i>et al</i>. (2002)</a>, there is also an economic logic to the order in which the various effects need to be analyzed. The sequence as typically defined in applications of the non-parametric microsimulation method reproduces the steps used in many labour market models. It is assumed that agents first decide whether to participate or not (<i>P</i>). Then the market defines whether they can find employment or not (<i>U</i>). If they found employment, the adjustment process of the labour market defines in which sector (<i>S</i>) they will be located and the occupation category of their employment (<i>O</i>) (though, in practice, the sector and occupational choice more likely will be a simultaneous process.). Obviously, their decisions as to whether to work or not can be influenced by the relative remuneration, but, once the sector and the occupation in which they obtain employment are defined, the probability of the relative remuneration they will have becomes known. The changes in labour supply and demand in each segment of the labour market are likely to be a factor underlying changes in the remuneration structure for different sex and skill groups, while the change in average level of remuneration is a reflection of the overall performance of the economy. Finally, the skill composition of the workforce is partly a result of demand factors in the labour market, but probably mainly the result of more exogenous changes in endowments. Of course, human capital formation is also likely to be a function of expected earnings in the labour market (see <i>e.g</i>. <a href=\"#bib3\">Behrman, 1999</a>). These are arguments for considering changes in the skill composition as the last step in the sequential simulation.",

The same study for Ecuador also shows that altering the occupational category structure prior to the sector of economic activity structure yields somewhat larger residuals but does not much change the relative importance of the impact of the changes in the labour market variables on outcomes for inequality and poverty.<a href=\"#fn6\"><sup>6</sup></a>",

Changes in rental incomes may be associated with, say, changes in interest rates which likely have economy-wide effects through investment and consumption behaviour. Cash transfers received by individuals or families may affect labour participation behaviour (as it may induce them to work less or not to seek work) and, if significant, could alter outcomes in terms of unemployment and wage rates. As a further example, changes in workers\u2019 remittances from abroad will affect the balance of payments and may influence the real exchange rate, which may trigger further economy wide effects through its impact on exports, production, real wages, and employment. When using the microsimulation method in combination with an economy-wide framework, such as a CGE model, such general equilibrium effects can be taken into account by first simulating the impact of, say, a government transfer programme through the CGE model and then using the resulting labour market outcomes in an application of the non-parametric microsimulation methodology as outlined above.<a href=\"#fn7\"><sup>7</sup></a> This way, both the direct and second-order general equilibrium effects of a transfer on the distribution of per capita household incomes can be accounted for.

In contrast, earnings of skilled workers are projected to decline. Exchange rate depreciation, triggered by the recession at the beginning of the period, is the main cause of this redistribution of labour incomes. In the CGE model, the depreciation would stimulate an export-led recovery in subsequent years mainly benefiting export agriculture and other activities that are relatively intensive in the use of unskilled labour. The increase in demand for this labour category exceeds growth of labour supply (which is exogenous in the CGE model), thus pushing up wages of unskilled workers relative to those of other workers.",

Not surprisingly given the CGE baseline outcomes, changes in the remuneration structure (<i>W<sub>1</sub></i>) exert the stronger impact on changes in poverty. Unskilled workers which are more likely to be poor, see above-average income improvements helping a fair number of them (and their families) climb out of poverty. The increase in the mean remuneration (<i>W<sub>2</sub></i>) also has a visible poverty-reducing impact but weaker than the distributional effect. The changes in unemployment (<i>U</i>) and composition of employment by sector (<i>S</i>) and occupation (<i>O</i>) show as expected no notable effect and also changes in the skill composition of employment are not large enough to affect poverty in any significant way.",

Subsequently, the labour market adjustments as simulated through the CGE model were imposed on the micro dataset in the same sequence as this was done for the baseline simulation. Unsurprisingly, most of the impact on poverty is explained by the direct effect of the transfer (<a href=\"#table5\">Table 5</a>). Moderate poverty falls by 1.6 percentage points in 2011 as compared with the baseline and extreme poverty by 0.8 percentage points. The general equilibrium effects in the form of lower real wages slightly offset the reduction in extreme poverty but show no visible effect on moderate poverty. In 2012, the indirect effects are only slightly larger and the overall finding remains that the transfer helps to reduce poverty despite some adverse side effects on the labour market. The transfer further reduces household income inequality, but only to a small degree. This is a result of the modest size of the transfer.",

The approach assumes that labour markets are segmented and determines (as part of a randomized process) which individuals are expected to move in or out of employment and which move from one employment segment to another based on either known or counterfactual information of aggregate labour market changes. The methodology assumes that the distribution of earnings of those who become employed in a particular segment resembles that of the individuals observed to be employed in that segment. There is no direct link to individual attributes as assumed in the parametric approaches that are rooted in human capital theory and model labour market behaviour based on such attributes. The non-parametric approach does account for (observed or simulated) changes in the composition of the labour force by individual endowments, including skill level and sex.",

Parametric approaches, such as that developed by <a href=\"#bib5\">Bourguignon <i>et al</i>. (2001)</a> require availability of the micro datasets from at least two household surveys. A further advantage of the non-parametric approach is that it facilitates a detailed insight in the relative importance of a range of labour market shifts on household level inequality and poverty, including changes in participation rates, unemployment, employment shifts by sector and occupational category, labour and non-labour income changes and individual endowments (such as skill level).",

The use of a bootstrapping (Monte Carlo) procedure allows to generate confidence intervals and application shows that such intervals typically show narrow margins of error and that only a limited number of repetitions (about 30) tend to be needed to obtain stable confidence intervals. Even so, the approach remains a strong simplification and a fuller specification of labour market behaviour may be preferred. In practice, however, empirical labour market models, especially when applied to developing countries, typically show relatively low explanatory power suggesting much of labour market behaviour is left unexplained. This has been an additional reason to develop the non-parametric approach. If behavioural models leave to much unexplained, then a controlled (<i>i.e</i>. within a pre-defined structure), randomized process of labour market behaviour might be as good an approximation of actual behaviour and with the advantage of saving on modelling effort and computational time.",

Such comparison should be subjected to further research. Based on a by now wide application of the non-parametric method presented here we are confident to conclude that the method is relatively easy to apply and that its outcomes are easy to understand and typically plausible for the labour market outcomes that are simulated. We do not argue that this method is superior to the parametric or behavioural approaches, but it is easy to implement and helps overcome many data constraints to practical applications. The method has also proven to be effective in overcoming insufficient distributional detail present in static and dynamic CGE models to assess the impact of trade, tax reforms or other policy reforms on poverty and income distribution. This combination of CGE modelling and the non-parametric microsimulation method has been applied in a top-down, sequential manner. While this has limitations of its own, it has the advantages of being relatively easy to implement and generating easy-to-understand and tractable outcomes for inequality and poverty.",
