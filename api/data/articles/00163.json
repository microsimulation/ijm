The original Hotelling\u2019s model produces convergences of the two firms to the middle of the line, and homogenous prices. The authors generalise the model to the case of more than two firms in a two-dimensional space. They show that the principle of minimum differentiation does not hold anymore. Firms do not spread uniformly across the space, and firms in more competitive locations charge lower prices and generate less profit.",

The paper provides an original perspective to the challenge of population ageing with the conclusion that the future large increase in pensions\u2019 expenditures can be sustained without changes in the tax system, due to an increase in revenues mostly coming from increases in education.",

The generic behavioural issue is to identify functional relations that are stable enough in context of an evolving policy environment. The paper shows that a well-specified reduced-form, able to capture the effects of policies even if only indirectly, can generate qualitatively similar projections for policy counterfactuals to a structural approach.",

Both statements are bold and disputable, even if they are well argued for. So we published two responses, one by a computer scientist (Dan Tang) and one by an economist (myself), which confute and nuance them.

The paper makes use of no analytical techniques other than logical reasoning and verbal discussion. Second, these opinions are well argued. Third, the topics are open issues in simulation modelling. And finally, the paper fills a void in the microsimulation literature, where discussion of these methodological considerations is largely absent, and consciousness generally low.",

The code, together with a short user guide / readme file, will then be published as an appendix to the published papers, so that any reader will be able to check the results, under the parameterisations identified by the authors.

In particular, they analyse the first-round effects of the proposed tax, transfer and minimum wage reforms on income inequality and poverty. EURO-MOD is also used by Browne and Himmervoll to study the effects of an hypothetical introduction of a comprehensive basic income scheme in Finland, France, Italy and the United Kingdom (<a href=\"#bib6\">Browne &amp; Immervoll, 2017</a>), and by Jara and Schokkaert to analyse how the tax-benefit system affects the distribution of a richer measure of individual well-being than the standard income-based measures, in Sweden (<a href=\"#bib7\">Jara &amp; Schokkaert, 2017</a>). The Ecuadoran and Colombian versions of EUROMOD are used by Bargain, Jara and Rodriguez (Bargain, <a href=\"#bib5\">Jara, &amp; Rodriguez, 2017</a>) to perform a tax-benefit systems swap exercise. Finally, a paper by Olivier Bargain reviews the existing measures of well-being (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bargain, 2017</a>).",
