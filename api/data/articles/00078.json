                "text": "Given the increased availability of survey income data, in this paper we analyse the pros and cons of alternative data sets for static tax-benefit microsimulation in Italy. We focus on all possible alternatives, namely using (a) SHIW or (b) IT-SILC data using a consistent net-to-gross microsimulation model, or (c) IT-SILC data using the gross incomes provided since 2007. Our results suggest that IT-SILC improves in the regional representativeness of the Italian population and does not perform worse than SHIW as for most demographic characteristics, SHIW provides more information regarding building and real estate incomes. Gross income variables simulated by using the net-to-gross module included in the TABEITA microsimulation model and calibrating for tax evasion provide a very precise fit with external statistics. Simulated IT-SILC gross income data fit external aggregate data even better than gross income data provided in IT-SILC, which tend to largely overestimate self-employment income. Finally, we suggest to match IT-SILC with SHIW to include in the former the information on building and real estate incomes that are contained only in the latter. This allows us to reach a very satisfactory validation of the final data set.",

They analysed the family composition and circumstances recorded in the 1980 UK Family Expenditure Survey with the hypothetical family types used in the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) tax-benefit model, finding that only 4% of actual family types were covered by the assumption of the complex DHSS hypothetical family model. Although models based on hypothetical families are still developed and maintained (e.g. <a href=\"#bib35\">OECD, 2010</a>), since the late 1980s virtually all developed countries have at least one model to simulate changes of taxes and benefit on individual incomes (see among others <a href=\"#bib34\">Mitton <i>et al</i>., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gupta &amp; Kapur, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sutherland, 1995</a>) and after the transition from centralized planning to a market economy and the consequent need of financing government policy through taxation, also Eastern and Central European countries showed an increased interest in tax-benefit microsimulation models (see for instance <a href=\"#bib12\">Coulter <i>et al</i>., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Juh\u00e0sz, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lelkes, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lelkes and Sutherland, 2009</a>). In recent years European policy makers have also developed strong interest in the development of harmonized microsimulation models, funding the EUROMODupdate (EMup) project for updating and extending EUROMOD. EUROMOD is a EU-wide microsimulation model aimed to provide estimates of the distributional impact of changes to personal tax and transfer policies taking place at either the national or the European level, to assess the consequences of consolidated social policies, and to understand how different policies in different countries may contribute to common objectives (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sutherland &amp; Figari, 2013</a>).",

Both SHIW and IT-SILC are suitable data sets for microsimulation modelling. However, as they provide income data net of all taxes and social contributions paid, a net-to-gross procedure is required to simulate before-tax income prior to any tax-benefit simulation is performed. Since 2007, Istat complemented the IT-SILC data with gross income data partly simulated and partly produced by exact matching of survey data with administrative ones (see <a href=\"#bib23\">Istat, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Istat, 2011</a>).",

We first suggest that where more than one survey exists, one should be aware of the pros and cons over different dimensions of available surveys to make use of the best one depending on the research question addressed and that an assessment of standard errors of the main statistics considered could also be an important element to consider. By noticing that gross incomes recorded in SILC data (which are often used as input data in microsimulation models across Europe and for the EUROMOD project) provide information on taxes paid on aggregate income variables, whose components are sometimes treated differently by the tax code, we suggest that having a consistent-over-time net-to-gross procedure would allow both more detailed analyses of tax-benefit policies and the use of input data from complementary data sources even in case gross income values were not provided. We also describe the correction of tax evasion of self-employment income as part of the net-to-gross procedure. This is an improvement with respect to a rough correction of the gross income values, which is often used when a net-to-gross procedure is not implemented. Finally, we also suggest that one could make use of matching techniques to match different surveys and enrich the input data used for microsimulation models. This is in fact what we finally suggest here to enrich IT-SILC data with information regarding the value of second homes and other real estate and buildings coming from the SHIW data.",

We will discuss their sample design, unit and item non-response, post-stratification weights and other quality issues (<a href=\"#s2\">Section 2</a>). Then we will briefly present TABEITA, the static microsimulation model used here, focussing on the net-to-gross module. We have been developing TABEITA for over a decade and it is currently used to provide gross income data for the EMup project mentioned above (<a href=\"#s3\">Section 3</a>). Hence, we undertake an assessment of both datasets focussing on socio-demographic variables and comparing them with statistics produced by external sources when available and on net income and their distribution in the Italian population (<a href=\"#s4\">Section 4</a>). Finally we also compare simulated gross income data with gross income variables available in IT-SILC and generated by Istat by using microsimulation and exact matching with administrative data. For the main statistics computed we also provide their standard errors. We show that simulated gross income data using IT-SILC net income data show the best fit with aggregate external statistics, especially when integrated with information on income for other building and real estate earnings (<a href=\"#s5\">Section 5</a>). Finally some conclusions are drawn (<a href=\"#s6\">Section 6</a>).",

In particular, <a href=\"#bib1\">Andrigde and Little (2011)</a> find that the impact of non-response on bias depends primarily on three factors: the non-response rate, the strength of the proxy variable in predicting a variable of interest, and the difference in proxy means for respondents and non-respondents. One of their main findings is that, if non-response is highly correlated with the variable of interest, there can be a large bias even with a high response rate.

In SHIW, post-stratification weights are obtained as follows: first a sampling weight is computed as the inverse of the probability of inclusion of the household in the sample. This weight is then corrected for the overall non-response rate, multiplying it by the inverse of the response rate of the municipality where the unit lives. Finally, this weight is calibrated using statistics about the population on a set of variables (namely, gender, age groups, three main geographical areas \u2013 North, Center, South and Island \u2013 and size of the municipality of residence), and all member of the same household are given the same weight.",

Since 2006 TABEITA has been developed using IT-SILC as the main dataset for two main reasons. Firstly, our comparative analysis of SHIW and IT-SILC data suggested us to prefer the latter, as discussed as discussed in this paper. Secondly, because the EUROMOD model, which uses gross data simulated using TABEITA, requires us to use SILC data for harmonisation of results across the EU.

The second step involves the generation of tax units. Tax units are generated identifying the household head<sup><a href=\"#fn6\">6</a></sup>, linking him/her with his/her spouse (if present and regardless of his/her income) and dependent relatives using information on family relations.

Various interpretation of this could be suggested. Consistently with the tradition of microsimulation with Italian data (see among others, <a href=\"#bib32\">Mantovani, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bernasconi and Marenzi, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fiorio and D\u2019Amuri, 2005</a>), we assume here that the difference comes from the fact that self-employed workers declare in an anonymous interview a higher level of income as opposed to what they actually declare to tax authorities because they have no incentive to hide it. This is a debatable assumption but it simply comes from observing a regularity in the Italian data. Moreover, this assumption does not necessarily contrast with findings of other authors suggesting that self-employed workers declare in anonymous surveys a lower level of disposable income that employees with similar consumption patterns (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pissarides &amp; Weber, 1989</a>), which we do not address here and would simply increase the extent of income concealment by self-employed. Hence, using available external statistics we calibrate reported income of self-employed taxpayers defining a uniform rate of unreported self-employment income. The amount of this unreported income is then subtracted from the tax base <a href=\"#equ3\">(3)</a>, as if it was a tax exempt component of disposable income, and the simulated tax is computed as described above. Disposable income is finally obtained adding to AT income all exempt incomes including calibrated unreported income from self-employment, which we call \u201ctax evasion\u201d. Depending on the year and the survey data used, the calibrated coefficients in TABEITA range between 20% and 30%, which is also remarkably close to estimates of tax evasion for self-employment income provided by <a href=\"#bib24\">Istat (2010a)</a>. This approach could be further improved for instance estimating differential tax evasion rates by income groups or regions, but we preferred to keep it simple in the current application.",

While IT-SILC discrepancies with respect to external sources range from \u22120.9% (Abruzzo and Emilia Romagna) to 1.2% (Valle d\u2019Aosta), SHIW range from \u221225.8% (Abruzzo) to 174.5% (Basilicata).

On the other hand, IT-SILC closely matches external source statistics of the middle age cohort, while it underestimates the youngest cohort and overestimates the older group by a smaller proportion than SHIW. As for SHIW discrepancies can be worryingly large (e.g. \u221217.5% for youngest and +31.8% for oldest group in the Center of Italy).",

On the other hand, SHIW has a larger informational content than IT-SILC about the level of (i) financial and (ii) real estate wealth owned by the households, but the former does not enter the tax base for the Italian PIT and the latter could be used to integrate IT-SILC dataset as we will suggest below.",

In particular, in IT-SILC gross self-employment income is the sum of self employment income, maternity benefits for self-employed and incomes from temporary contract, whereas MEF does not include income from temporary contracts. With respect to employment income, IT-SILC generates gross employment income as sum of employment salary, employment additional compensation, other compensations (profit sharing and bonuses), additional payments based on productivity, income from arrears, and additional months salary. MEF includes in this category also income from temporary jobs, unemployment benefits (for vocational training, redundancy payments, unemployment, mobility or early pension allowances), and private transfers including maintenance payments. Finally, gross pension income in IT-SILC is the sum of old age pensions, survivor\u2019 pensions, disability and invalidity pensions, social pensions. In MEF, instead, social and invalidity pensions are not included as pensions as they are tax exempt and treated as social assistance programs. This implies that, except for total taxable income no validation of IT-SILC data is possible. However, as TABEITA aggregate statistics are built consistently with those published by MEF and the validation exercise reported in <a href=\"#table10\">Table 10</a> is rather satisfactory, one can indirectly assess the validity of IT-SILC gross income data using IT-SILC<sub>T</sub> with evasion, upon appropriate definition of income sources to make it comparable with the three gross income categories provided in IT-SILC. <a href=\"#table11\">Table 11</a> shows that although the difference in total amounts is limited as for pension and employment income, it is large as for self-employment income. In fact, IT-SILC total gross self-employment income is more than 30% larger than what produced with IT-SILC<sub>T</sub>, which is roughly consistent with tax records regarding Irpef and produced by MEF. This is also reflected in a larger gross total taxable income in IT-SILC. Part of this discrepancy could be due to the fact that IT-SILC provides gross self-employment income including also the regional tax on business (Irap), although IT-SILC does not provide information to properly assess this. It however remains that using IT-SILC data instead of IT-SILC<sub>T</sub> one would most likely largely overestimate the amount of taxable income received and tax paid by self-employed taxpayers.",

The main difference between SHIW and IT-SILC is that only the former provides details about imputed rents of not rented second homes and other properties. This explains why the average amount of cadastral income from other building using IT-SILCT is so much underestimated, as IT-SILCT sets this income equal zero lacking appropriate information in the input data set. One may think of ignoring this limitation of IT-SILCT as it accounts for a meagre 1% of total taxable income. However, it could be a large share of income for some households and it could be particularly relevant for specific tax-benefit applications such as those estimating the cost of taxation of real estate and building property income (see <a href=\"#bib3\">Avram <i>et al</i>., 2012</a>).",
