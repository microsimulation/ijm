The paper by Eugenio Zucchelli, Andrew M Jones and Nigel Rice presents an overview of innovative microsimulation methods and applications that are relevant for the purpose of health policy evaluation. Their paper also presents a critical review of existing dynamic microsimulation models that include a health component together with the most recent and comprehensive models focused on health. One of their conclusions, that modellers face a fundamental challenge in defining agents\u2019 dynamic optimising behaviour, pertains not just to health, but to our field in general",

The paper by Sabine Zinn uses the concept of a partnership market, well known in discrete models, and introduces it in continuous-time models. In this partnership market, individuals can enter and leave at any point in time over the complete simulation time range. The algorithm is illustrated using an extended version of the microsimulation tool of the MicMac project.",

Jinjing Li and Cathal O\u2019Donoghue develop a back simulation method that generates a consistent synthetic history panel based on a typical household survey dataset with some complementary statistics. They use this approach to reconstruct the individual labour market trajectory since 1939 for the Living in Ireland (Lil) household survey.",
