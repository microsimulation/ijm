                "text": "We propose a hybrid static spatial microsimulation technique that combines simulated annealing and synthetic reconstruction (Monte-Carlo sampling), in order to generate a synthetic population of individuals as part of a model-based policy indicator. We focus on the following case: (i) the model must produce outputs at a fine spatial resolution; (ii) the individuals have many attributes the majority of which are found in an available micro-data survey, though some attributes are missing and need to be added from other sources. The hybrid method proposed uses simulated annealing to simulate the majority of the required attributes, and Monte-Carlo sampling to add the missing attributes. our paper expands the range of techniques which could produce this type of model. We test the hybrid technique on a UK example estimating the capability of individuals to make journeys by walking and cycling, in order to produce a novel indicator of resilience to the disruption of fuel availability. Additionally, the staged approach means that the intermediate steps in the spatial microsimulation modelling process generate data on bicycle availability and the need to escort children during commuting that are useful in their own right.",

In order to address these particular features, we propose a hybrid spatial microsimulation approach. The hybrid approach combines a first stage, in which the majority of the required attributes are simulated (those available from a micro-data-survey), with a second stage in which the missing attributes are added by Monte-Carlo sampling using data from other sources. The first contribution of the paper is therefore methodological, in terms of setting out the details of the hybrid approach, which we believe has wider applications. The second contribution is in terms of the novelty of the application, and in particular the indicator of the resilience of urban areas to fuel unavailability. Additionally, the staged approach means that the intermediate steps in the spatial microsimulation modelling process generate data that are useful in their own right. We have to generate individual and OA level estimates of bicycle availability and the need to escort children to school as part of commuting.

In principle the indicator might be directly estimated from survey data; however, we believe such an approach to be unsuitable for several reasons. Firstly the data is highly personal and sensitive and it is not placed in the public domain for reasons of confidentiality (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hermes &amp; Poulsen, 2012</a>). Secondly, fine-grained, small area reporting is especially important for a walking and cycling indicator, as journey distances are generally short (<a href=\"#bib33\">Iacono, Krizek, &amp; El-Geneidy, 2010</a>). This is a finer spatial resolution than direct use of survey data can conventionally provide. For example, large surveys such as the Health Survey for England (HSE) typically have respondents from all regions, but not for all smaller zones within each region (<a href=\"#bib19\">Craig, Mindell, &amp; Hirani, 2009</a>). In these cases the sample size for sub-district level analyses would typically be so small to be subject to large margins of error. For example, when the Active People Survey data was analysed to produce estimates using the UK census geography \u2013 Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOA) , the researchers themselves expressed concern over the high margins of error in some areas (<a href=\"#bib34\">IPSOS MORI, 2007</a>).",

We believe this, rather than a more aggregate level model, is especially justified in our application for several reasons. Firstly, excessive aggregation in policy analysis can be problematic, with a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach to policy leading to dilution of investment, untargeted interventions and poor outcomes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ballas <i>et al</i>., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Openshaw, 1995</a>). Individual level modelling allows small unit reporting, which, also goes some way to alleviating the modifiable area unit problem (<a href=\"#bib47\">Openshaw, 1984</a>), and by making analysts mindful of the heterogeneity of areas helps to avoid the ecological fallacy. Secondly there is individual variation across multiple attributes, which interact to influence the indicator and aggregate data based on; for example the mean attribute value would fail to adequately consider this variation. Locating concentrations of individuals at the extremes of the distribution of capability is likely to be of particular interest to policy makers. Taking the national mean of individual attributes would be an inadequate measure, as it would not help identify those key people at the extremes of the distribution of capability. For this reason, even disaggregation by age and gender (for example, taking the average fitness level for population segments such as men over 50) may be too coarse.",

Firstly, the synthetic population has to represent many attributes. <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a> defines the wide range of data sources required to produce the indicator. Not all the required attributes are available in a single micro-data sample, most are available in the HSE anonymised micro-data, the other attributes are found in other data sets. Secondly, the case study includes all the phases of spatial microsimulation modelling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In the first phase (synthetic population generation) attributes are simulated directly from the data. Phase 2 takes the synthesised attributes produced in phase 1, from which further attributes can be derived such as VO<sub>2</sub>max<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> (ml/litre of blood/kg body mass) and pedalling power. Local environmental variables representing features such as topography and wind are then also introduced. The individual model then estimates an individual\u2019s capability to make walking and cycling journeys.

To be of practical use there should be conditional probability distributions for the occurrence of each attribute combination. Secondly one or more constraint tables are needed.

In our application, it is not possible to find all the attributes in the same micro-data sample.

Commute distance is strongly associated with location as well as individual socio-demographic attributes. Commute distance is collected in some micro-data surveys, but, it would not be appropriate to allocate this value out of its original spatial context as individual survey data has geographical detail removed, meaning that we would not be able to ensure that we connect a simulated individual to an appropriate commute distance based on the area to which they are assigned.",

However using it alone would forgo the reported performance advantages of simulated annealing at the smallest geographies as well as neglecting the practical benefits of not having to consider the order of constraints or the potential for adding additional attributes to individuals. The imputation approach appears to be a practical solution where existing appropriate synthetic populations are available, but this may not always be the case. In some cases a population may already exist containing most attributes required, and the hybrid technique may take what is in effect a partially constructed population and add to it. Another option is that there may be a number of micro-data sources. In some cases it might be quicker to use a hybrid technique rather than generate a synthetic population for each micro-data source then undergo multiple iterations of imputation. In these cases sample- free synthetic reconstruction may be better suited for some applications, but there remain some applications where the user wishes to use combinatorial optimisation. Introducing Monte-Carlo sampling in the second stage of our technique creates a source of stochastic variation. This is not a problem if a suitable number of iterations are made; the standard error of the mean should not be excessive.",

The internal validation process indicates the extent to which the synthetic population\u2019s attributes match the aggregate counts of the real population\u2019s constrained attributes. The results are summarised in <a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a>. These showed the poorest fitting constraint to be NSSEC by gender, a 20-class, cross-tabulated constraint (percent cell error value of 9.2). We reconstructed this constraint as a uni-variate constraint with only 3 NSSEC categories, and this greatly reduced the percent cell error. The percent cell error of the simulated annealing stage constrained attributes was an average of 0.065% per attribute using the 3 category NSSEC constraint. This compares favourably to that achieved by <a href=\"#bib27\">Harland <i>et al</i>., (2012)</a>, who achieved zero error for constrained attributes at OA resolution, whereas the synthetic reconstruction and deterministic reweighting average error per constraint was 0.96% and 14.15% respectively (source <a href=\"#bib27\">Harland <i>et al</i>., 2012</a> in their <a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a>). In Stage 2 the commute distance attribute is available in the census, so can be internally validated. The mean percent cell error was 0.76% per attribute, performing well when compared to <a href=\"#bib27\">Harland <i>et al</i>., (2012)</a>.

The spatial distribution of uncertainty informs policy makers where indicator results should be treated with greater caution, and may also be used as a basis to target future resources for refining the model (i.e. to reduce error). From the analysis leading to <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, it was seen that many of the OAs with error over 7.6% are in the suburban areas, between 5km and 8km from the city centre. Many individuals in these OAs have a mean maximum travel distance in the range 5\u20138km and a commute distance in the same range. In OAs where commute distance and maximum travel distance are similar, small errors in the estimation of individual attributes (from which the maximum travel distance is derived) have a larger effect on the error. one attribute from which maximum travel distance is derived is bicycle availability. Comparing <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a> shows, bike availability is high in many of the oAs with high error. Small errors in estimating bicycle availability (as simulated in each iteration of the second stage of the hybrid model) will therefore have a relatively large effect on the estimate of capability of individuals to make journeys in the 5\u20138km range.",

The simulated annealing stage was run using a parallelised Java application (<a href=\"#bib26\">Harland, 2013</a>) taking 4 hours when the simpler 3 way construction of the NSSEC constraint was used and 30 hours with the cross-tabulated NSSEC by gender constraint.

When simulating only Leeds (the case study reported in the paper), rather than the whole of England, the run time was approximately 30 minutes for Stage 2. Run-times could potentially be reduced through improvements in the coding of the SQL database, though the time required for synthetic population generation is not a major concern as it is typically done only once, and then used as an input to phases 2 and 3 of the microsimulation modelling process shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>.",
