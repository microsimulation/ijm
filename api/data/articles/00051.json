                "text": "This paper investigates two questions regarding closely held corporations. First, possible differences between closely and widely held corporations are explored. Second, a model is developed to investigate what factors and to what extent these factors influence a person to become an active owner of a closely held corporation. A background to the first question is that profits in closely held corporations in Sweden may be taxed as labour income, with a progressive marginal tax, while profits in corporations with broad ownership are taxed as capital income, at a flat rate. If the expected return after tax is lower in closely held corporations compared to corporations with a broad ownership, entrepreneurs and investors will demand a higher pre-tax risk-adjusted return. Evidence from Swedish data, covering all Swedish corporations, does not seem to reject these hypotheses. The model developed to address the second question utilizes extensive individual panel data. Some simple simulations are carried out, indicating that changes in taxation have important impact on the propensity to become a closely held corporation owner. A conclusion is that the tax-system restrains entrepreneurship and potentially employment and growth. Some suggestions to improve and expand the model are issued. Remaining key questions are e.g. how do changes in the tax rules for closely held corporations affect efficiency aspects with significance for e.g. employment, government tax revenue and income distribution.",

This paper is primarily interested in effects from tax schemes and tax structures on incentives to start up and become an active owner of a CHC. Research on this topic must be interpreted carefully, since differences in tax structures between countries prevents conclusions drawn for one country to be applied to other countries. For example, empirical results regarding the effects of income taxes on self-employment in Sweden often contradict in studies on US-Canada data compared. This is because income from small businesses to a large extent has been taxed as labour income in Sweden. On the other hand, the structure in the US is much more generous to profit making firms, and an income transfer from employment to self-employment is much more profitable in the US than in Sweden <sup><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup>.",

All taxes, e.g. pay roll taxes, taxes on capital gains and corporate taxes have impact on the tax wedge. However, not only the tax wedge, but also the general tax level has an impact on the level of self-employment. Probably the most important reason for this is that many studies find a lack of capital to be the main obstacle for potential entrepreneurs. High taxes make it more difficult to gather the necessary capital from savings and thus prevent a potential entrepreneur to start up an enterprise. <a href=\"#bib5\">De Mooij and Nicod\u00e8me (2007)</a> use data from 17 European countries between 1997 and 2003 to find large and significant effects from the size of the tax wedge between income from employment and incorporated self-employed. <a href=\"#bib11\">Gordon &amp; Cullen (2002)</a> conclude that \u201ctax policy and macroeconomic policies seem to be key factors generating entrepreneurial activity.\u201d <a href=\"#bib10\">Gordon (2006)</a> compares the tax systems in USA and sweden and concludes that the regulations in Sweden punish business failures much harder than in the USA.

However, when comparing results from different countries, the effect of income taxes on self-employment is ambiguous. One explanation is disparity in tax structures. Any regulations determining whether incomes are taxed as labour income, capital income and/or corporate income are of importance, and the same goes for the framework of rules determining deductibility of losses. Another important factor is the possibilities of smoothing incomes over time. We have not found any literature highlighting this aspect. In Sweden, for example, a corporation can allocate up to 25 percent of net profits to a tax allocation reserve that must be liquidated after six years. Additionally, in businesses organised as sole proprietors and partnerships, profits can be taxed as a corporate profit and funded into the corporation for infinite time. This fund can be used as a carry back instrument to smooth profits over time, a mechanism not available in limited corporations.<sup><a href=\"#fn7\">7</a></sup>",

But taxes can also affect the existing firms\u2019 investment behaviour (and hence employment) through the taxation of capital income. More traditional theories state that taxation at the ownership level is irrelevant to the supply of capital for investments, since a firm will find sufficient capital in an open economy as soon as risk-adjusted rate of return of the investment meets the equilibrium rate of return established in the international financial market. Thus, domestic taxation affecting the owner level would (only) affect the level of private savings, but taxation enforced at the company level would affect investments as well.",

One explanation for this is that information is costly and complex to produce, provide and verify. There is always a case of asymmetric information, since a large or foreign investor has few possibilities to access and verify relevant information on investment opportunities in small, or perhaps not even yet started, companies. Secondly, there is a liquidity problem associated to small firm assets and a third possible reason is that these assets seldom are divisible. An investor will be stuck with the investment for a period of time as there is no regular market to trade the asset in. For these reasons, the only available investors for small business usually are the three \u201cF:s\u201d: family, friends and (perhaps) fools. Bearing this in mind, it seems fair to assume that, as a result of this restricted access to capital markets, domestic taxation at the owner level may in fact influence investments. But taxing business incomes may also impact investment decisions. If business income is taxed heavily, only business ideas with sufficiently high pre-tax high profitability or pretax rates of return will be undertaken. Assuming that a high rate of return comes with high risk, investment projects may shift towards higher-risk projects.",

But higher risk levels should result in increasing resistance from banks providing loans. So more than other firms, taxation of business incomes may induce small firms to take more risk, and therefore to decrease their opportunities to receive funds from the capital market, which means that they will have to use private savings, venture capital or similar private equity structures.",

However, any capital income exceeding certain limits \u2013 so called limitation amount (<i>gr\u00e4nsbelopp</i>) \u2013 are reclassified as labour income and taxed under the progressive rates. If the stock owner in a CHC has an ordinary labour income leaving him or her at the top marginal tax rate, any income from the qualified stocks therefore may be taxed at a rate of 57 per cent. The frame work of rules determining the limitation amount is complex and based on the company\u2019s equity, wage sum, the interest rate and several other parameters.<sup><a href=\"#fn8\">8</a></sup>",

Previously, the rules were considered to be quite harsh for the tax payers, often forcing them to pay the full marginal tax rate of 57 per cent on income emanating from their business. Through the 2006 reform the situation is changed to some extent. From the tax payers\u2019 point of view, the two major advantages of the reform are the introduction of a lower tax rate for capital income (20 or 25 per cent as opposed to the regular rate of 30 per cent previous to the reform) and a more generous calibration of the rules determining the limitation amount. In particular, owners to companies with a large wage sum benefit from the favourable rules, allowing them large dividends or capital gains, without risk to have these income reclassified and taxed under the full marginal tax regime up to 57 per cent. On the other hand some advantages of the previous system were changed, most importantly was the abolishment of the partial single taxation up to a certain (low) rate of return. Due to the fact that the reform had a rather large number of components, some with positive impact and some with negative impact, it is hard to make comparisons. Moreover, the impact of the reform is dependent on quite a few circumstances within the company; for example, the impact will be very different depending on the company\u2019s capital structure and its number of employees. Dividend and financial policy prior to the reform will also be of importance when comparisons are made between CHC\u2019s and WHC\u2019s before and after the 2006 reform.",

A simple comparison to investments in the regular stock market would suggest that closely held corporations were treated favourably by the tax system when they yielded a low rate of return but less favourable when they yielded a normal, or above normal rate of return. This suggests that for most levels, small company investments required a higher rate of return, and therefore higher risk, in order to yield the same net of tax rate of return as a stock market investment. Following this line of reasoning, one would expect that in equilibrium there would be an average of higher rates of return for small companies than for stock market investments. One would therefore anticipate a higher risk level in smaller companies. This would then have implications on the structure of financing in smaller companies, compared to other companies. Up to a certain point, the possibility to finance in the banking sector may be equivalent for smaller and for larger companies. But higher risk levels should result in increasing resistance from banks providing loans. To put it simple, banks avoid high risk. Higher risk business ideas may not gain financing through bank loans. Typically, higher risk financing may instead come from different forms of equity, such as domestic informal investments, business angels, venture capital or similar private equity structures.",

The main reason is that proprietors are liable to social security tax as well as progressive personal labour income tax on capital gains in excess of the imputed return to equity, unless the gain stems from the sale of real estate. A start-up firm subject to the tax rules for widely held corporations faces the lowest tax burden. The unadjusted and risk-adjusted tax burdens on a start-up firm organized as a closely held corporation are somewhat higher, but still far below those on proprietorships.

The solvency margin may vary between companies e.g. according to line of industry, but as a general rule of thumb a company\u2019s will improve its chances to find investors and to get favourable conditions regarding required rate of return etc. if it has a high solvency margin. There is a difference between CHC\u2019s and WHC\u2019s solvency margin of around 10 percentage points. During the period of time studied, the difference is quite stable. This observation seems to support the hypothesis that CHC\u2019s have to compensate a higher average risk through a larger portion of equity capital.",

In fact, the difference in profitability between CHC\u2019s and WHC\u2019s rises in the end of the period. This would be a bit of a surprise, since tax rules have been relaxed since 2006. To some extent, time lag could explain this, as profitability in a certain year may originate from investment decisions made some years earlier, under a different tax regime.",

Favourable impact from the business cycle probably explains at least part of this. There is probably a time lag from any employment effects emanating from the 2006 change of tax rules.

As mentioned in <a href=\"#s2-1\">Section 2.1</a>, a common explanation has to do with the taxation of high income, and how this taxation differs whether a person is an employee or self-employed. This difference is much smaller in Sweden than in the US. In Sweden only a limited part of the earnings in a CHC can be taxed at a lower rate, i.e. as income from capital.

Therefore, it would be interesting to develop a corporate model that could simulate how corporations evolve over time. Given the individual start-up decision, such a corporate model also could simulate how decisions affect the firm\u2019s destiny, and the yield to the owner(s).",

The observed differences suggest that the Swedish tax system discriminates CHC\u2019s. Moreover, the differences indicate that the tax system forces the CHC\u2019s to undertake more risky investments in order to counteract the higher tax rate. Higher risk decreases supply and increases cost of foreign capital, distorting the capital structure. Excessive solidity along with a personal relation to the corporation may be explaining factors to the higher survival rate among CHC\u2019s. Since the recent tax reforms, aiming to reduce the tax burden on owners of CHC\u2019s, the number of CHC\u2019s, as well as the number of employees in CHC-firms, have increased. It may still be too early to draw any stronger conclusions, but these increases may be seen as further indications confirming our hypothesis.",
