                "text": "The sub-field of dynamic microsimulation modelling, the inter-temporal simulation of micro units over time, was one of the original areas of microsimulation. A number of surveys have documented progress in the field at approximately 7 year intervals over time. Reviewing developments over the decade 2013-2023, we find that progress in the field is accelerating, as nearly half the papers published in the field have been published since the last survey article. It is timely therefore to provide a more recent survey and critical assessment of the direction of the field. This paper reviews the evolution of dominant methodological choices. However given the increased scale of the sub-field, we make use of bibliometric tools to assist in the analysis of the field. There has been a clear change in direction over the past 8 years. Previous research could be classified in two clusters, largely divided into closed, aligned, discrete time and open, non-aligned continuous time frameworks, both with family units of analysis. However, the dominant current direction in the field has been the introduction of more parsimonious model particularly in the health sphere. These papers typically use an individual unit of analysis, are non-aligned and have simpler behavioural and simulation structures, with a greater focus on the particular health policy application.",

As the complexity of a model increases, the cost in terms of development run-time, validation, analysis time and consequential sources of error increase at a faster non-linear rate. More complex models are thus more costly, time consuming, harder to interpret. This is certainly my experience in microsimulation model development. It would be useful to quantitatively assess these trade-offs. Although minimising complexity is common sense, it is not always common practice. The choice of minimising complexity does not necessarily mean that we avoid complex problems. Rather the solution may be in developing multiple tools, each of which is less complex and thus much easier to validate, rather than developing a large-scale multi-purpose model.",

A lot of work has been undertaken for dynamic micro-simulation model engines as in the case of MODGEN, LIAM2, JASMINE etc. The landscape is much better now than it used to be where earlier models had to \u201creinvent the wheel\u201d in developing new models. Run-time has improved through the better programming in the generalised frameworks resulting in much faster runs than in the \u201camateur\u201d model frameworks from earlier (<a href=\"#bib7\">De Menten et al., 2014</a>). In reality however, the analysis time is likely to be longer than the simulation run-time as it can take a lot of time to interpret and validate results. Analysis also typically involves more interactive engagement with the data, while simulations can take place in the background. So in essence, the analytical time is more expensive from the researcher\u2019s point of view. There are opportunities for more off the shelf analytic tools for dynamic microsimulation analysis, however the bulk of the time spent in analysis is in the human interaction, rather than defining the calculations. In addition, most analyses are relatively idiosyncratic, meaning that it can be difficult define in advance.",

Returning to our parsimony discussion, producing a system of equations that result in realistic simulations is challenging, whether it be plausible heterogeneity, inter-temporal volatility or inertia, particularly when short panels are used in their estimation. Small errors in a single year iteration in inter-temporal simulation can blow up into large errors over the length of a simulation. It is surprising therefore how little effort there has been in sharing this part of the simulation process. In other words, it might be possible to utilise statistical equations from one country in the development of a model for another country. For models that are aligned, and for countries with a similar social and economic structure it is likely that simply varying calibration totals, while using another country\u2019s estimated equations will not lose too much power. This was the approach when the DYNACAN (<a href=\"#bib22\">Morrison, 1997</a>) team started to use the CORSIM (<a href=\"#bib4\">Caldwell et al., 1999</a>) modelling framework, starting initially with US equations and gradually moving to Canadian specific equations over time.",

In my experience PRISMA is ideal when there is a clear narrow question to be considered. While for more open ended less clear approaches such as describing models is it less helpful. However at the same time the ad hoc approach of most previous survey articles in microsimulation is unsystematic and given the growing field not appropriate. The approach taken here is to draw upon the PRISMA approach in categorising the search using the approach defined, but allowing for both a combination of additional papers that are not picked up by the narrow search, but also to sample or exclude uncited grey literature to keep the sample manageable. One could interpret the approach as PRISMA Lite.",

Comparative analyses have spanned different sub-fields, including health, income distribution and pensions. The increase in comparative analysis has developed in a slightly different way to static microsimulation in that it did not evolve by more countries with national models agreeing that they wanted to do a comparative exercise and then developing a comparative framework like EUROMOD (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sutherland and Figari, 2013</a>).

Journal articles have the highest citation scores across publication types, with books and book chapters having the second highest citation score. A particular point to note is that the majority of journal articles on dynamic microsimulation models are occurring in mainstream health and social science journals with only 15 of the 118 journal articles considered in this review being published in a simulation journal.

Previous research could be classified in two clusters, largely divided into closed, aligned, discrete time and open, non-aligned continuous time frameworks, both with family units of analysis. However, the dominant current direction in the field has been the introduction of more parsimonious model particularly in the health sphere. These papers typically use an individual unit of analysis, are non-aligned and have simpler behavioural and simulation structures, with a greater focus on the particular health policy application. The nowcasting models have also adopted the strengths of the dynamic microsimulation approach, but simplifying to make them relevant during analysis of crises. To some extent the papers represented in the IMA World Congress to do not reflect the changed direction of the field, with a higher proportion of papers reflecting the traditional maximal model approach compared with the more parsimonious approach found in journal articles.",

In my experience, advising various teams and in doing my own work, there has been a tendency to build in complexity, so to consider what potential uses the model might have rather than what is sufficient now. Frequently models do not survive long enough to realise all of the potential gains from the model. Many of models and institutions that were prominent in the last systematic review prepared in 2013/4 are no longer there such as NATSEM, CORSIM and DYNACAN. As a result, inbuilt flexibility is not always exploited.",

This traditional approach informed my priors in analysing the current trends. However, what is clear from the analysis of the published papers, particularly in the latter part of the decade, is that field is moving rapidly away from the traditional classification as the field has moved away from almost an exclusively household income distribution perspective. It is a reflection on the progress of the field, which had been a worry in <a href=\"#bib15\">Li and O\u2019Donoghue (2013)</a>, that these priors no longer hold.

The impact of issues such as housing costs will in fact add to the complexity required. Is there a way forward for teams and agencies without access to these large scale resources? It may however be that increasing use of static ageing techniques or calibrated cross-sections (as in nowcasting) combined with dynamic ageing to provide histories might help to reduce the computational complexity of dealing with these issues. Static ageing has been dismissed as a methodology for pensions analysis. There may be merits in assessing a combination of simpler individual focused career trajectories combined with static aged household structures as an intermediate solution to these diverging trends. An advantage of this approach, used in nowcasting is that scenario analyses or foresight type analyses can be undertaken without the overhead of doing longitudinal simulations of full cross-sections.",
