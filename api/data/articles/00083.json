Random assignment provides the basis for one such method. The idea of random assignment is usually associated with selecting individuals for treatment groups in such a way that the effect of the treatment is the only source of difference in outcomes between the groups. However, in the context of microsimulation modelling, random assignment is a kind of matching or imputation technique where a donor is selected on the basis of its similarity or closeness to the receiving unit. <a href=\"#bib12\">Klevmarken (1997)</a> provides an example of how a random assignment scheme can be used as a method of projecting a variable over time. Data is available on a set of incomes for two consecutive years along with some related variables such as age and sex. It is desired to project the income distribution for the following year. This is done by first defining a distance metric between a donor\u2019s variables in year 1 and a receiver\u2019s variables in year 2. The essence of the procedure is that the income for each case in year 3 is obtained by finding a donor, whose characteristics in year 1, are similar to those of the current case in year 2. The receiver\u2019s income in year 3 is then assigned to be what the donor\u2019s income subsequently became in year 2.",

They found that this approach had the potential to provide better population projections than the alternative interaction based models. However, they also noted that the representation of behaviour is limited to what has already been observed in the initial data set. This is not a problem when it is desired only to project, all other things being equal, from current data but it is a limitation when applying the method in new situations because the behaviour and correlation structure are locked in to what has been observed. However, the issue of how to extrapolate from observed data is common to all approaches. In microsimulation, this is often done by applying some kind of alignment procedure.

This means that, as household incomes rise, total expenditure will increase at a slower rate than income. Aside from total expenditure, a significant amount of research has been done on how the share of expenditure for goods varies with income. As far back as 1857, Engel found that the budget share for food decreases as household income increases (<a href=\"#bib5\">Engel, 1857</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">1895</a>). More recently, ONS figures (<a href=\"#bib15\">ONS, 2008</a>) indicated that households in the highest income decile spend a greater proportion of their expenditure on \u2018transport\u2019 and \u2018education\u2019 while spending a smaller proportion on \u2018housing\u2019 and \u2018food\u2019 compared to the lowest income decile.",

Following a review of freely available ABM platforms, NetLogo (<a href=\"#bib21\">Wilensky, 1999</a>) was chosen, largely on the basis of its simple yet powerful scripting language. In addition, it has straightforward file input/output facilities and an efficient graphical user interface.

There are many ways this can be done and the selection of which particular method to use will depend on the application and available data. <a href=\"#bib14\">O\u2019Hare (2000)</a> describes several approaches for matching similar cases. These include minimum distance matching, where the donor case is chosen due to its closeness on one or more parameters. A common distance function is the normalised Euclidian distance \u221a\u2211(x<sub>i</sub> - y<sub>i)</sub><sup>2</sup> where x<sub>i</sub> and y<sub>i</sub> are the parameters for case i. This can be extended for as many parameters as required. One of the advantages of minimum distance matching is that it can be used on continuous data. If the data are categorical, matching can take place by random selection of a donor case within the same class. These methods can be combined in matching by minimum distance within classes. A further option that could be explored is to use cluster analysis to define equivalence classes and select the donor case from within the appropriate cluster. In the simulation described here, matching takes place using household income, the number of people in the household and a derived variable known as household type. In O\u2019Hare\u2019s classification, this is minimum distance within classes.",

As a result, income, by definition, will be one of the matching criteria. It is represented as if it were a continuous variable so there are no income bands. In many cases, there is not an exact match for a particular income so it is necessary to find the closest alternative. In this implementation, for half of the cases (selected by a random draw), the household with the next higher income is selected as the donor. In the other half, the next lower income household is used. If more than one household satisfies the matching criteria, one of them is selected at random.",

If there are no appropriate donors, all expenditures are changed in proportion to the desired income change and no copying is done for that household in the current cycle.",

This is in agreement with the first two stylised facts, identified above, that expenditures rise with rising income but at a slower rate. As mentioned earlier, the additional income goes partly on income tax, some is saved or invested and some is spent on non-consumption items. This includes mortgage interest payments, which appear in the EFS category \u2018other expenditure\u2019. In addition, capital repayment of mortgage is not counted as consumption expenditure.",

The \u2018Final Share\u2019 is the budget share for the item after incomes were inflated as described above. \u2018Shift in Budget Share\u2019 is the difference between the initial and final share. Due to the stochastic nature of the simulation, there is some variation from one run to the next. As a result, it is not possible to know whether the results from a single instance are typical or unusual. Running the simulation a few times will provide information on how much random variation takes place between runs. This can be quantified in a number of ways such as calculating the difference between maximum and minimum values of the output for a particular parameter, obtained from a number of runs or from their standard deviation. It is also possible to calculate confidence intervals for the results and the next column of <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a> gives the 95% confidence interval of the final budget share for each expenditure category. The last two columns of <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a> show the upper and lower bounds of the confidence intervals. The results are the mean of three simulations. The variation is assumed to be normally distributed because the process generating the deviations is the random assignment scheme itself. While this gives some indication of the variability of the model, it gives no indication of the accuracy of the model specification.",

The matching scheme used here selects a donor case and from there, any variables from the donor can be copied to the receiver. As a result, there is no restriction on the number of goods that can be modelled. In principle, every item in the EFS could be represented and the complexity of the model would rise linearly with the number of goods. Also, since the individual households are retained, the distribution of variables is preserved and output can be produced at the micro-level.",

                    "text": "This does not mean the method is without pitfalls. As was mentioned above, selecting cases on a parameter such as increasing income means that all the variables from the case will be available for copying and some of these will be correlated with income. If the change in income really causes the change in another variable, this can be used to determine the effect of the former on the latter. However, if the change in income does not cause the change, such as when income does not cause household size to increase, this will lead to an inaccurate estimation of the effect because the simulated households change in a way that real households do not. This can be minimised by including more variables in the matching criteria to limit the household\u2019s response to changing conditions. A sensitivity analysis can be done by adding matching criteria, one by one, until the change in output reduces to an acceptable level. A regression of the matching variables on the output variables will indicate how much of the variation is explained by the model and so give an indication of its reliability. The problem of model specification is not unique to random assignment and all modelling methods can be done well or badly whatever approach is taken.",

It is based on a cross-sectional dataset and assumes that households will respond to a change in circumstances by adjusting their spending patterns to become more like those that have already experienced the new conditions. This may have some plausibility but it is also reasonable to suppose that households would try to retain as much of their original behaviour as possible. It would be feasible to model this by using a longitudinal dataset and copying from donors that have experienced a similar change over time. Unfortunately, the EFS is a repeated cross-sectional survey and there are currently no large-scale longitudinal panel surveys, in the UK at least, that monitor detailed household spending categories over time.",

                    "text": "Random assignment is related to statistical matching, which is used in microsimulation to combine data from a number of different sources or files. Here, individual cases are matched on the basis of the similarity between one or more variables which are common to both sources (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ingram <i>et al</i>., 2001</a>). However, the random assignment scheme applied in this paper is essentially different from statistical matching because records are matched from within the same dataset. This makes it more akin to hot deck imputation where missing variables are obtained from a similar case that has a complete set of variables (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andridge &amp; Little, 2010</a>). Hot deck imputation is often used in surveys, where respondents may decline to answer some or all of the questions. This is particularly problematic because different respondents may have different propensities for omitting data so leading to biased results. A range of methods has been developed to ameliorate this problem such as propensity score matching (<a href=\"#bib17\">Rosenbaum &amp; Rubin, 1983</a>) and multiple imputation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Rubin, 1987</a>). Here, the imputation process is repeated a number of times account for the variability or uncertainty in the results, which is lost in a single imputation. This allows an accurate statistical description of the resulting micro-level data file to be made. The model described above also made use of multiple runs to average out the random element of the imputation. This invites the possibility of combining the two approaches and further work in this area may prove fruitful.",
