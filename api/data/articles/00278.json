I know that this issue will be read with great sadness as we remember Ann\u2019s vision as founder of the International Microsimulation Association (IMA) and the first president from 1993 to 2011. Many will recall her enthusiastic welcome and friendship as the host of the first World Congress of the IMA. For readers who did not know Ann, we hope that through the publication of some of her most important papers that have not yet seen the light of the day in journal form, and tributes from those who knew her well, you will gain an appreciation for her contribution to the field of microsimulation, particularly in the area of poverty and income distribution, and her great passion for public policy influence for the greater good.",

When given the support to establish NATSEM, she set about building a reputation for excellence in every aspect of the Centre\u2019s work. Careful attention was paid to NATSEM\u2019s branding including the choice of the identifiable teal colour and commissioning of a logo design (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Ann was determined that NATSEM and each and every one of her young staff succeed. Using her skills from her brief career as a journalist, Ann edited every paper before it was published to ensure that it was well written and accessible to a broad readership. Understanding the importance of the media, she commissioned two high profile media personalities to teach the new NATSEM team how to prepare for an interview: to have three key messages prepared; how to maintain the focus of the interview; and how to respond under pressure. At the time we just assumed that this was just how things were done, but in hindsight her leadership from the outset reflected her capacity as a true visionary (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).",

I was fortunate enough to be a founding staff member of NATSEM and a member of the team tasked with developing STINMOD. In an environment where excellence was encouraged, we had free reign to make the most of the newly acquired skills that three of us had gained, having recently undertaken post-graduate qualifications in computer science. Within 18 months we had completed STINMOD and designed a user-friendly state-of-the-art GUI interface. STINMOD proved to be very influential and had longstanding policy influence, being used in every budget and election for over two decades. It was used within major government agencies by staff with modelling skills. With the provision of a user-friendly interface, access extended further to staff from the parliamentary library and not-for-profit groups.",

Ann took great pleasure in welcoming many of our colleagues from the northern hemisphere to the first IMA conference in Canberra at the Australian Academy of Science. The conference was a relaxed event with opportunities to build networks and friendships at the conference picnic at Tidbinbilla and the conference dinner Ann hosted for attendees at her home in Belconnen, where kangaroos appeared in the adjoining grassland to the delight of international visitors. Ann\u2019s foresight and leadership has gifted us a global network of microsimulation modelling experts who are not only extremely skilled, but collaborative, generous and deeply engaged with policy.",

Ann was never threatened by her staff\u2019s success, but rather became their unerring champion, generous and genuine in her praise.
