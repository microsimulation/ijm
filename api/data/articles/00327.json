                "text": "This paper develops a microsimulation model to simulate the distributional impact of price changes using Household Budget Survey data, income survey data, and an Input-Output Model. The primary purpose of this paper is to describe the model components. The secondary purpose is to demonstrate one component of the model by assessing the distributional and welfare impact of recent price changes in Pakistan. Over the period of November 2020 to November 2022, headline inflation in Pakistan was 41.5%, with food and transportation prices increasing most. The analysis shows that despite large increases in energy prices, their importance for the welfare losses is limited because energy budget shares are small. The overall distributional impact of recent price changes is mildly progressive, with significant impacts on household welfare across the expenditure distribution. The biggest driver of welfare losses at the bottom of the expenditure distribution was food price inflation, while inflation in other goods and services was the biggest driver at the top. To compensate households for increased living costs, transfers would need to be on average 40% of pre-inflation expenditure. Behavioural responses to price changes have a negligible impact on the overall welfare cost to households.",

It can also simulate policies to compensate households for increased living costs and estimates households\u2019 behavioural response to income and price changes, and the impacts on household welfare. A central contribution of PRICES is its ability to account for interactions between indirect and environmental taxes, inflation, compensation measures, and household behaviour. In combining multiple modules and standardized data sources, the model provides a scalable and flexible framework to estimate the welfare impact of a wide range of price shocks, and is particularly apt for comparative research, across developed and developing countries.

The EUROMOD ITT however only covers some EU countries, and does not estimate income and price elasticities.

Modelling the full impact of taxes on GHG emissions requires tracing the impact of taxes on prices along the value chain and households ability to adjust their consumption behaviour to avoid the tax. Input-Output (IO) tables are required to model externality-correcting taxes, such as carbon taxes, because these taxes impact the cost of inputs, particularly energy, used in the production process of all goods and services. Integrating an IO model allows incorporating the impact of indirect taxes on consumer prices through two channels; the (indirect) impact on the consumer goods through their impact on production inputs, and the (direct) impact on consumer goods levied at the point of sale. As expenditure datasets frequently do not include prices or quantities, this requires information on energy prices collected from external sources or directly from IO databases.",

In a modelling environment, this means that models need to estimate the level of pollution associated with the production and consumption of goods, to adjust the price of these goods accordingly, and estimate the extent to which households respond to these price changes. Estimates of household\u2019s responsiveness to price changes also form the basis of estimates of the welfare effects of policies, such as the Compensating Variation (CV). CV gives the monetary value required to maintain households\u2019 utility following a price increase. This is a particularly workable indicator for policymakers looking to compensate households.",

Secondly, countries are implementing and raising carbon prices, including major economies such as the EU, Australia, Japan, California, and China. Distributional impacts of price changes are a key concern for political stability and social cohesion. Regarding carbon pricing and indirect tax reform, distributional concerns are relevant for political acceptability of reforms, and regressive impacts can lead to major political opposition (<a href=\"#bib52\">Dechezlepr\u00eatre et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Douenne and Fabre, 2022</a>).

While direct impacts can be modelled using information on tax rates and consumer expenditure, modelling indirect impacts requires information on the inputs used by firms to produce consumer goods. This information is contained in Input-Output tables. In the PRICES model, we use the Input-Output model to compute indirect impacts of carbon pricing on the price of consumer goods, accounting for the full impact of the carbon price.

We therefore use total expenditure as income concept and rank households based on their total expenditure. The use of expenditure as income concept overestimates incomes of low-income households and underestimates income of high-income households, because savings rates are commonly negative at the bottom of the distribution and increase with income. Consequently, using expenditure as income concept results in more progressive estimates (<a href=\"#bib76\">Hassett et al., 2009</a>).

With expenditure data, validating the imputed totals against official statistics, such as National Accounts (NA), is problematic because expenditure on certain items are often misreported, particularly items such as alcohol and tobacco (<a href=\"#bib13\">Atkinson and Micklewright, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Banks and Johnson, 1997</a>), and because there are substantial definitional differences across HBS and NA categories. In principal, simulated totals can be reweighted to reflect official aggregates. This however requires the assumption that the misreporting and other sources of differences between simulated and official aggregates, due to differences in survey weights used, and uprating and imputation techniques (<a href=\"#bib82\">Immervoll and O\u2019Donoghue, 2009</a>), are distributed equally across households. In the case of expenditure data, if reweighting is applied to each expenditure item and some households are more likely to misreport than others are, this may introduce additional bias in the structure of households\u2019 budget. Reweighting should be used with caution as it can substantially alter simulation outcomes (<a href=\"#bib122\">Myck and Najsztub, 2014</a>).",

To understand this result, we must consider the inflation rates of different goods, the own-price elasticities of different goods and the composition of the consumption basket along the expenditure distribution. High inflation rates are recorded for food and transport, which have relatively high own-price elasticities. Food budget shares are substantially higher than transport budget shares. Further, food budget shares are substantially higher for low-expenditure households than for high-expenditure households. Higher food budget shares, paired with high food inflation and large differences in food budget shares between low-and high-expenditure households lead to larger behavioural responses among low-expenditure households than high-expenditure households.

The biggest driver of the welfare loss at the bottom was food price inflation, which comprises over half the budget share, while other goods and services were the biggest driver at the top of the distribution. The distributional impact of inflation in other goods and services, paired with the impact of motor fuel inflation, outweighs the distributional impact of food inflation, so that the overall distributional impact of inflation is mildly progressive.",

Using these theories and specialized surveys, the approach is to estimate discrete choice models for each technology and to adjust the energy use of households as a function of the technology used. By complementing the PRICES model with modules accounting for employment changes and for household innovation adoption, the PRICES model will be able to further account for important drivers of the distributional impact of price changes, essential in evaluating the success of a just transition to low carbon economies and in guiding policymakers in their response to price shocks.",
