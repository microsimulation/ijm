                "text": "This article uses microsimulation analysis to estimate that the net cost (the real cost) of a roughly poverty-level Universal Basic Income (UBI) for the United Kingdom is about \u00a345 billion per year or 2% of GDP. We use 2019/2020 fiscal year data to examine a scheme with a UBI of \u00a38,040 for adults and \u00a34,020 for children with a marginal tax rate of 50% on net beneficiaries. This UBI scheme adds only 25% to the cost of the UK\u2019s existing transfer system and only 5.1% to total UK government spending. About 54% of UK families would benefit from the transition to this UBI scheme, with the average gain for each net-beneficiary family being \u00a33,025. The \u00a345 billion figure is a \u201cnet\u201d cost in two senses. First, it subtracts the amount of UBI that individuals pay themselves as they simultaneously receive UBI and pay higher taxes to finance it. This calculation alone shows that the cost of UBI is only about one-third of the often-quoted-but-not-very-useful concept of \u201cgross cost,\u201d which ignores the fact that it costs nothing for a person to give themselves a pound; neither does giving oneself a pound affect any marginal cost or benefits faced by any person\u2019s budget constraint. Second, this article also adds and subtracts the costs and savings involved in integrating the UBI scheme into the UK\u2019s existing tax and benefit system. This calculation further reduces the scheme\u2019s cost to 10% of gross cost. Under this scheme, the percent of UK families with incomes below the current official poverty line would drop by 72% from 17.9% to 5.0%. The largest increase in incomes would be felt by those most deeply in poverty, so that deep poverty, poverty among children, and poverty among the elderly would all but disappear.",

Instead, by using micro-data at the individual level from the UK\u2019s Family Resource Survey, and defining an appropriate measure for the costs, we are able to estimate required funding for such an illustrative UBI scheme, showing that this roughly poverty-level UBI is both affordable in principle and capable of producing many of the results claimed by supporters.",

In his example, current government spending on social security, which he estimates at one third of total government spending, would be completely abolished. This leads to a tax rate in his example of two-thirds of current taxes plus an additional income tax rate of 50%. He concludes that such a high tax rate would probably be untenable. However, his calculation greatly overstates his case by disregarding the amount of taxes citizens essentially pay to themselves in the form of UBI.

The socio-economic data is usually collected at the individual or household level from national surveys such as <i>the Family Resource Survey</i> in the UK or the EU\u2019s <i>Statistics on Income and Living Conditions</i>. By calibrating the model with observed transfer payments from the data, TBMs can accurately estimate the relevant taxes and benefits in a given year. In a second step, such a calibrated TBM can then be used to investigate the effects of changing individual policy rules like tax rates, benefit levels or allowances using the same set of micro-data as for the calibration.

This means that some beneficiaries will experience an effective rate in excess of 85% over a small range of income. We recommend reducing the rate at which means-tested benefits taper off, even folding them into our 50% rate. Unfortunately, data limitations and the complexity of the existing Housing Benefit system don\u2019t allow us to make this calculation. Fixing this problem would increase the overall cost of the program, but not by very much, because the number of people affected is moderate and the high rate occurs over a small range of income.",

This article does not address that question: it focuses exclusively on the question <i>how much does UBI cost</i>, leaving the question <i>how can or should the UK finance that cost</i> for future research. We said above that the net cost of UBI is affected by the fact that nearly everyone both receives UBI and pays at least some taxes. To determine how much UBI costs, we need to calculate the difference between how much net beneficiaries pay in taxes and how much they receive in UBI, and so we have specified the marginal tax rate for net beneficiaries. But we do not need to know how much net contributors pay and receive in UBI, and so we do not need to specify the tax rate for net contributors. We know that they paid enough income taxes at the 50% rate to equal their UBI, but we do not need to know (for the purpose of determining how much UBI costs) whether they continue to pay at the 50% rate, whether it is higher or lower, whether their taxes are levied on some base other than income (such as wealth, resource-ownership, pollution, inheritance, and so on).",

The inability of UBI schemes to directly replace housing benefits is a topic which is recognised by many authors (e.g. <a href=\"#bib16\">Kela, 2016, p. <span class=\"page-number\">12</span></a>; or <a href=\"#bib19\">Miller, 2017, pp. <span class=\"page-number\">90-91</span></a>).

For the illustrative purposes of this paper, we abolish contributory programs, mostly because there is less need for them under our scheme: contributory social security programs are explicitly intended to alleviate the cost of MTBs in requiring able individuals to insure themselves from adverse events like unemployment or old age (<a href=\"#bib11\">Goodin, 1992</a>). Pension schemes can especially help mitigate time-inconsistent saving preferences,<a href=\"#fn14\"><sup>14</sup></a> or serve as a politically feasible redistribution program (e.g. <a href=\"#bib6\">Cremer and Pestieau, 2011</a>).

Poverty is correlated with ill health, accidents, crime, violence, low education, and many other problems all of which generate enormous costs for society. Children who grow up in poverty suffer long-term negative effects that are costly for them and for society as a whole for the rest of their lives. Research shows that reducing poverty with cash transfers can have positive effects on these and many other problems with the potential that a UBI scheme like this one could save enormous amounts of money over time, maybe shifting the cost-benefit analysis dramatically (<a href=\"#bib10\">Forget, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lewis, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Pereira, 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Widerquist and Lewis, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009</a>).",

Given that this definition of the poverty line changes with median income, the official poverty line after the introduction of our UBI scheme would increase and official poverty would decrease by less than stated above. That is, we defined our scheme in a way that makes roughly 54% of the country net beneficiaries. Therefore, it will increase the median income, which in turn will increase the official poverty line. Our calculations suggest that the relative poverty line will increase by roughly 16%.",
