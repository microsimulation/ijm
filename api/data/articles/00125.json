Concern for the distributive impacts of macroeconomic policies in developing countries has been increasing in recent years. Policy debates have focused progressively more on inclusive, or pro-poor, growth and, more broadly, economic and human development through the Millenium Development Goals (2000\u20132015) and, more recently, the Sustainable Development Goals (2016\u20132030). In this context, the marriage of computable general equilibrium (CGE) and microsimulation models has become a dynamic area of policy research throughout the developing world.",

Quite interestingly, he finds that both approaches are consistent with the data, supporting the view that the importance attributed by and large in the economic profession to behavioural responses might be, at least for some applications, overstated. Obviously, whether this is the case or not can be evaluated only ex-post, after having allowed for the more complex feedbacks in the model. Other recent CGE-microsimulation papers also appeared in <i>Economic Modelling</i> are <a href=\"#bib8\">Verikios and Zhang (2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2015</a>) and <a href=\"#bib1\">Breisinger and Ecker (2014)</a>.",

Genomics is an emerging field of clinical medicine which moves from the old paradigm of aggregation of diseases into large groups such as cardiovascular disease, often defined as headline disease groups or national health priority areas. This aggregate approach to medicine is rapidly being redefined as our growing understanding of the human genome proves that these large disease groups are, in fact, made up of many much rarer conditions. The field of genomics and personalised medicine will revolutionise modern medicine (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dzau <i>et al</i>, 2015</a>). It also calls for a form of modelling that can capture individual genetic differences and response to therapy \u2013 a purpose to which microsimulation is eminently suited. Conversely, the risk of using aggregate models of grouped diseases with crude averaged impacts as inputs can produce highly erroneous results, further confounded if based on assumptions rather than the quality of data microsimulation models typically reply upon (<a href=\"#bib5\">Doble <i>et al</i>., 2015</a>).",
