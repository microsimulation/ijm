                "text": "This paper explores the within and between country distributional implications of an illustrative Child Basic Income (CBI) operated at EU level. Using EUROMOD, we establish that a universal payment of \u20ac50 per month per child aged under 6 could take 800,000 children in this age group out of poverty. It could be financed by an EU flat tax of 0.2% on all household income, assuming that it would also be taxed nationally as income. Most member states and virtually all families with children aged under 6 would be net gainers. We simulate two versions of EU CBI, with the benefit rate of \u20ac50 per month adjusted or not for differences in purchasing power between member states. In general, fiscal flows between member states, and also poverty reduction, would be smaller under the adjusted version. The political feasibility of such a scheme might be questioned, especially within the net contributor countries. Nevertheless, for those seeking ways to strengthen solidarity across national boundaries, a scheme supporting the incomes of families with young children, wherever in the EU they might reside \u201ccould be a demonstration of the EU\u2019s commitment to children, to the future\u201d (<a href=\"#bib5\">EC 2012a</a>: 62).",

To address that charge, we have limited eligibility for the EU Child Basic Income to children aged under 6. In addition to fiscal concerns, the narrow age focus might also be justified by the innovative character of the policy, which requires some caution. Moreover, as is standard practice with child benefits in Britain and elsewhere, the EU Child Basic Income simulated here is paid to the mother. Also, crucially, it is assumed to be taxed as income \u2013 again, as is standard practice with universal benefits, e.g. in Scandinavia. Since it is paid to the mother it is assumed to be taxed as her income. While national taxation would \u201cclaw back\u201d some of the fiscal spending on the scheme, its net cost would remain considerable. In view of that, and in line with <a href=\"#bib2\">Atkinson (1995)</a>, we have assumed that the scheme would be funded out of a flat tax on all incomes, at a common rate set exactly to offset its net cost at EU level.

To the extent that these are also countries already with substantial provision for children (Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark) this might erode support for an EU CBI.
