The microsimulation, based on a household income generation model, allows for incorporating individual fixed effects into macro-micro analysis. We argue that one of the main merits of the sequential approach is its flexibility. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of theoretical inconsistency.",

It is clear that this poses a formidable task, which of course raises the question of the appropriate methodology to address such questions.

Yet, recent empirical findings on distributional change indicate that changes within household groups distributions account for an important share of overall distributional change (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bourguignon <i>et al</i>., 2005b</a>). At first sight, an obvious solution to this problem seems to increase the number of household groups, or even to incorporate all households from representative household surveys into the CGE model. Similarly \u2013 yet without providing heterogeneous feedback into the CGE model \u2013 micro-accounting techniques on the basis of household survey data that apply changes in factor prices at the individual level using household survey-data could be used to increase household heterogeneity. In an assessment of Russia\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), <a href=\"#bib14\">Harrison <i>et al</i>.

It merely shows that even full heterogeneity of households in terms of factor endowments and consumption patterns does not make a difference in a standard CGE model. Microeconomic evidence on the drivers of changes in income distributions however suggests that applied CGE models (including those combined with household-survey-based micro-accounting models) may fail for a different reason: The importance of individual heterogeneity and decisions taken at the individual level for distributional and poverty outcomes; in other words, the importance of \u201cindividual behavior\u201d. On the labor market, individual decisions include entry into the labor market, falling into unemployment or switching between sectors or occupations. Of course, CGE models can be extended to include for example unemployment and/or endogenous labor supply. Yet, in order to capture the income distribution implications, decisions would have to taken by \u201creal\u201d individual household members. This implies to introduce individual \u201cfixed effects\u201d and eventually requires the estimation of structural labor market models (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bourguignon <i>et al</i>., 2005a</a>) that would need to be integrated in a general equilibrium framework. The estimation of such structural labor market models is by no means a trivial exercise and embedding them into a general equilibrium framework an additional challenge.<a href=\"#fn2\"><sup>2</sup></a>",

The sequential macro-micro approach that links a macroeconomic model, for example an applied CGE model, to a behavioural microsimulation model has two distinguishing features. First, it is sequential. A counterfactual scenario is generated in the macro (CGE) model. Then specific poverty and distribution-relevant link variables, for example wages and employment, are passed to a microsimulation model. Second, the microsimulation has behavioural components. For the microsimulation, individual and household decisions are modeled using microeconometric techniques on household and employment survey data. Through the microsimulation, the combined model hence incorporates individual \u201cfixed effects\u201d into the analysis.",

These variables, which we label \u201clink variables\u201d, are prices and quantities on factor and goods markets. Link variables from factor markets include real wages for different types of labor, returns to land and different types of capital. Factor quantities, for example the sectoral composition of labor, may also be passed from a macro model to a microsimulation. Finally, goods prices and quantities may operate as link variables. The developing country applications presented in this paper use applied trade-focused CGE models.<a href=\"#fn3\"><sup>3</sup></a> Yet, other types of macro models with very different foci and features, including other forms of general equilibrium models (real business cycle models, and stochastic dynamic general equilibrium models) and macroeconometric models, may be more suitable in different contexts and for different questions.

This scenario is also most interesting from a methodological viewpoint, as it highlights the benefits of a behavioural microsimulation. Under full liberalization, the rural poor benefit more than proportionately, a result driven \u2013 on the macro level \u2013 by an export boom in agriculture and agricultural processing industries, growing labor demand and associated higher wages. However, following full liberalization, a larger number of workers remain in agriculture compared to the baseline scenario. Given that moving out of agriculture may substantially improve the income situation of a household, one may expect full liberalization to weaken poverty reduction, an expectation supported by the observation that moving households are on average poorer than those remaining in agriculture (for example because they are landless). However, this is not the case, as the gain in agricultural incomes more than compensates the reduced benefits from lower migration flows (for example because they are better educated than those who stay in agriculture).",

These results can be rationalized by looking at, first, who moves into informality and, second, the size of the income loss for movers relative to both their initial income and the income losses incurred by other individuals. The size of the income loss depends on individual characteristics (as the returns to these characteristics differ between formal and informal activities) and on whether an individual joins an already existing household enterprise or establishes a new one. The estimation, which underlies the microsimulation, shows that less educated younger (and hence poorer) individuals tend to move into informality first. With regard to the size of the income losses, the estimation results for wages and profit functions indicate that the income loss of moving into informality is higher for more educated individuals, at least in absolute terms, when they move into an existing household enterprise. However, it may also happen that establishing an informal enterprise increases earnings for a skilled individual \u2013 conditional of course on other individual characteristics.

Estimating earnings equations that correspond to different sectoral or occupational choices entail selection problems.

This selection on unobservables biases the coefficients of an Ordinary Least Squares estimation of the respective equations and would have to be accounted for. It is not trivial to correct for selectivity bias, although the so-called Heckman correction or one of its variants is very common in applied work.
