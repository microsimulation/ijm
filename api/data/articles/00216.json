In this article, we calculate confidence intervals for a large tax microsimulation model, comparing a normal approximation to a bootstrap estimator. We estimate confidence intervals for five proposed changes to tax law. We explore the relationship between the size of proposals\u2019 point-estimated impacts and their confidence intervals by considering high, central, and low scenarios for three proposals. To explore uncertainty around small-magnitude estimates, we consider a proposal designed to keep tax revenue unchanged. Finally, we consider a proposal that affects a small number of taxpayers but has a large heterogeneous effect. We find that, overall, confidence intervals in the model fit tightly around the point estimates, but there are exceptions. We also find that in many cases the normal approximation is close to the bootstrap estimator but may differ for policy changes that affect a small number of taxpayers.",

Further, researchers could learn how various assumptions and parameters affect the model\u2019s outcomes by recalculating the results under different assumptions and parameters. The benefit of this approach to study government policies was clear: by altering model parameters, the difference in outcomes attributable to different policy choices could be measured. Importantly, uncertainty could be estimated by repeatedly running the model on random subsamples and calculating standard errors and confidence intervals.",

Yet if the estimates are not significantly different in a statistical sense, the policy change may not be progressive if applied to the population.

We also rely on a fundamental insight that may have escaped prior researchers: resampling does not require recalculating taxes for each draw. Instead, in each resample the weights are adjusted and applied to the original sample of tax units. These resamples\u2019 weights only need to be produced once and can be used to compute confidence intervals for point estimates of any policy proposal. We also calculate confidence intervals using a normal approximation and compare the results to our bootstrapped intervals. To this end, we estimate five potential changes in tax policy. For (i) a partial restoration of the personal exemption, (ii) an increase in the standard deduction, and (iii) an increase in the top marginal tax rate, we estimate the effects of high, central, and low scenarios. In addition, we consider a revenue-neutral proposal to replace the current-law farm loss deduction with a refundable tax credit based on the total farm loss that should create confidence intervals around point estimates of zero dollar for the average change in tax burden. Finally, we examine a rescission of the tax-free treatment of interest accruing from certain government bonds that should only affect a small group of heterogeneous tax units.",

First, in most cases the standard errors of the estimated change in taxes for most income groups are small and the 95 percent confidence intervals fit tightly around the point estimates. This means that differences across income groups are statistically significant and, if the same holds true for other tax models, economically meaningful differences among models are also statistically significant. Further, the normal approximation are quite close to the bootstrapped estimates. Second, for the policy alternatives that have high, central and low scenarios, the scenarios leading to larger effects also lead to wider confidence intervals. Finally, when reform only affects a small number of tax units, the average change in taxes may be estimated imprecisely. In these cases, it may be difficult to determine if a proposed policy change is progressive or regressive. In addition, the normal approximation to a confidence interval may differ from the bootstrapped version.",

We chose these policy proposals because point estimates should be relatively more uncertain when proposals affect fewer, more diverse tax units. In addition, to allow for confidence intervals to vary with the point estimates, we also varied the relevant parameters of the first three proposals to three levels: high, central and low scenarios.

For (ii), a tax reduction for a full $4,000 per person exemption reduces tax by only $480 for a single tax unit with no dependents in the 12 percent tax bracket but $1,280 for a similar tax unit in the 32 percent bracket. For (iii), low income tax units whose taxable income is less than the available exemptions under the proposal ($4,000 multiplied by the number of personal exemptions) will only be able to claim an exemption amount up to their taxable income while high income tax units may face a phase-out and can only use part or none of the available exemptions.",

The results for all income groups are available in the online appendix. Because ECI accounts for components of income that are not part of AGI and tax proposals generally depend on AGI, a proposal may affect tax units in an ECI group that at first glance seems counterintuitive.

In contrast, the smaller benefit for high-income tax units -- even with the large average tax rate -- occurs because some of them are in the phase-out range.

In this article, we use a bootstrap technique to estimate the sampling variation from TPC\u2019s microsimulation model of the U.S. individual income tax system. The bootstrapped exercises show that point estimates produced by the model are generally very precise. This supports the standard practice of not reporting associated standard errors and confidence intervals of point estimates. However, there are exceptions, and the methodology demonstrated in this paper can be used to address uncertainties of the point estimates, with the goal of providing adequate information for better policy formation.",
