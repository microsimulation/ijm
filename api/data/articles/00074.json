Research findings based for the first time on EUROMOD covering all 27 European Member States are presented. Furthermore, the issue looks at the importance and implications of choosing a certain input data for microsimulation and at the solutions of different data issues. Finally, analysis on the redistributive policy effects and work incentives is presented based on EUROMOD spin-off models for Russia and Serbia.",

The EU wide coverage, its user friendliness and the open accessibility make of EUROMOD a valuable research infrastructure at the disposal of academics and policy makers, as shown by its recent applications reviewed in the paper. The plans to overcome the current limitations and further developments pose some important challenges and show the vitality of the EUROMOD community.",

One of the key ingredients in this process is the reliability of the input data as shown by Lidia Ceriani, Carlo V. Fiorio and Chiara Gigliarano. They explore the pros and cons of alternative data sets for static tax-benefit microsimulation in Italy. In their analysis, they highlight the importance of the treatment of tax evasion and matching of different input data, which can improve the quality of the simulations with lessons that can be useful for other countries as well.",
