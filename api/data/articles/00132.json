In the run-up of the implementation of a specific reform proposal, it is crucial to predict the expected consequences on individuals (gains and losses, income distribution), the government budget and key economic indicators (e.g. employment, prices, consumption) to provide policymakers with well-founded decision guidance. The complexity of existing welfare states requires the usage of simplified models for the evaluation of reform proposals. Only simulation models can provide information for an ex-ante analysis of different reform proposals. Other than in the natural sciences, it is seldom possible in economics to use experiments for the analysis of a given treatment (policy). Policy simulations can be interpreted as quasi-experiments which allow the economist to ex-ante analyze a reform proposal before its implementation in real life controlling for behavioral responses of different agents in the economy.",

A linked model can provide a more powerful tool for policy analysis than using results from two stand-alone models (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson 1990</a>). Outputs from the macro model can be used to align the predictions of the micro model and to enable general equilibrium feedbacks and interactions among variables in the micro model. Outputs from the micro model can be used to calibrate the macro model and provide a microeconomic basis for aggregate behavior. Hence, the key advantage of a linked micro macro model is the feedback which is used to resolve the model corresponding to a revised set of parameters. This in turn will then enable to analyze the complex interdependence of various policy measures with respect to fiscal, distributional, employment and growth effects within the same econometric framework. However, achieving these feedback effects through linking MS and CGE models is not a trivial task.",

The first approach requires the complete micro model to be included in the CGE model which demands high standards for the database and the construction of the integrated model. The second approach can be differentiated into a top-down, a bottom-up, and a top-down-bottom-up approach. The top-down approach computes the macroeconomic variables (price level, growth rates) in a CGE model as input for the micro model which is adjusted to match an exogenous macro aggregate. The bottom-up approach works the other way around and information from the micro model (elasticities, tax rates) is used in the macro model (e.g. to calibrate the representative agents). Both approaches suffer from the drawback that not all feedback is used. The top-down bottom-up approach combines both methods to a recursive approach. In an iterative process one model is solved, information is sent to the other model, which is solved and gives feedback to the first model. This iterative process continues until the two models converge.",

On the one hand, information from the MS model is aggregated to calibrate the representative agent(s) of the CGE model. Typical variables and parameters used in this bottom-up linkage include labor supply elasticities, income components, average and marginal tax rates, consumption patterns, income levels and tax revenues. On the other hand, information from the CGE model is given to the MS model. For the top-down linkage, changes of the wage or price level are used to adjust the (real) disposable incomes and consumption levels for the labor supply estimations. When linking the two levels, it has to be assured that the individual functions from the micro model can be aggregated to macro level functions and the macro level information disaggregated to the micro level in a consistent way. For example, a (nested) multinominal logit specification of the individual direct utility function (which is usually used in discrete choice labor supply models) can be aggregated to a global CES utility function (which is usually used in CGE models, see, e.g., <a href=\"#bib25\">Verboven (1996)</a>). If the top-down bottom-up approach is used, convergence criteria for the end of the iteration process have to be defined. Convergence is typically achieved when the changes in the exchange variables are (close to) zero. However, there is no (theoretical) guarantee that both models converge.",

Especially functional forms (e.g. the preference functions in the labor supply model and the aggregated utility in the CGE model) have to be specified in a consistent way.<sup><a href=\"#fn6\">6</a></sup> To be able to successfully link MS and CGE models there have to be some common variables through which the two models can exchange information. Usually, it is necessary to aggregate or disaggregate these variables to be comparable with the variables in the other model. Of course, the less variables have to be (dis)aggregated the more of the underlying heterogeneity in the data will be retained. Furthermore, it has to be checked if the same variable in both models represents the same population (e.g. household consumption in the micro model vs. aggregated total consumption including government in the macro model). In addition, it has to be checked if one run of each model represents the same time horizon.
