Two scenarios (complete tariff cut and uniform tariff scheme) suggest that further liberalization of trade has a negative short-run effect on the overall economy. We find that the agriculture-based manufacturing sector (in particular, textile and leather) is likely to be strongly affected by tariff reductions. Poverty estimates show an increase in both scenarios. At the national level, complete tariff cut increases poverty by 2.8%, compared to 2.3% under a uniform tariff scheme. In both scenarios, poverty increases more among entrepreneur households (3.2% in the uniform tariff cut scenario), than farm and wage earner households (0.9% and 1.5%, respectively). This is consistent with the theoretical argument that previously-protected infant industries are highly affected by trade liberalization and may require compensatory policies.",

Using a CGE model with a dualistic economy (urban and rural sector labor forces) and real wage differentials, Gelan considers three simulations: a 50% nominal devaluation of the Ethiopian currency, a 50% reduction of imported tariffs, and a 50% reduction of export taxes. The results suggest that impacts of trade liberalization depend on wage-setting conditions in urban areas. With a fixed urban real wage, the trade reform adversely affects overall economic growth, while both rural and urban areas experience an expansion in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with a flexible urban nominal wage. A nominal devaluation combined with a reduction in external trade tariffs would not enhance the structural transformation of the economy.

The analysis shows that tariff dismantling has both negative and positive effects on the economy. The main negative effect is a reduction of government fiscal revenues, while the likely positive effects include an increase in foreign investment and the stimulation of domestic demand that could result in greater economic growth due to an increase in household purchasing power. In the same year, a study by <a href=\"#bib16\">Geda and Shimeles (2005)</a> explored the changes in tax structure over time and the distributional impacts of tax reform in Ethiopia.

The study attributes more than half of the national poverty reduction from 1988 to 1995 to the tariff reforms.

A distinctive feature of Ethiopia\u2019s exports is that, being mainly agricultural commodities, they are vulnerable to weather conditions and adverse terms-of-trade shocks. Moreover, the traditional way of producing exportable items negatively influences the quality of these commodities and, consequently, prices in international markets.",

The neo-classical assumptions of CGE models, such as perfect competition, are unrealistic and the role of money in the economy is missing in many models. In addition, these models require refined and enormous datasets and rely on elasticity that can be sometimes difficult to find and/or approximate. We attempt to overcome some of these limitations by using available data and taking elasticity calculated by Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) for Ethiopia to get an approximation. In addition, elasticity values, which are not included in the SAM, are taken from other published studies that analyze countries with an economy structure similar to that of Ethiopia. For example, some elasticity are taken from <a href=\"#bib1\">Annabi <i>et al</i>. (2005)</a> who analyze the link between trade liberalization, growth and poverty in Senegal and <a href=\"#bib7\">Chitiga <i>et al</i>. (2007)</a>, who analyze impact of tariff removal on poverty in Zimbabwe. Given that both studies analyze similar topics with our study and the countries are found at more or less similar economic status, being a member of Sub-Saharan African countries, justifies the use of elasticities from these studies. Finally, we note that CGE models assume that equilibrium exists in the base year and compare the baseline with the results after some policy shock.",

The second scenario is a more realistic uniform tariff scheme, where all tariffs are brought to the lowest non-zero tariff rate in Ethiopia (7.3%). For this study, we use direct taxes to compensate for the loss in government tariff revenue after liberalization. This is the general practice in public finance and reflects the fact that many countries increase direct taxation when removing import taxes. The compensatory tax is introduced in such a way that the decline in government revenue due to the tariff cut is fully compensated, while the same amount is deducted from household disposable income.",

We expect the tariff reduction and/or removal to directly affect these sectors by the fall in price of imports. Looking at the sectoral shares of imports and exports in total output at the base year is crucial to understand the likely effect of tariff cut on these sectors (<a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>). Cash crops such as coffee, <i>Khat</i>, pulses and oil seeds; textile and leather; and mining exhibit high export to output ratio. For instance, coffee alone accounts for about two-thirds of total exports. Other primary exports include minerals. This confirms that primary products dominate export earnings in Ethiopia. Trade, transport and communication are also other sources of export earnings, with Ethiopian airlines dominating the transport export. Regarding imports, textile, leather, and other manufacturing have relatively higher imported input to total input use ratio. For example, in 2010, the ratio of imported inputs to total input used was 51% for manufacturing sector (<a href=\"#bib10\">CSA, 2011</a>), which shows a relatively high degree of import dependence of the sector.",

As expected, imports increase for sectors with initially higher tariff rates. The increase in the volume of imports can be explained in terms of a fall in import prices following a policy of tariff reduction or elimination. In particular, a 100% tariff cut is likely to lead to a substantial reduction in prices of imports of textiles, leather, processed food, and beverages. Sectors such as textile and leather and food processing had previously high protection. After the full tariff removal, imports of textile and leather increase by 20.9% and food processing imports increase by 8.31%. For the uniform tariff scheme, imports of these sectors also increase, although at a lower rate (17.8% for the textile and leather and by 6.21% for food processing). Imports of the sub-sector \u2018other manufacturing\u2019 increase only slightly in the complete tariff removal scenario, while it decreases for the uniform tariff scheme scenario, in both cases; the change is by less than 1%.",

Farm households, which represent more than 80% of the Ethiopian population, face a decline in consumption under both scenarios, while consumption of wage earners and entrepreneur households increases slightly. This is due to the varying degree of reliance of the different household groups on the various sectors. At the same time, the simulation results show that consumer prices increase for all household categories. Notably, the increase in the consumer prices is greater than that of nominal income, which implies that real consumption and welfare (as measured by equivalent variations) decline for all household groups.

Furthermore, trade liberalization reduces the demand for both locally produced textile/leather and food/beverage goods, thus shrinking the demand for labor in these industries, while having only a limited impact on the other manufacturing sectors and on the agricultural sector. This implies that, in the short run, trade liberalization has an adverse net effect on the macro-economy and welfare of households. This is especially true in a developing economy like Ethiopia, which is predominantly characterized by subsistence production, a weak and small industrial sector, weak inter-sectoral links, and high transaction costs. Moreover, inability of the agricultural sector (which employs about 85% of the country\u2019s population) to take advantage of trade opportunities contributes to these adverse poverty effects.",

In addition, the prevalence of structural rigidities in an economy is likely to dampen the effects of price-based reforms (such as trade liberalization) and to limit the use of standard economy-wide models (such as conventional CGE) in explaining the impact of unilateral trade liberalization on poverty in developing countries.
