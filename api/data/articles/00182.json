This heuristic, which we call <i>Take the Weighted Average with the Next Desiring Date</i>, is a plausible search rule in terms of informational assumptions. Our simulations show that this new heuristic is in terms of mating likelihood almost as good as, and in terms of mating speed always better than, the most successful \u2014yet also unrealistic\u2014 heuristic of <a href=\"#bib10\">Todd and Miller (1999)</a>, namely the Mate Value-5 rule, which assumes that individuals in the mating population completely know their own mate values before interacting with any date. The success of our heuristic stems from its extreme power to lead an average individual in the mating population to always underestimate his/her own mate value during the adolescence (learning) phase of the mating process. While our new heuristic is also found to be successfully egalitarian in pairing up individuals, it does not perform well in terms of marital stability.",

This model involves two phases, the first of which is called the adolescence phase. Individuals who have homogeneous preferences over the individuals of the opposite sex randomly interact with a number of dates sequentially in this phase and inform each of their dates regarding whether he/she was found desirable. Using these feedbacks, individuals adjust their aspiration levels after every interaction according to some rule used by the whole population. In the second phase, called the mating phase, individuals randomly interact with potential mates and decide to whom to make a proposal. At each stage of this phase, every pair of individuals are removed from the mating pool as a married couple if they have simultaneously proposed to each other. The mating phase ends after a stage at which either the mating pool contains no individuals or no pair of individuals inside the mating pool can form a married couple.",

According to Take the Next Best, each individual has an initial aspiration level of zero and after each instance of dating sets his/her aspiration to the mate value of his/her date provided that this date is desirable; that is, the mate value of this date exceeds his/her previous aspiration level. Under Mate Value-5, each individual always sets his/her aspiration level to a constant value that is lower than his/her own mate value by the value of 5. The other three adjustment rules set the initial aspiration level of each individual to the average mate value. Of these rules, Adjust Up/Down requires that each individual adjusts at each instance of dating his/her aspiration upwards (downwards) by a constant parameter if he/she is found by his/her date desirable (non-desirable). The Adjust Relative Rule is a modification of Adjust Up/Down with mutual desirability taking the place of desirability. Under this rule, an individual raises (reduces) his/her aspiration level by a constant parameter, if he/she and his/her date find each other desirable (non-desirable). In other possible cases, individuals make no adjustments. Finally, the rule of Adjust Relative/2 is similar to Adjust Relative with the difference that for each individual the adjustment parameter at any instance of dating is equal to the half of the difference between his/her previous aspiration level and the mate value of his/her present date.",

In addition, with respect to a notion of mating stability that is measured by the mean within-pair difference in mate value, mated pairs formed always become more stable under Mate Value-5 than under Adjust Up/Down, Adjust Relative, and Adjust Relative/2. In fact, Mate Value-5 also performs better than Take the Next Best when the adolescence length is short to medium. Overall, Mate Value-5 becomes the best search rule both in pairing up a great proportion of the population and in pairing up individuals with almost identical mate values. But, unfortunately, this rule has a very serious problem. It is based on the unrealistic assumption that each individual enters the adolescence phase of mate search by already knowing his/her own mate value, while one should be aware of the fact that:",

Of these rules, Adjust Relative/2 becomes superior to the other realistic rules of <a href=\"#bib10\">Todd and Miller (1999)</a> with respect to a success measure that appropriately balances the likelihood and stability of matings. However, if the individual performances of Adjust Relative/2 and Mate Value-5 are compared, one can see, irrespective of the adolescence length, around a two-fold difference between the mating likelihoods generated by these two search rules always in favor of Mate Value-5. Clearly, Adjust Relative/2, which is plausible as a rule, is not a successful alternative to the unrealistic rule of Mate Value-5. This brings us to the following question: Can we find a heuristic that is plausible and that is almost as successful as Mate Value-5 in terms of likelihood of mating? The answer we provide in this paper is \u2018yes\u2019. We introduce a realistic heuristic, which we call <i>Take the Weighted Average with the Next Desiring Date</i>, yielding almost as high likelihood of mating as Mate Value-5, especially when the adolescence length is long.",

Two recent related works in this literature are <a href=\"#bib8\">Shiba (2013)</a> and <a href=\"#bib7\">Saglam (2014)</a>. <a href=\"#bib8\">Shiba (2013)</a> extends the symmetric two-sided sequential mate search model of <a href=\"#bib10\">Todd and Miller (1999)</a> to an asymmetric case (of firm or job with worker matching), and evaluates how the mating outcome changes when the two sides of the mating population use different adjustment rules (with one of the sides, the firms, using Mate Value-5 and the other side, the workers, using Adjust Relative/2). Findings of this study involve that the likelihood and stability of mating are similar under the symmetric and asymmetric cases, while the average value of successful individuals (workers) are higher under the asymmetric case, pointing to the failure of individuals with relatively low values in finding mates (jobs). <a href=\"#bib7\">Saglam (2014)</a> studies a similar robustness problem regarding whether any search rule of <a href=\"#bib10\">Todd and Miller (1999)</a> can be used as a <a href=\"#bib6\">Nash (1950)</a> equilibrium strategy by the whole population so that no individual would have an incentive to unilaterally deviate from that search rule to any other rule so as to increase the likelihood of his/her mating.

This is because that under this rule aspirations become so high that individuals with low or medium mate values are not likely to end up in a mutually agreeable (desirable) mating. Evidently, the most \u2018balanced\u2019 search strategy is Mate Value-5, which generates a mean mate value around 50 for all adolescence lengths. This result is not surprising given the power of Mate Value-5 in pairing up individuals. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> also shows that individuals who find mates are essentially the top half of the population under Adjust Relative and the bottom half of the population under Adjust Up/Down. Whenever Mate Value-5 is left aside, the most successfully egalitarian (balanced) search strategy becomes Adjust Relative/2, especially when the adolescence length is medium to long.",

Although Take the Next Best is the worst rule with respect to the stability measure for very low adolescence lengths, it becomes at least as good as Mate Value-5 and always dominates the other three rules when the adolescence length is not very short. Over the same range of adolescence lengths, it is also found that Adjust Relative/2 is always superior to Adjust Up/Down, the latter of which on the other hand is always superior to Adjust Relative.",

The exception with Take the Next Best is due to the fact that under this rule the aspiration of each individual quickly converges towards the highest mate value in the population. Hence, under this rule most individuals extremely overestimate themselves in the adolescence phase. This implies that in the mating phase only a tiny fraction of the population becomes able to find mates, while this tiny fraction involves only some elite members of the mating population who make almost no estimation errors. This is because these elite members have extremely high mate values and interacting with a desirable date is therefore very unlikely for them. Consequently, the mean within pair-difference in mate value becomes very low under the Take the Next Best Rule.",

Regarding our first object, we have calculated, for each heuristic of <a href=\"#bib10\">Todd and Miller (1999)</a>, the Root Mean Square Error made by all individuals in the mating population in estimating their own mate values in the adolescence phase of the mating process. We have found that the estimation errors attain their lowest values under Mate Value-5, while they are in general lower under Adjust Relative/2 than under the other realistic rules, namely Take the Next Best, Adjust Up/Down, and Adjust Relative. In addition, the estimation errors under Adjust Relative/2 are as low as they are under the unrealistic rule of Mate Value-5 when the adolescence length is medium to long. This is quite puzzling given the huge difference between the mating likelihoods generated by these two heuristics always in favor of Mate Value-5. However, this puzzle vanishes away once we calculate the mean aspiration levels of all individuals. Whereas under Mate Value-5 the mean aspiration level is \u2014by definition\u2014 lower than the mean mate value of the population by the value of 5, it is approximately equal to the mean mate value under Adjust Relative/2. This finding indicates that the success of a heuristic may not only be related to the precision or correctness of individuals in estimating their own mate values in the adolescence phase but also to their humbleness in making their estimations.",

Our simulations using this search rule have revealed that in terms of the mating likelihood TWAND is outstandingly superior to all realistic search rules of <a href=\"#bib10\">Todd and Miller (1999)</a>, including Adjust Relative/2. Moreover, the overall performance of TWAND and the unrealistic rule of Mate Value-5 are very close. While Mate Value-5 dominates TWAND for short to medium adolescence lengths, TWAND becomes superior to Mate Value-5 when the adolescence length is long. Clearly, this is a downside of TWAND since in reality longer adolescence lengths imply higher costs \u2014for individuals seeking mates\u2014 in terms of time, effort, and/or money.",

However, TWAND has an undesirable implication as well. With respect to a notion of stability, measured by the mean within-pair difference in mate value, TWAND always performs worse than any heuristic of <a href=\"#bib10\">Todd and Miller (1999)</a>. When individuals become extremely willing to pair up with individuals whose mate values are below their own mate values, they increase not only their likelihood and speed of mating but also the likelihood that they will divorce in the future.",

We have found that RMSE for TWAND is higher than RMSE for any search rule of <a href=\"#bib10\">Todd and Miller (1999)</a>, except for Take the Next Best. This shows that the success of TWAND in terms of mating likelihood cannot be attributed to the precision of information individuals obtain about their own mate values. As we have suspected that this success is caused by the direction of estimation errors made by individuals, we have also calculated the mean aspiration levels of all individuals at the end of the adolescence phase for all search rules studied in this paper. Interestingly, we have found that the mean aspiration level of all individuals always attains its lowest value under TWAND, implying that this heuristic is even more humble than the most humble (but unrealistic) heuristic of <a href=\"#bib10\">Todd and Miller (1999)</a>, namely Mate Value-5. It is also worth noting that the humbleness of TWAND does not come up with a pre-determined constant like in the case of the Mate Value-5 rule. Instead, it comes with an endogenously determined aspiration threshold which indirectly takes the mate value (self image) of the individual into account, so that the less valuable an individual is, the less choosy he/she becomes during the mating phase. In fact, just because of this TWAND is more likely \u2014and also needs less interactions\u2014 to pair up individuals than any realistic search rule of <a href=\"#bib10\">Todd and Miller (1999)</a>.",

This assumption can be problematic because a strategy <i>a</i> which may have a worse performance than some other strategy <i>b</i> \u2014according to some success measure\u2014 when the whole mating population uses the same strategy might in fact have a better performance if it were used only by a sufficiently small part of the population while the rest of the population remained to use strategy <i>b</i>. In that case, a possibility where each individual in the mating population uses strategy <i>b</i> cannot be an equilibrium situation, since some group of individuals would have incentives to deviate from strategy <i>b</i> to strategy <i>a</i>. This particular problem of robustness was recently studied \u2014as mentioned earlier in this paper\u2014 by <a href=\"#bib7\">Saglam (2014)</a>, who investigated whether the use of any strategy of <a href=\"#bib10\">Todd and Miller (1999)</a> by the whole population can arise as a Nash equilibrium situation, where no individual has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from the strategy the rest of the population \u2014he/she believes\u2014 will use. Future research may profitably use the analysis of <a href=\"#bib7\">Saglam (2014)</a> to check whether the mate search strategy proposed in our paper, TWAND, is evolutionarily stable/robust against the mate search strategies of <a href=\"#bib10\">Todd and Miller (1999)</a>, and vice versa.",
