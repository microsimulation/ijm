It focuses on techniques and practices that have been developed to maintain Pensim2; the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) dynamic microsimulation model that simulates state and private pension entitlement. This guidance is appropriate for any type of model. Standard project management techniques and bespoke simulation model procedures are explained. This guidance is aimed at new modellers and project managers and is particularly relevant for models that are supported by a team, rather than an individual.",

Structured Release management guidance is also included in this paper",

At the end of the Development Stage, the model is released to the organisation. Shortly prior to release, the model is thoroughly validated to ensure that the results can be used with confidence. Model users analyse the model outputs in order to assess potential and future economic policies. After the model has been initially released, the model moves into the Maintenance Stage. During this stage, a model is improved and enhanced, with new releases of the model being implemented on a regular basis, with rigorous validation taking place prior to each release. Usually a new release will contain a package of changes. Models need to be continuously enhanced and maintained otherwise they quickly become out-of-date and unusable.",

As a release is built, modellers can identify whether a module they are changing has been altered by another member of the team, as different sets of changes may need to be integrated. In the example, columns are colour coded to indicate when a test version has been signed-off (green) or awaiting sign-off (yellow).

By adhering to this guidance, you will help to make your model easier to maintain and hence lengthen its life. When any system becomes overly complex, it gradually reaches the point where no-one can understand it, except its author, and hence it is no longer usable by anyone else. Well written and well maintained models can be picked up and understood by another modeller. It is recommended that this is a key aim when a model is built.",

Always create a separate change request, carry out the changes to tidy up the code and then compare the outputs before and after the changes have been applied \u2013 they should be identical. Remove redundant code and variables as the last step before a release is implemented. Again, carry out a comparison test on the outputs before and after the changes to ensure that the results are not affected. Leaving redundant code in a model causes confusion for future modellers. It is considerably quicker to remove redundant code when it becomes redundant rather than wait \u2013 future modellers will not know whether it is needed or not.",
