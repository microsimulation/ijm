We use as input data those provided by the Bank of Italy from its Survey on Households Income and Wealth, and discuss specific problems arising in the evaluation of cadastral income and of the Property Tax base. Our estimates of the distribution of taxpayers are very close to the Ministry of Finance official statistics; hence, our model can be seen as a reliable tool to evaluate the current distribution of housing taxation and the impact of potential tax reforms. Our simulations suggest that both Property Tax and Waste Management Tax show a moderate regressive impact with respect to household gross income, whilst the Personal Income Tax on dwellings other than the main residence is progressive. We then provide an application of our model, to study the Property Tax reform in 2008. Our findings show that all households owning the main residence gain from the 2008 reform, but tax cuts are mostly concentrated on the top three deciles of household equivalent gross income, so that the richest benefit most.",

For instance, from a positive perspective, questions arise in order to explain the current distribution of housing taxes and how they impact on the distribution of resources; from a normative point of view, it is important to understand how an \u2019optimal tax\u2019 on housing can be designed.",

                    "text": "The absence of almost any study on the issue of housing taxation is magnified in the case of countries where taxes have been used - together with other policies - to favour homeownership. Italy is an important case study in this respect for many reasons. Like in other Mediterranean countries (e.g., Spain), the Italian Tax Code basically exempts the figurative income from homeownership, while contemporaneously allowing for tax credits in the case of mortgage interests, creating a clear favour for owner-occupiers (e.g., <a href=\"#bib2\">Baldini, 2010</a>). These fiscal advantages for home-owners reasonably increased given the international trends in market prices, which - differently from tax bases - soared in recent years. Moreover, differently from other countries, Italy shares with the Mediterranean countries also a high number of owner-occupiers coupled with a system of public pensions particularly generous, generating a substantial redistribution in favour of the elderly (e.g., <a href=\"#bib7\">Ferrera and Castles, 1996</a>). In particular, the share of owner-occupied housing has increased strongly since 1977, reaching 72% of Italian households in the late 2000s, a figure close to that of Portugal (73%), but lower than Spain (83%); the share of owner-occupiers is instead lower in Continental European countries, like France and Germany, where these percentages amount to 58 and 46, respectively (e.g., <a href=\"#bib2\">Baldini, 2010</a>). All these redistributive issues are coupled with increasing difficulties for those who do not own their house to afford housing expenses. On the one hand, public expenditures for housing represent only a mere 0.1 percent of welfare expenditures in Italy, compared with an average 3.5 percent in the EU countries (e.g., <a href=\"#bib6\">D\u2019Alessio and Gambacorta, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Baldini, 2010</a>). On the other hand, given the increase in market values and the liberalization of rental markets occurred during the 1990s (with the removal of upper limits), also rents increased noticeably. Hence, the non-owners found it increasingly difficult to buy a house or pay a rent, a situation that could be improved also by reforming housing taxation.",

Not surprisingly, a recent reform of the Property Tax, implemented in 2008, increased even further advantages for owners, reasonably creating adverse redistributive effects in order to gain short-term political benefits. Unfortunately, the Italian government has not developed so far a model to assess the distribution of housing taxes, so that fiscal policy simulations are difficult to estimate.",

In particular, we are interested in two basic issues: first, we want to characterize the current distribution of taxes on housing, reconciling the (scant) aggregate figures on housing with those originating from micro data; second, we want to apply the microsimulation model to study the redistributive impact of fiscal reforms, and take the 2008 reform of the Property Tax as a case study. We use as input data those provided by the Bank of Italy from its Survey on Households Income and Wealth, and discuss the specific problems arising in the evaluation of the cadastral income and the Property Tax base. The model replicates fairly well the distribution of taxpayers provided by the Ministry of Finance, which makes it a reliable tool to evaluate tax reforms on housing in Italy.

Total tax revenues from housing amount to about 40 billion of euro in the late 2000s, i.e. 2.7 percent of GDP and 5.9 percent of total tax revenues (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ministry of Finance, 2008</a>). We can classify \u2018housing taxes\u2019 in two broad groups: a first group is identified by taxes on house ownership and dwelling utilization (54% of revenues); a second group considers taxes due when buying or selling, as well as restructuring a dwelling or any other kind of building (46% of revenues). Since our aim here is to develop a static microsimulation model for the analysis of housing taxation, we focus on the first group of taxes only, and limit our analysis to households, leaving aside buildings owned by (public and private) firms. The main taxes of the first group are: the Personal Income Tax (hereafter House- PIT), within which the (figurative) income from houses is taxed (about 7 billion euro); the Property Tax (hereafter ICI, from <i>Imposta Comunale sugli Immobili</i>, Municipal Tax on Buildings, about 5.2 billion euro that dropped to 2.4 billion after the 2008 ICI reform); and the Urban Waste Management Tax (hereafter TARSU, from <i>Tassa per lo Smaltimento dei Rifiuti Solidi Urbani</i>, about 3 billion euro).

Income from unoccupied or holiday homes is equal to cadastral income augmented by one third. Finally, income from rented dwellings is equal to 85 percent of the actual rent. As for the owners, from 2001 onwards the income from the <i>main residence</i> is exempted from the PIT tax base; on the contrary, income from other dwellings is included in the taxable income. Mortgage interests and maintenance expenditures allow the owner a tax credit. As for the renters, up to 2008 no tax credits were allowed for the main residence. At present, a tax credit related to personal income of the renter (up to about 30,000 euro) is allowed; it is higher for renters younger than 30 years old.",

Since SHIW-BI information on the number and on the characteristics of the main residences is reliable, we use this information in order to reconcile the number of dwellings other than the main residence owned by households with aggregate statistics published by the National Land Agency. This calibration is important to obtain a reliable estimation of revenues from housing taxes, and to correctly evaluate the distribution of housing taxation among households. In order to solve the problem, we then consider the whole SHIW-BI sub-sample of households owning at least the main residence and randomly attribute the missing dwellings. Excluding owner occupied dwellings (16.1 million), our estimates suggest that the total number of other dwellings owned by households is about 10 million. <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a> reports the estimated composition by type of utilization: 0.7 million (6.8 percent) are used by life-tenants, 3.5 million (35 percent) are rented to other families, 1.5 million (14.9 percent) are given up free of charge, while the unoccupied dwelling and holiday homes are 4.3 million (43.3 percent).",

This is the estimation of the cadastral value and the cadastral income of each dwelling. This is important since it represents the ICI and House-PIT tax base, respectively, to be imputed to each taxpayer. The National Land Agency estimates the number and the composition, as well as the overall cadastral value of dwellings (i.e., the overall ICI tax base). The SHIW-BI dataset contains information on the current market value of each dwelling owned by households. We compare these two aggregate values in order to obtain the average underestimation of overall cadastral values with respect to overall market values. Then, we impute the same percentage of underestimation (which is approximately equal to 77 percent) to the current value of each dwelling declared by each interviewee. By dividing the result by 100, and using the percentage of ownership of each person within the household, we obtain the cadastral income included in each taxpayer\u2019s definition of PIT gross income. No specific problems arise in the simulation of TARSU, since it is linked to the size of the dwelling.",

The PIT gross income distribution is then evaluated starting from the net income distribution. The transition from the post- to the pre-tax personal income of each individual has been computed by applying the algorithm proposed by <a href=\"#bib8\">Immervoll and O\u2019Donoghue (2001)</a>. Using original sample weights, the grossing-up procedure simply proportions the sum of individuals\u2019 sample weights to the dimension of the population as estimated by the National Statistical Office (ISTAT).

These differences depend on the data available to the Ministry of Finance, which exclude a large share of taxpayers with only dependent labour incomes besides their own residence. Whenever a taxpayer possesses only dependent employment incomes and the main residence cadastral income, presentation of the tax return form is not compulsory (being the main residence cadastral income fully deductible from the PIT gross income), so that only information on wage incomes are sent to the Ministry of Finance by her employer. In these cases, no information are available on the main residence cadastral income. Moreover, as discussed above, official statistics cannot consider taxpayers for whom the tax return form presentation is not compulsory, whilst the microsimulation model has detailed information to estimate all income earned by each interviewee. As a consequence, our estimates are to be considered more reliable.",

However, since 71.7 per cent of households own their main residence, the gap between the first and the last decile is relatively small (59.1 percent to 76.1 for household without mortgage and 5.3 percent to 10.1 for households with mortgage). Second, the percentage of tenants within each decile is decreasing: it is 26.7 percent in the first decile and 10 percent in the top one. The same picture is observed for rent-free tenants.",

This is not surprising: a proportional property tax could be progressive with respect to income whenever housing wealth is increasing with respect to income. But ICI do not consider real market values of dwellings, and the cadastral values are highly underestimated. A similar situation is experienced by the TARSU: tax debt is determined by multiplying a tariff per square meter by the total square meters of the dwelling.

As for taxes, we consider the overall tax system and then we focus on each specific tax on housing considered in the paper. <a href=\"#table10\">Table 10</a> reports Kakwani indices for the overall tax-benefit system, the House-PIT, ICI and TARSU. Differently from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>, here we consider all households. The overall Kakwani index is 0.053. Both ICI and TARSU do not influence tax progressivity, while the House-PIT (which refers to the taxation of second homes, being the main residences exempt) explains about 10% of the overall tax progressivity. This is not surprising given the high percentage of households with their wealth invested in real estates. Given this situation, the Italian policy maker should consider housing taxation and the reform of figurative rents as an important issue for enhancing tax progressivity of the system as a whole. However, this is not what happened in Italy during the last years, as we show in the next section taking as an example the 2008 Property Tax reform.",

Here we take as an example the 2008 reform of the Property Tax, that basically exempted the main residence. In principle, given the mild regressivity and the generosity of the current system, one would have expected to observe a reform aimed at reconciling cadastral incomes with current market values. Despite this, no reforms to introduce a sort of mark-to-market mechanisms for the update of cadastral income have been proposed in the last decades. On the contrary, given the high number of owner-occupiers, in order to gain political benefits, from 2008 ownership of the main residence is even exempted from taxation not only with respect to income taxation, but also with respect to the Property Tax. There are two main concerns about this reform: on the one hand, ICI is the most important local tax, so that revenues accruing to Municipalities decreased from about 12 billion euro in 2006 to about 9 billion euro in 2008 (from 5.2 billion euro to 2.4 when considering only dwelling own by households), with the difference being covered by state transfers that limit the local government responsibility; on the other hand, as long as the ownership of the main residence increases the taxpayer ability to pay, the 2008 tax cuts go in the direction of <i>lowering</i> the progressive impact of the tax system as a whole.",

In order to provide an application of our model, we then study the Property Tax reform in 2008, which basically exempted the main residence. All households owning the main residence gain from the 2008 reform, but tax cuts are mostly concentrated on the last three deciles of household equivalent gross income, so that the richest benefited most.",

One first example is its use for the simulation of alternative policy reforms. For instance, an important question to be asked is relative to the impact of a policy aimed at reconciling cadastral values with market values. The enlargement of the tax base will allow the government to reduce tax wedges on capital and, more importantly, labour incomes. What are the expected effects on efficiency and those on equity is a question that deserves an answer, especially for a country - like Italy - where the reduction of the cost of labour is a highly debated issue. A second example is related to political economy issues: the microsimulation model will allow us to define net gainers and net losers when implementing a policy reform, hence explaining whether or not a given policy has any chances to be really implemented in terms of political support.",
