The immense micro to macro complexity thereby created reduces the transparency of the economic environment of all actors in the model, including Government as a policy maker, to a fraction of what is needed for informed decisions. The policy maker thereby loses its presumed information advantage of economy wide overview and becomes one bounded rational actor among all other ignorant actors. Because of the strong leverage on the entire economy of its actions the competence and information demands on Government, when conducting policy, however, becomes far more exacting than what is required of any other actor.",

We find that financial markets matter for long term economic development and that seemingly insignificant respecifications of the financial market regime can cause considerable differences in long term GNP growth outcomes, amounting to as much as a difference of 1.5 percentage points per annum and a per capita GNP, that is up to 2.5 times larger on the 60 year horizon than in the worst scenario.",

When introducing a crudely modeled securitized system (call options), the only one our computer system could handle, financial market transactions were, however, speeded up to the extent that resource allocations worsened. Mixing the capital market regime with the simple securitized system generally lowered long run economic growth. Adding options not only increased the speed of arbitrage, destabilizing fundamentals, but also made expectations unreliable and raised the exit rate, notably by making manufacturing firms lose money on their financial investment portfolios. The results on options cannot however be generalized beyond the very specific experimental designs implemented, but they indicate that speeded up market arbitrage, which is what financial derivatives are all about, has mixed economy wide consequences, that may be long term negative in an economy that is not otherwise diversified and robust. While the simulation analysis of the markets for derivates in the MOSES model is still too primitive to allow any empirical generalizations, the results so far should be taken seriously as indicative of possible surprise dynamics that makes it even more important to conduct more inquiries of this kind.",

The non-linear specifications of the model often generate large differences in very long run outcomes when the stochastic seeds are changed marginally. Hence, the results to be reported should be regarded as explorative, suggesting new credible hypotheses, rather than empirically calibrated results, and also telling what kind of future analyses the new expanded model is capable of.",

The interest setting process is central to that allocation. The financial system, however, is also an intermediary in the reallocation of wealth and real resources over markets. Changes in financing conditions thus affect the allocation of investments and production structures across the firm population and all relative prices. The consequent increase in dynamic complexity reduces transparency of the economic environment of all actors in the model, including Government as a policy maker. To be noted is that the separability between the financial and real systems often assumed in financial modelling does not hold under these new circumstances of micro- to \u2013 macro modelling. Uninformed production firms that dabble in financial markets may thus cause a distortion in asset price structures that lead to miss allocations of real resources and less macro economic growth. Policy makers that erroneously believe that they are well informed are at particularly large economy wide risk.",

The efficient functioning of financial markets and their supporting institutions, hence, is a particular concern. Since the policy maker is such an institution rather than a commercial market agent, an interesting market conundrum may be expected.",

What is new in the analysis to follow is <i>the explicit and dynamic integration of financial and real market transactions in the business plans of firms</i>. <a href=\"#bib4\">Allen and Gale (1994)</a> estimated that new financial instruments intermediating a more informed and efficient allocation of (financial) risks have lowered the cost of financing and increased the stock market value of US manufacturing firms significantly, <i>given</i> the real (physical) allocation of resources. The last ceteris paribus clause is critical for interpreting their results. We explicitly account for the influence on rational financial and real market agents in determining (a) the allocation of real resources, and (b) economic growth. Hence the allocation of real resources is not given but will be endogenously affected by the introduction of new financial instruments in the simulation experiments to follow. We expect the economy wide systemic effects of that \"simultaneity\" to be considerably larger than calculated in the static analysis of Allen &amp; Gale. We will also demonstrate how different assessments of risk (or rather uncertainty) based on historical data affect portfolio performance in what we will call an <i>Experimentally Organized Economy (EOE</i>). For this we use the dynamic micro (firm) based macro model of the Swedish Economy MOSES that approximates an EOE.",

Instead the rugged terrain of physical production structures is constantly changing because of the market selection activities going on, a notable exaple of that being the endogenous entering and exiting of firms. This defines market life in what we call a model of the <i>Experimentally Organized Economy (EOE) in which new technology creation, and business decisions are viewed as economic experiments to be tested in markets, and market selection dominat</i>es <i>economy wide behavior</i>. In this model the standard <i>separability assumption</i> of financial economics has been done away with <i>by integrating financial, product and labor markets price expectations in the management systems of individual competing firms.</i> Hence, we have to tell a brief story of the EOE through its model approximation MOSES. <i>Second</i>, the derivatives market is characterized by strong innovative product development and diversity. Practical problems, notably computing capacity, however, prevent the representation of all that diversity in the model, even though it would have been perfectly possible in principle. Note that the entire derivatives market consists of a computerized network of trading in mathematical algorithms with ad hoc human interaction. Even though the actual simulation runs for this paper are based on a fairly primitive model of trade in the stock and options markets (see <a href=\"#bib87\">Taymaz, 1999</a>) the interpretations of the experiments have to be preceded by a broad-brush presentation of the derivatives market to place what we have done quantitatively in a relevant theoretical context.",

To capture that in theory we briefly introduce the notion of a <i>Knowledge Based Information Economy</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Eliasson, 1990b</a>) to clarify the assumptions of the Experimentally Organized Economy (EOE, <a href=\"#bib31\">Eliasson, 1987</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">Eliasson, 1991a</a>), and that our analysis is predicated on a state space, or a business opportunities space, that is enormous and only fractionally (and differently) known to each agent in the market. This establishes an enormous potential for productivity advance at higher levels of aggregation through recombining factors of production and reallocating resources (see <a href=\"#bib12\">Carlsson, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Eliasson, 1998b</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Eliasson and Taymaz, 2000</a> for empirical evidence). It also introduces an economic environment which to each actor is largely unknown when viewed from any point in state space. Since each actor views its local environment through its own interpretation filter it is apt to be both grossly ignorant, and significantly misinformed about circumstances that may jeopardize its very survival as a market agent. The investment process of each actor is therefore likely to be a path strewn with more or less serious business mistakes and occasional winners.

Individual firm R&amp;D investments (after <a href=\"#bib7\">Ballot and Taymaz, 1998</a>) raise the probability of the firm of scoring a winning technology with superior productivity characteristics compared to those in the exogenous pool (Item 2 in the list above).<a href=\"#fn17\"><sup>17</sup></a> The new productivity vintages are then integrated with the existing capital equipment of the firm (see <a href=\"#bib35\">Eliasson, 1991a</a>). The productivity characteristics of new entrants are drawings from a similar empirical distribution (Item 4 above), only that the spread is much wider. For practical measurement reasons the MOSES model runs on well-defined observation units (firms or divisions) that either enter or exit or grow or shrink through their endogenous production, rercruiting and investment decisions. In the economy wide perspective of the micro to macro model reorganization (Item 2 in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>), hence, can be interpreted as both limited to internal firm reorganization and reorganization among firms through selection. So far, we have not had the time to generalize the firm model to accounting also for internal reorganizations even though it would have been good to have such a feature in this context of financial market analysis, for instance to understand the economy wide importance of having or not having viable markets for mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A).

This theoretical \"insight\" generated a mounting controversy in academe and in the financial community. Above all the famous Fisher separability proposition was questioned. It stated that decisions in real product markets and financial markets could be kept separate. Already here those new abstractions clashed with the economics of MOSES firms in that price expectations in product, labour and financial markets are integrated in the business plans of individual firms, plans that are then from period to period tested against each other \"for consistency\" in markets, revised and then tested again. Another point of criticism was that financial transactions costs in the new theory were assumed to be zero. None of this is true in the MOSES economy, so we have an interesting \"empirical\" problem to address below in that (1) financial and real markets are explicitly integrated by management in the business plans of MOSES firms, and (2) that business mistakes of types I and II (see Section 2.3) become market transactions costs with fundamental economy wide consequences.",

In their two central planning scenarios firm management had to build their plan on the predictions of one of the two.

Swapping meant that the outcome for the parties was anyhow the same. Regulators had created a \"semi barter\" market, forcing parties to resort to more costly transactions forms (swaps).",

With such a phase shift any traditional analytic estimate of volatility in the pricing of options by the B-S/M algorithm will be completely misleading, and result in sudden unpredicted wealth transfers between investors. One idea would be to make traders use efficient data mining in the MOSES economy to discover \"correlations to trade on\". This search could dig deeply into MOSES microstructures relating volatility measures to the interior performance of firms, for instance. If such search for correlations starts from different ends different traders will find different correlations, and belief in those correlations will increase with the number of \"confirming\" observations (as discussed in statistical learning theory). In a classical general equilibrium environment with costless search and optimum search principles designed for the same equilibrium environment, traders will eventually find a desired equilibrium \"point\" (<a href=\"#bib73\">Lindh, 1993</a>). If the environment does not have those nice equilibrium properties, such as in MOSES, and if search is not costless, correlations compatible with a different theory, or any \"nonsense\" correlation (used by \"noise traders\") will at best be temporarily reliable, but soon guide traders into unexpected and not desired chaotic market circumstances. In a healthy market economy this would now and then be a normal experience for individual traders, and a normal cost for economic development in an Experimentally Organized Economy (EOE, <a href=\"#bib35\">Eliasson, 1991a</a>), but economy wide disaster if a very large number of agents, or central government commit the same mistake. Differential expectations are therefore a market stabilizing element of an EOE. Differential expectations could be created in the MOSES economy in a market game with many outsider investors with different background experiences. .",

These price trends and the (also exogenous) foreign interest rate have been set such that firms bringing in best practice globally available exogenous technologies (endogenously through their investments) should be capable by adjusting their wage offers to earn a long term return on the new investment equal to the foreign interest rate. This fairly orderly exogenous global market scenario is, however, complicated in the local Swedish MOSES economy by its initial state that defines numerically how individual firms are positioned at the start of a simulation experiment relative to global markets.<a href=\"#fn27\"><sup>27</sup></a> While the orderly predictable global market environment assumed significantly dampens the resource allocation outcomes of the simulations in ways we did not anticipate when the experiments were designed, the initial state, on the other hand, raises the complexity of interpreting what is happening in the model enormously. Since the MOSES model economy is propelled forward by firms\u2019 price expectations, investments and production plans made up under the upper constraint defined by the globally available best practice technologies its selection based non linear properties tend to make small initial circumstances cumulate long term into very different directions, a common \"chaotic\" property of such models.<a href=\"#fn28\"><sup>28</sup></a> The economy wide outcomes are leveraged up further by the endogenous population of firms, a unique property of the Moses model economy (<a href=\"#bib44\">Eliasson, 1996b</a>).

Mix the two (E1101) and long-term growth deteriorates somewhat, or a lot (E1111).

The surprising outcome, however, is that adding market boosters to the successful industrial banking and capital market regimes in the form of options instruments turn out negative macroeconomic results, and predominanrly by raising the exit rate without a corresponding increase in the number of entrants (Cf E0100 with E2100 , and E0110 with E2110). Unfortunately, the available computer capacity did not allow us to trace down the exact reasons for that result. Previous experience from the model, however, tells that long term growth is positively associated with competition induced reorganization and reallocations of resources, but that the same structural change, if \"too fast\" also lowers price predictability in product markets. If market reallocations are too fast the consequent structural change makes current prices lose their predictive information about next period prices to the extent that misallocations of resources occur that instead lower long-term growth. Such negative long term consequences of overexcited markets should be expected to cumulate the closer to market clearing or balanced operating conditions the model economy is operating (<a href=\"#bib26\">Eliasson, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Eliasson, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Eliasson, 1991a</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Eliasson and Taymaz, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Eliasson et al., 2001</a>). Since external (export) market conditions of the experimental design, as mentioned, are those of a global economy in approximate \"stochastic market clearing equilibrium\" also internal model markets will be sensitive to market speeds. Introducing derivatives in the model raises the speed of financial market arbitrage and perhaps too much when the economy is operating with very little slack and little room for positive short term resource reallocations. Increased market speeds will then cause market disorder at a time when the potential for large resource reallocation gains is small and cause an excessive exiting of firms. Experiments with options seem to illustrate this. Options experiments generally rank low and wind up on the horizon with exceptionally small firm poulations (E2100, E2200, E2110, E2210). When stock market financing is allowed, improvements can be observed, notably with firm specific but slow rate of interest arbitrage, and more firms survive (E2001, E2101, E 2201). Market volatility was at maximum under the securitized market regimes. Firms making losses on stock speculations had to pay high interest rates and/or go bankrupt, even though they might have been superb performers as producers. The exit rate in the options experiments is unusually high and the number of remaining firms on the horizon unusually low compared to all other experiments.",

This raises two questions about the relative importance of (1) external circumstances, and (2) initial conditions. Stable relative prices in global markets mean more predictable prices for exporters as well as domestic prices compared to the price pivoting experiments conducted in <a href=\"#bib26\">Eliasson (1983)</a>. The latter forced large structural adjustment in manufacturing industry, a transition that probably would have been more smoothly engineered by the sophisticated financial markets introduced in this study. Under long term predictable external market circumstances, on the other hand, firm management does not need to engage in high risk ventures into new technologies, and the simple profit plow back industrial banking financial regimes perform well, and also allow the entire economy to tick along at rates of \"full employment and little unused capacities\". Then speedier financial market regimes add little to macro economic performance, and may even destabilize market allocations of resources.",

Since no such determinate equilibrium state exists in the Moses model economy comparative statics does not make sense. Neither does the Moses economy operate on a neoclassical steady state equilibrium growth path. Comparing such steady states is sometimes called <i>comparative dynamics</i>, even though there is no market dynamics involved in determining their diverging paths. MOSES is selection based, highly non linear and initial state dependent. So, attention has to be paid to what its initial state means for its long term evolution. Only then can we talk about \"true comparative dynamics\". Even though the initial states are the same in all experiments for this study the paths the model economy takes into the future apparently are very different depending on which market regime we enact. And, by accident and discovered late, even small changes in initial conditions between these experiments and the same market experiments conducted in <a href=\"#bib87\">Taymaz (1999)</a> tend to cumulate, as a comparison of the numbers within, and not within brackets show in <a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a>. This complicates the evaluation of different market regimes for long term economic evolution considerably. Since this is a study in microsimulation method, and not an attempt to empirically evaluate the merits of different market regimes in a Sweden like industrial economy, we leave this observation as an experience for a future study, and then hopefully with more available computer capacity.",

Mixing the two regimes (as in E1111) confuses markets and long-term performance drops significantly.

They lose that advantage in a fast capital market regime, and apparently also in an even faster securitized regime. We have not been able to figure out exactly how, but indicationas are that long term winners have been deprived of financing when the two high performance regimes were integrated.. This possibility was also observed theoretically in the competence bloc analysis of <a href=\"#bib57\">Eliasson and Eliasson (1996)</a>. It seems not to be possible to identify those future winners through improved market price signaling, which presents the market analyst with a tricky problem since the future high performance of these winners can partly be traced back to initial conditions, not however the circumstances that helped them along during the historic simulation. There is also the possibility that some of the long term winners lost, and especially in the securitized market regime, had engaged in loss making portfolio speculation and had had to exit because of that, despite a superb manufacturing performance. A different set of initial conditions (not those determined empirically in the Planning Survey of the Federation of Swedish Industries) might therefore have generated a very different long-term outcome. These were surprise results from explorative experiments on the MOSES model. For the time being we however lack the computing capacity to clarify the underlying \"empirical\" details of these results.

Mixing the two (in E1111) however lowers long term macro output. On the face of it entry is lowered somewhat compared to both, and exits are increased . The most probable reason is that markets have been speeded up further from the already efficient \"static\" allocation achieved separately in E1001 and E0110. Markets have been excessively excited, discouraging new entry and forcing more firms to exit, probably including long term winners that survived in the other two experiments. Changing from either into a securitized financial market system (E2002 and E2110) appears not to be a good idea. The negative long term growth outcomes of introducing options in an efficient industrial banking or capital market regime may be a surprise compared to the standard theoretical predictions of financial models. For one thing, however, we have only tried a primitive version of a securitized financial market. Secondly, however, and more to the point, external world market (export) prices by exogenous assumption have been almost in \"stochastic equilibrium\" in the sense that relative exogenous change in prices in the four subindustries are fluctuating around a slow inflation trend that under the adaptive expectations regime of the model firms will be quite predictable \"in expectation\". Hence also domestic markets will be predictable, meaning that an industrial market regime with firms being dominantly self-financed will work quite well, and a capital market regime with stock market financing should not, as demonstrated, be more than a marginal improvement. When, on the other hand, global markets are subjected to wrenching unpredictable change in prices, as in the price pivoting experiments on MOSES in <a href=\"#bib26\">Eliasson (1983)</a>, the improved flexibility in financial market resource reallocations associated (theoretically) with financial derivatives, should make for improvements in long term growth outcomes. In our experiments, on the other hand, with predictable global markets and a global economy operating close to market clearing with a minimum of slack, we have probably experienced again, what we have learned from many previous experiments, that an economy close to predictable market clearing, is sensitive to speedy market transactions, and that this may explain the negative outcomes of speeding up financial market transactions in our model experiments under such conditions.

Still, the stock market experiment shows significantly larger investments, notably towards the end of the period when rates of return increase and an investment boom occurs. Apparently, this is the outcome of a series of circumstances we have observed before (e.g. in <a href=\"#bib61\">Eliasson and Lindberg, 1986</a>) when firms in an early phase of the options experiment are forced to raise rate of return requirements because of the increase in interest rates (a result of the introduction of options). When finding fewer profitable investments, firms choose to lower their investment spending and reduce employment. (This does not necessarily have to be associated with an increase in exits forced by financial portfolio losses by manufacturing firms, as in earlier experiments). The opposite dynamic occurs in the stock market case. With softer rate of return requirements in the first part of the period firms slowly gear up for expansion that culminates with an investment boom during the second half of the of the 60-year simulation. With the higher exit rate of low performing firms in this case, the boom should be sustainable beyond the 60-year horizon. Again, however, a proper comparison of the outcomes of the different market regimes would require a series of complementary and longer run experiments than our current computer capacities allow.

Given a predictable long term global market price scenario, an internal finance based industrial bank system or a capital market regime based on stock market finance, appears to be best for promoting long term growth. Mix the two, or worse, introduce an options (securitized) system on top of either one, and growth outcomes deteriorate significantly. The reason is that speeded up financial markets disturbs, rather than improves allocative performance in an economy which has already achieved an allocation of physical resources that is internationally competitive. There was little additional scope for neither short term slack reduction nor faster reallocations of workers over the labour market. Under a predictable long term global product market scenario, and firms governed by adaptive price expectations more broad based and faster financial market arbitrage thus added little to economy wide long term growth performance. Profit plow back supported by bank finance of rapidly expanding firms offered as much financial market induced growth as was possible under a given technological regime. These are \"theoretical\" simulation results on a calibrated model. Even though limited computer capacity has prevented us from testing for the robustness of these results by Monte Carlo experiments, we feel comfortable concluding that they illustrate the difficulties for politicians of designing an optimal financial market regime under the complex realistic circumstances of our analysis. We refer to the results from simulation experiments on the agent based model MOSES, calibrated to represent a \"Sweden like industrial economy, as theoretical, but with sufficient empirical relevance to be taken seriously.",

If the theoretical and empirical results from static general equilibrium modeling , for instance those by <a href=\"#bib4\">Allen and Gale (1994)</a>, have any relevance for a real economy, this is what they must have had in mind. But even so, the results so far from MOSES simulations present policy makers with a formidable problem. High speed financial market arbitrage doesn\u2019t seem to be generally good for the economy. (The experiments of this study show the Moses model to be very sensitive to choice of financial market regime, and to respond strongly negatively over the long term to increased financial market speeds when the economy is already structurally well adjusted to product and factor market prices. To redesign financial market regimes according to unreliable forecasts of long term product market and technology change therefore require far more sophisticated policy designs than seem to have been understood in literature).",

But even seemingly minor such changes can cause dramatic drops in long term economy wide performance (E2211 &gt;E2210 or E1111 &gt; E1110). We have already warned about the importance of controlling for biases caused by stochastic events through Monte Carlo sensitivity tests. The very possibility furthermore of seemingly insignificant circumstances cumulating into major economy wide change with time, typical of nonlinear initial state dependent and selection-based models, are characteristics likely to also characterize real economies, and should be taken seriously when showing up in model simulations. Speeded up markets in an already efficient model economy are likely to prematurely kill more winners or to generate more Type II economic mistakes the consequences of which then cumulate over the sixty year simulation. It is our belief that such consequences explain the seriously worsened economy wide outcome when introducing securitized financial instruments. It is again possible in principle to check back through frequent reruns of the model to what extent this is the reason.

Simulation analyses on the Swedish Moses model have given numerically precise answers to those questions. The corollary question however is how empirically credible they are. A first such question is to what extent these new financial products have helped to <i>pull resources out of badly managed firms and reallocated them over markets to more promising firms</i>. Will the result be more efficient investments and faster long-term growth in the Sweden like Moses model economy? One result seems clear. If the economy is already operating on an efficiently allocated structure of resources the scope for fast reallocational gains is limited and if pushed for too ambitiously, by for instance policy, is likely to destabilize markets and reduce liong run economy wide outcomes.",

Such an experimental design, we realized late, would benefit an economy populated with profitable globally competitive firms, so shaped by having been subjected to global competition for a long time, as was the case with Swedish manufacturing industry, and hence the Sweden like model economy Moses. Under such circumstances profit plow back into existing firms complemented by (industrial) bank finance should generate satisfactory long term growth, as has also been borne out by the experiments. Under those assumptions speeded up financial market arbitrage would not necessarily benefit growth. As the experiments indicate it might rather disturb markets, lower price predictability under adaptive expectations. Resource allocations will be less informed and worsen long run growth outcomes, an interpretation that is supported by previous model experiments, for instance in <a href=\"#bib26\">Eliasson (1983)</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Eliasson (1984)</a> and <a href=\"#bib35\">Eliasson (1991a)</a>. This adds a third concern for the policy maker, namely to what extent the model economy has been sufficiently diverse and robust to benefit from faster and more efficient financial arbitrage. Deficient diversity of structures is likely to be a deficiency of all micro based model abstractions of a real economy. The quantitative importance of this deficiency can however in principle be tested for by adding more firms to the Moses model and making entrepreneurial entry more vigorous which the early experiments in <a href=\"#bib36\">Eliasson (1991b)</a> also support.",

Such a system, lacking open financial markets for across firm resource transfer makes it possible for Government to control to some extent, through bank regulation, the allocation of financial resources in the economy. Such was the financial market regime in Sweden during the early post WWII period through much of the 1980s. The Swedish Government used credit market controls to provide cheap financing for public sector growth, and to patronize a select group of large export firms. This worked OK (1) until the market destabilizing influence of counteracting savers that were earning large negative real interests after inflation and taxes, and increasing financial across border leakage forced a policy reversal (<a href=\"#bib62\">Eliasson and Taymaz, 1992</a>) and (2), until global technological change subjected Swedish export producers to new and radical demands for structural adjustments during the 1990s. New C&amp;C technology based financial products and the introduction of a <i>capital market financial regime</i> helped a new and more flexible financial market scenario materialize. We therefore introduced first a capital market regime in MOSES of the type gradually introduced in Sweden from the second half of the 1980s, and then some rudiments of a <i>securitized financial system</i>. Again, such a securitized financial regime became an increasing reality in Sweden in the first decade of the new millennium. The three levels of financial market sophistication and regimentation in fact correspond to the situation in Europe in the 1960s (industrial banking backed up by exchange controls), in the 1970s and part of the 1980s (a gradual break up of exchange controls caused by international market arbitrage, \"euro dollars\"), and from the late 1980s an increasing securitization of the financial systems. While the experiments in this study have been designed to represent political and institutional development, unfortunately the external global market was assumed to be the same, which reduced the generality of the experimental designs.",

Again, however, the diversity of structures and robustness of the Moses model compared to the real economy it is supposed to represent, warrants caution of interpretation. The real Swedish economy should be more robust.

Since opportunities depend on how each actor reacts to the decisions of all heterogeneous and differently sized actors in the market there is no theoretical chance for even a reasonably informed market except by awkward assumption. We claim that ours is an empirically reasonable assumption. <a href=\"#bib82\">Smith and Watts (1992)</a>, on the other hand, define the opportunities set to be captured by the ratio of the market to the booked value of the firm. S &amp;W hence assume that there exists a marginal group of actors in the market that is fully informed about the size and the economic value of all opportunities.

To prevent the unrealistic consequence that with time everything will eventually be learned about we impose an <i>Information Paradox</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Eliasson, 1990b</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Eliasson, 2001</a>) stating that the opportunities space expands from (costly) exploration of agents, and faster the more intense that exploration in that firms, being challenged, learn and discover new combinations (innovation). We furthermore make the empirical assumption that the opportunities space thereby expands faster than all exploring agents can learn about its expanding content. Therefore, we acknowledge the empirical possibility (the paradox) that the markets are getting increasingly ignorant of what can in principle be known. In MOSES analysis we frequently refer to this as the S\u00e4rimner Proposition, from then pig in the Viking Sagas that was eaten for supper in Valhalla by the constantly brawling Vikings, but came back next morning, to be eaten again next evening (<a href=\"#bib31\">Eliasson, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Eliasson, 1992a</a>).

The greater the value of s<sub>respon</sub>, the greater and faster the reaction of the agent to price differentials in the stock market. Since agents may have different expectations about future prices (because they use different models for forecasts, they combine short run and long run expectations differently, they may have different attitudes towards risks, etc.), those who believe that the stock price will increase tend to buy stock this quarter, and others tend to sell stocks. The offer price, P<sup>offer</sup>, is found through an iterative process that equates total supply to total demand for each stock.",

For simplicity, we assume that there are only call options, i.e., the holder has the right to buy the stock at the exercise date, which is one quarter after the agreement. The holder (buyer) pays the option price (defined as a certain percentage of the value of the option) to the seller when they sign the contract. At the exercise date, if the stock price is higher than the strike price, the holder buys the stocks from the seller at the strike price. Otherwise, the option will not be exercised.",

This very fact, however, at the same time illustrates the importance for the development of dynamic markets for derivatives of computer and communications technology.
