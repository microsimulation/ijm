                "text": "Forecasting Populations (FPOP) is a microsimulation model (MSM) that is the demographic core of an extensible modeling framework. The framework, with FPOP at its core, enables the geospatial projection of a population under purely demographic processes or under the additional influence of exogenous factors such as disease, policy changes and prevention programs, or environmental stressors. Empirically-derived transition probabilities of life events such as birth, death, marriage, divorce and migration, captured in lookup table format, drive the simulation. These transition probabilities can be modified dynamically by external user-defined functions or other external MSMs. The use of MSM structures and methodologies enables FPOP to portray the impact of heterogeneity in the geospatial dimension (e.g., distribution of environmental factors or distribution of intervention programs), as well as the social dimension (e.g., household or social network correlates), on the projections. POP is designed and structured to: enable linking with external MSMs of any kind; support inclusion or configuration of more detailed transition probabilities; be scalable to millions of agents; use either an existing baseline synthetic population or a custom synthetic population of the user\u2019s design; and, run under computing environments that don\u2019t require a high degree of specialized software or hardware. In this paper we describe the design and structure of FPOP and then apply FPOP first under purely demographic processes and, secondly, in conjunction with an external disease model of obesity.",

These techniques model the dynamics of a population by simulating change in the demographic and social behaviors of its micro-units over the life course. MSMs provide a powerful analytic tool for exploring how populations may behave in the future as they can capture the heterogeneity inherent in a population due to social factors (such as household or familial attributes) that either affect or are affected by the risk from external phenomena of interest (<a href=\"#bib32\">NAS 1991</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">2011</a>).",

More recently, models have been extended to explore health outcomes (Luke and Stamatakis, 2013), such as infectious disease transmission and spread (<a href=\"#bib10\">Eubank 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ferguson <i>et al.</i>, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Longini 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cooley 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lee 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Geard 2013</a>), obesity (<a href=\"#bib46\">van Baal <i>et al.</i>, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lymer 2012</a>], the effects of tobacco control policies on smoking (<a href=\"#bib15\">Goldstone 2005</a>), and in the evaluation of screening recommendations on breast and prostate cancer (CISNET Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network, CISNET.gov) (see review by <a href=\"#bib43\">Rutter 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kopec 2012</a>).

For social processes that occur over long time frames, MSMs offer the flexibility to investigate, for example, inter-relationships among individuals (e.g., sexual behaviors and treatment compliance), causal factors (treatment effectiveness), and disease traits (secondary infection rates and genetic mutation rates) over time (Zaidi 2009; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zucchelli 2010</a>).",

Using an iterative process, these modules influence population size, structure, and characteristics independently of FPOP\u2019s empirically-derived demographic core components. When linked to an exogenous MSM (such as a chronic disease model) we illustrate how the health status of the individuals derived from the disease model updates life event probabilities for FPOP. Prevention strategies can be layered as an additional component onto the disease model to evaluate the combined impact on future populations. The overarching goal of FPOP is to capture the effects of demographic change on the household and population structure over arbitrarily long periods into the future. Because the transition probabilities are defined externally and the framework architecture is modular, FPOP does not need to be modified to run in alternative frameworks representing other populations or non-health scenarios.",

The life events that modify households and populations include aging, mortality, birth, marriage/union formation and dissolution, and migration. The occurrence of life events for each individual at each discrete time step is determined stochastically by transition probabilities that subsequently can be modified during the course of the simulation. Life events occur by generating a random value from a uniform probability distribution with range [0,1] and comparing that value with the individual\u2019s event-specific probability.

Because these text files drive the generic routines within FPOP for matching a synthetic individual with a demographic event probability, researchers are able to configure multidimensional probability lookup tables according to the availability of data. It is also through these life event probabilities that external models can impact the population projection. For instance, external model estimates of the effectiveness of various interventions may modify individual probabilities of death and therefore the overall future size, composition, and distribution of the population.

The obesity prevention model was structured on diet programs designed to limit intake of total fats, free sugars, and sodium and increase consumption of fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and nuts. We translated this into a hypothetical behavioral intervention that consisted of a period of reduced caloric intake followed by a maintenance period.

FPOP was designed to be relatively simple, with reasonable data and computational requirements and the ability to link to external models of broad interest. In addition, FPOP is highly scalable. Changes in life events, determined by empirically-derived transition probabilities and captured in lookup table format, can be modified dynamically in FPOP by either externally-defined functions or other modules in the modeling environment. Users who have more geospatially specific, more recent, or more detailed transition probability data can easily incorporate that data into their FPOP runs.

FPOP offers a flexible tool because both the baseline population and the transition probabilities are external. A FPOP implementation may use any synthetic microdata database or administrative or census data of actual individuals that contains both household and person-level characteristics as its baseline and the associated description of transition probabilities for significant life events. For illustration, we first selected a synthetic population for North Carolina from the publicly available U.S. 2010 Synthetic Population<sup><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup> with FPOP transition probabilities defined from survey and vital statistics data. The North Carolina baseline population includes 9.5 million individuals and 3.74 million households\u2014each with a specific set of latitude/longitude coordinates. We subsequently extended the FPOP model to project the population effects of an obesity prevention program on adults in Yogyakarta, Indonesia using a baseline population representative of every household and household occupant and their location. The external models linkage feature of FPOP allows geospatial and temporal projection of populations in response to various externally-defined and independently functioning modules, ex., health or environmental events, disease, economic factors. Although MSMs that simulate both spatial and household characteristics exist, for instance, SMILE (O\u2019Donoghue 2011), SimBritain (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ballas 2005</a>), SVIERGE (<a href=\"#bib17\">Holm 2008</a>), these models simulate specific populations (i.e., household residents of Ireland, Britain, and Sweden) and were developed to address specific policy questions.",

The cohort-component method treats each cohort as a homogenous group, as opposed to individuals independently, and uses average probabilities of fertility, mortality, and migration, as opposed to individual probabilities based on personal characteristics which stochastically drive the determination of a demographic event. With consideration of multiple individual attributes, ex., age, sex, race, and ethnicity, etc., the computational requirements using the cohort-component method become complex since each combination of attributes must be tracked (<a href=\"#bib47\">Van Imhoff 1998</a>). FPOP performs well even with large numbers of attributes, both individual and household, and can be based on an entire population, not a sample.

Linkage to external disease models allow users, for example, to investigate heterogeneity in individual characteristics influencing disease onset and persistence over time, to quantify and forecast future independent effects of potential disease interventions on mortality, and to examine how change from one demographic state to another impacts disease outcomes over an individual\u2019s lifetime. The flexibility of our approach and its research value arises from the design of the system, which allows those external models to influence population size, structure, and characteristics independently of FPOP\u2019s empirically-derived demographic core components. This coupled system provides significant advantages over models that employ static aging and models that include limited interaction between demographic, behavioral, and disease characteristics.",

Future model enhancements to FPOP include additional individual and household-level attributes and model parameters. Access to vital statistics microdata beginning with the year 2005 which includes a greater level of geographic detail has been acquired, permitting further refinements in terms of geography and time to measures of fertility and mortality.
