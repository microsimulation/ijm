The paper by Dieter Vandelannote, Andre\u2019 Decoster, Toon Vanheukelom and Gerlinde Verbist analyses the quality of gross incomes as reported in the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), a dataset that is widely used in European microsimulation models, and finds that the SILC underestimates incomes, as compared to fiscal data. A calibration method to reconstruct gross incomes from net incomes is presented and discussed. The second paper, by Sarah Kuypers, Francesco Figari and again Gerlinde Verbist, look at the prospects for using the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) dataset as an underlying micro-database for the EU tax-benefit model, EUROMOD. In this case it is a measure of net income which is missing, and the authors simulate them with EUROMOD. The third paper in the section is by Esteban Mu\u00f1oz, Ivan Dochev, Hannes Seller and Irene Peters, and presents a spatial microsimulation method to construct synthetic cities.",

The method outperforms the algorithms generally used in the literature (see the review by <a href=\"#bib3\">Li &amp; O'Donoghue, 2014</a>), and represents a real advance in microsimulation modelling. After all those methodological papers, the last two contributions focus of application of microsimulation modelling to health issues in Australia. The paper by Sharyn Lymer, Deborah Schofield, Crystal M Y Lee and Stephen Colagiuri deals with simulation of multiple chronic diseases and associated risk factors. The model offers 15 year projections \u2013from 2010 to 2025 \u2013 using a combination of static and dynamic methods. Finally, the paper by Alison Ritter, Nagesh Shukla, Marian Shanahan, Phuong Van Hoang, Vu Lam Cao, Pascal Perez and Michael Farrell deals with the life paths of heroin users, simulating consumption, criminal activities, treatment, and the transmission of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), and HCV (hepatitis C). The outcomes are measured in terms of costs associated with treatment provision and healthcare services, criminal activity, life years lost, and family benefit of treatment.",
