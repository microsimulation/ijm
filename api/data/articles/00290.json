By simulating the entire life-spans of native and immigrating individuals we analyse the impact of the most recent pension reform, which increased the statutory retirement age (SRA) of women from 64 to 65. Furthermore, the impact of a reduction of the conversion rate in the 2<sup>nd</sup> pillar - which is a quite likely policy scenario \u2013 is also analysed. Our simulations suggest that the GPG would decline from 23.6% in 2020 to 21.6% in 2070. Although this decline appears to be marginal, there are signs of a catching-up process, especially among higher incomes. This catching-up process of women\u2019s pensions may be driven by an increasing share of women having a tertiary educational attrition, which results in higher wages and higher activity rates. This leads to a reduction of the GPG in the upper income range. However, since labour market participation as well as the extent of part-time employment are positively correlated with the level of education, this would also lead to a larger variance in women\u2019s lifetime earnings. The simulation of the policy scenarios suggests that an increase in the SRA of women increases their retirement income only marginal, whereas a reduction of the conversion rate from 6.8% to 5.2% would decrease the 2<sup>nd</sup> pillar pension income by 23.5%.",

As these pensions in some shape or form are the result of previous earnings or labour market participation, or even of the person being present in the country, this requires the simulation of the intertemporal development of a large variety of characteristics, such as demographic ageing, the household size and marital states, activity rates, etc. In its simplest form, this is mostly done using separate discrete-dependent variable models, such as logistic regressions. However, if these estimated models are considered sub-optimal,<a href=\"#fn5\"><sup>5</sup></a> or if the researcher wishes to make use of projections that were developed by others in order not to reinvent the wheel and to paint a consistent picture, many models make use of so-called alignment techniques. Various alignment methods have been developed (<a href=\"#bib78\">Morrison, 2006</a>), but <a href=\"#bib72\">Li et al. (2014)</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Li and O\u2019Donoghue (2014)</a> conclude that, for those simulation models that focus on the impact on distributions, the sidewalk hybrid and the SBDL<a href=\"#fn6\"><sup>6</sup></a> methods achieve the best results. However, as sidewalk hybrid methods have a low computing performance, the \u201calignment by sorting\u201d by the SBDL method is widely used in complex microsimulation models, and MIDAS_CH is no exception.",

Nor are previous earnings histories available, so that the simulation of this actual implicit pension claim is not possible. Including this information on current pension upbuilding is a key ambition for the next version of MIDAS_CH, because it for now limits the simulation results to the first cohort that can be assumed not to have an implicit pension claim in 2018. This of course is the cohort that enters the labour market in 2018, and which will receive their pensions from 2062 onwards. So, for now, we need to limit our simulations to this cohort.",

A first and simple approach is to expand the starting dataset using the frequency weights, and then take a sample from the expanded dataset (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dekkers and Cumpston, 2012</a>). This approach is simple and straightforward but can result in loss of information, especially if the original dataset is comparatively small. The modelling approach (<a href=\"#bib51\">Galler, 1987, p. <span class=\"page-number\">313</span></a>) and the shared weights approach (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ernst, 1989</a>) are alternative approaches. These techniques can be used to determine the frequency weights (<a href=\"#bib93\">Schonlau et al., 2013</a>). The modelling approach is used for the panels HILDA<a href=\"#fn13\"><sup>13</sup></a> and SOEP<a href=\"#fn14\"><sup>14</sup></a> to estimate the unknown selection probabilities of new households based on a model from the known probabilities and using the inverse selection probabilities as weights (see <a href=\"#bib55\">Haisken-DeNew and Frick, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Watson, 2012</a>, for a discussion). Finally, the shared weights approach, redistributes the frequency weight of a household equally among the household members. If, for example, two individuals from two households with different frequency weights form a new household, the individual weights are summed up and divided equally among the household members of the newly formed household. In this way, the shared weights approach keeps the total of individual weights within a household constant and redistributes the weights among the household members as new individuals enter a household. The shared weights approach is, for example, used in the household panels EU-SILC (<a href=\"#bib101\">Verma et al., 2007</a>), PSID<a href=\"#fn15\"><sup>15</sup></a> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Heeringa et al., 2011</a>), BHPS,<a href=\"#fn16\"><sup>16</sup></a> SLID<a href=\"#fn17\"><sup>17</sup></a> (<a href=\"#bib71\">LaRoche, 2003</a>).",

First, to split up the last household, second to select a household for alignment to give the lowest possible mismatch, third, to carry forward any misalignment to the next period. They tested these strategies and concluded that the third strategy is the most efficient in terms of runtime and memory requirements.

Most children are born within marriages, though the number of non-marital births has increased more than fivefold since 1970.

For example, the expected average remaining life expectancy of men and women at 65 born in 1952 (who turned 65 in 2017) will be nearly 21 and nearly 25 years, respectively, and increasing to 28 and 30 years for those born in 2017 (<a href=\"#bib42\">FSO, 2020c</a>).

Therefore, for each candidate for marriage, a stable marriage market algorithm available in LIAM2 is used to match potential spouses available in the dataset (<a href=\"#bib109\">Bryon et al., 2018</a>). A first step in this procedure is the selection of potential candidates for marriage. Then women candidates are ranked based on how difficult they are to match, and the most difficult are then matched first. This \u201corder of decreasing differences algorithm\u201d prevents strange matches among the \u201clast\u201d people to be selected for marriage (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bouffard et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dekkers et al., 2009</a>). It is not unusual for the ranking of each woman to be based on the difference between her age and the average age of the male candidates. In a third step, a matrix is constructed where for each woman, all male candidates are assigned a score that represents the assumed or observed likelihood of the match. In our model, this score is based on the age of the male candidate, the difference between the age of the man and woman, and the work status of the potential partners. In the final step, for each female candidate and in the order explained above, the male candidate with the highest score is selected from the vector of available men. Finally, an \u201calignment by sorting\u201d approach is applied, whereas the cases of \u201cactual marriages\u201d are aligned with the projected figures (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dekkers et al., 2009</a>).",

Since the goal of our model is to simulate the GPG, the employment- and part-time work rate, especially of women is of particular importance. As in most European countries, the majority of men in Switzerland work full time. However, for women, the picture is a bit more complex. In the EU28, the employment rate of women on averaged 64.1% in 2019. In Switzerland in the same year, 76.3% of women were employed, making it the second highest employment rate for women compared to the European countries \u2013 only surpassed by Iceland (81.9%; <a href=\"#bib41\">FSO, 2020b</a>).

Next, given that a person works, we use the results of a logistic regression model (referring to gender, number of children below age 11 and age 15, civil status, age, and education level) and the alignment information to simulate whether the person works part-time or full-time. The third and final step then models the extent of part-time work for those that are selected to work part-time in the first step. Here we distinguish three groups i) less than 50% of full time, ii) between 50% and 69% of full-time, and, iii) between 70% and 89% of full time.

The activity rate of men is declining mainly because of demographic ageing, and partially due to increasing educational attainment levels that delay labour market entry. These developments are also at play with women, but their impacts are more than compensated by the strong increase in the activity rates of women, especially in the middle aged groups, which is driven by a rising level of education and other factors, such as measures to better reconcile work and family life, interest in careers and the need to contribute to household income (<a href=\"#bib42\">FSO, 2020c</a>).

The latter GPG can then be interpreted as a combination of the standard GPG and the gender pension coverage gap, which measures the extent to which women have their own independent access to pension system benefits (<a href=\"#bib114\">European Commission, 2018</a>). It is of course not very relevant for the pension benefit of the 1<sup>st</sup> pillar only, where the coverage gap is close to zero because persons who are not gainfully employed must also contribute to the OASI. But this is in contrast to the 2<sup>nd</sup> pillar, where the overall coverage rate is 49% in 2019 (<a href=\"#bib67\">Kuhn, 2020</a>), and we therefore can expect important gender differences.

This result may be driven by the regressive character of care credits, which dampen the GPG at the bottom of the income distribution. This is also reflected in the ratio between the pension income and the minimum pension income. The pension income of women in the first quartile is 39% above the minimum pension income, which was CHF 14,220 per year in 2020. The comparable pension income of men is 49% above the minimum pension income. The pension income of men in the top 25% is close to the maximum 1<sup>st</sup> pillar pension income, which is CHF 28,440 in 2020. For women, on the other hand, the top 25% achieve only about 84% of the maximum pension. This illustrates that the redistributive elements of the 1<sup>st</sup> pillar have a stronger impact on lower pensions, since the lowest 25% receive more than the minimum pension, but the maximum pension is reached only by the top 25% among men, but not among women. Consequently, pension inequality, as measured by the P75/P25 ratio, is also higher for men than for women.",

However, compared to 2019, the gender gap would narrow significantly in 2070 and become marginal at the top 50% income distribution. This effect is mainly due an increase in the number of women reaching a maximum pension. The 1<sup>st</sup> pillar pension income at the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile of women is 43% above the minimum pension income, for men it is 66%, which indicates that the relative income distribution at the bottom 25% of the income distribution will not change significantly.<a href=\"#fn35\"><sup>35</sup></a> However, with regard to the top 75% of income distribution, we expect that the 1<sup>st</sup> pillar pension income at the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile of women (men) is 94% (98%) of the maximum pension income, which means that almost all men and women in the top quartile would receive the maximum 1<sup>st</sup> pillar pension income, which would however, be below the risk-of-poverty threshold.

This effect may be explained by a higher share of women having tertiary educational attrition, which is associated with higher wages, leading to a reduction of the GPG in the upper income range.

The simulation results suggest, that women at the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile receive 46.5% of the pension benefit of men, which is only a slight decrease of the GPG down from 50.1 (see <a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a>). However, as 2<sup>nd</sup> pillar pension entitlements are strongly related to lifetime income, this differences reflecting men\u2019s higher lifetime income. This effect is aggravated as women, who work part-time and have low salaries are more strongly affected by the income threshold (coordination deduction) for contributive income. However, in 2070 the coverage rate of the 2<sup>nd</sup> pillar of women is almost 100%, compared to around 49% in 2020. Thus, almost all female pensioners in 2070 receive a simulated pension from the 2<sup>nd</sup> pillar, although in the first quartile the pension income of women is significantly lower than that of men. In the third quartile, however, we observe a catching up process of women. Here the GPG of the 2<sup>nd</sup> pillar pension income at the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile will decline from 36.4% in 2020 to 29% in 2070. Overall, it can be said that women are catching up, especially in the upper income brackets. This is because the intensity of work increases with higher formal education, which in turn leads to comparatively higher lifetime earnings for women.",

This effect may be driven by the fact that some of the immigrants are very well educated and can thus earn a correspondingly high lifetime income, but the higher labour market participation of immigrants is also a factor. This finding is in line with <a href=\"#bib102\">Steiner and Wanner (2019)</a>, who observe during the past decade an increased proportion of highly skilled migrants, which is driven by a shortage of human resources in some high value-added sectors, such as health, IT services and specific financial sectors.",

Thus, the share of pension income from the second pillar is 31% at the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile but 45% in the top 75% of the income distribution.

At the upper half of the income distribution, the GPG would almost disappear. Furthermore, a higher proportion of women would receive a maximum pension. This trend is also reflected in the GPG of the 1<sup>st</sup> and the mandatory part of the 2<sup>nd</sup> pillar pension income at SRA. At mean, the GPG would decline only marginal from 23.6% to 21.6%. However, at the top 25% of the income distribution, the gap would narrow significantly and decline from 23.3% to 17.6%. At the bottom 25% of the income distribution, however, the GPG would increase slightly from 23.6% to 27.5%. The catching-up process of women may be driven by two trends: first, compared to earlier cohorts, the share of women with tertiary educational attainment levels would increase, which means that their average wage would increase. This leads to a reduction of the GPG in the upper income range. However, since labour market participation and part-time employment are positively correlated with the level of education, we expect that the variance in women\u2019s lifetime earnings will also increase. Here our research confirms for Switzerland the trends found in other countries (<a href=\"#bib115\">Bonnet et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Dekkers et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Halvorsen and Pedersen, 2019</a>).",

Thus, almost all female pensioners would receive a pension from the 2<sup>nd</sup> pillar, although in the first quartile, the pension income of women would remain significantly lower than that of men. However, at the median and in the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile, the GPG would decline considerably between 2020 and 2070. The simulated 2<sup>nd</sup> pillar pension income of women at the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile would be 71% that of men, coming up from 63.6% in 2020.",

Thus, policy measures should be attempted to reduce the GPG in the lower income range. Mothers, in particular, have a low labour market intensity due to a lack of childcare options and the high cost of childcare (<a href=\"#bib8\">Budig and England, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Gash, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Guti\u00e9rrez-Dom\u00e8nech, 2005</a>). This is in line with <a href=\"#bib89\">Ravazzini (2018)</a>, who finds that an expansion in childcare places increases the working hours of mothers of 3-year-olds, whereas the impact is stronger for mothers with upper-secondary education. However, an increase in the supply of childcare places does not lead to an increase in the labour supply of low-educated or single mothers, who are the most vulnerable group because of the high costs.",

Our simulations suggest that the pension income of immigrants is slightly above that of non-immigrants across the entire income distribution. However, at the bottom of the income distribution the differences are higher than at the top, where they are marginal. This result may be explained by noting, first, that immigrants with low pension incomes are more likely to return to their country of birth, since their comparatively lower retirement income may not cover the high cost of living in Switzerland (<a href=\"#bib103\">Wanner, 2021</a>). As pensions drawn abroad are not included in the distribution of pension income in Switzerland, this may lead to a positive bias at the lower end of the distribution of pension income of immigrants. Second, the higher labour market participation of immigrants in comparison with native-borns, and their high levels of education (e.g. driven by demand in the R&amp;D and financial sectors) result in higher earnings and labour market activity rates (<a href=\"#bib62\">Hercog and Sandoz, 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">OECD, 2015</a>).

Among other things by taking a look back to analyse the employment histories of today\u2019s employed or today\u2019s new retirees. However, this requires the linking e.g. of SILC data with administrative records, as used by <a href=\"#bib67\">Kuhn (2020)</a> or else the use of statistical methods to impute retrospective data for the respondents in the 2018 SILC. In addition, the modelling of the labour supply, educational choices, and health aspects could be refined. Finally, it would be interesting to analyse in more detail the interpersonal as well as the intertemporal redistributive effects of the Swiss pension insurance system.",

The monthly median pensions were lowest among men who retired at the SRA of 65, at CHF 1,785. The picture is slightly different for women. There, median pensions from the 2nd pillar were highest among women who claimed them for the first time after the SRA (CHF 1,410), followed by new claimants who claimed them before SRA (CHF 1,321). As with men, women who claimed their first pension when they reached the SRA received the lowest pensions (CHF 990).",
