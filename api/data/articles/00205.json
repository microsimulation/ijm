                "text": "Detailed socio-demographic projections are key for policy making and planning. In this paper we introduce the dynamic microsimulation platform DYNAMIS-POP. In its core, DYNAMIS-POP is a population projection model, able to reproduce existing macro (cohort-component based) population projections in their aggregate outcomes, but with the additional possibility to simulate in more detail a variety of geographic, education, ethnicity, child mortality, partnership status, fertility and health characteristics. DYNAMIS-POP is a continuous time interacting population model implemented in Modgen, a freely available programming technology developed at Statistics Canada. The code is also x-compatible with openM++, a platform-independent open-source implementation of Modgen. All components of DYNAMIS-POP are freely available and documented on line at <a href=\"http://www.dynamis.ihsn.org\">www.dynamis.ihsn.org</a>. Most statistical analysis scripts and scripts for post-processing and visualization of the results are implemented in R. Aiming to support portability, the model code and the R scripts are generic. Adaptation of the model to a specific country only requires adapting a single setup script and simulation module. The model is provided with test data of an imaginary country. Required data are available for most developing countries. To date, the model was tested using data from Mauritania, Nepal and Senegal. Designed as a modular and versatile microsimulation platform, DYNAMIS-POP can be adapted for a variety of applications related to population issues, education and health. In this paper we give an illustration from a study on child vaccination in Nepal.",

Given the high importance of education on human capital and its influence as the \"single most important variable besides age and sex\" on demographic behaviors (<a href=\"#bib9\">Lutz et al., 1999</a>), population projections that include education later became available for most countries, but that extension defined the technical limit of this approach.",

This approach is more complex, but it has major advantages: it produces detailed projections of a broad variety of individual characteristics, models realistic life-courses and their diversity, and supports the modeling of interactions between people as well as between people and the environment. The idea is to start with a micro-data population and make it evolve over time, unlike the cohort-component approach, which starts with a simple distribution of a population by age and sex but cannot track individuals over time. The idea is not new (<a href=\"#bib20\">Van Imhoff and Post, 1998</a>), but it has become feasible and affordable only recently with the availability of free programming technologies and improvements in data availability and accessibility. Still, applications so far were limited to the developed world. The most prominent example is Demosim, the microsimulation population projection model developed and used by Statistics Canada to project the Canadian population by visible minority group (<a href=\"#bib5\">Caron-Malenfant et al., 2010</a>) and Aboriginal identity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Morency et al., 2015</a>), to project its labor force (<a href=\"#bib11\">Martel et al., 2011</a>), and to study the effect of educational improvements on the future size and composition of the Aboriginal labor force (<a href=\"#bib15\">Spielauer, 2014</a>). Variants of Demosim were recently developed as well for several European countries and Australia (<a href=\"#bib10\">Marois et al., 2017</a>).

Child vaccination is a standard module of DYNAMIS-POP, thus both parameter generation and module implementation are fully documented at the project website dynamis.ihsn.org.

Its static variant \u2013 tax benefit models \u2013 have become standard tools in the developed world (eg, EUROMOD; <a href=\"#bib17\">Sutherland and Figari, 2013</a>) and are increasingly established in developing countries (eg, SOUTHMOD; <a href=\"#bib7\">Decoster et al., 2019</a>). Central to dynamic microsimulation is the explicit modeling of the time dimension, following people and their families or households over time. Dynamic modeling lends itself naturally to the modeling of policies with a longitudinal component, eg, educational investments, especially in the context of general rapid social, economic, and demographic change that make it difficult to assess the contribution of individual policies to overall trends without tracking and comparing the lives of individuals who form a society. Rapid social and demographic change are typical for developing countries. This makes dynamic microsimulation a valuable tool to complement traditional evaluations of effects of development programs.",

Typical application areas \u2013 due to their longitudinal component - include the analysis of pension system adequacy and sustainability, health insurance, long-term care, and education finance. Using microsimulation in demographic projections is a recent development. Although this has been discussed in literature for two decades (eg, <a href=\"#bib20\">Van Imhoff and Post, 1998</a>), large-scale implementations are recent. Statistics Canada was the first statistical office to produce official population projections using microsimulation in 2004. Called Demosim, this model is implemented using the free microsimulation programming technology Modgen, developed and maintained by Statistics Canada. Variants of Demosim were recently developed also for several European countries and Australia (LSD; <a href=\"#bib10\">Marois et al., 2017</a>).",

                    "text": "The strengths of microsimulation do not come without limitations which affect the applicability of this approach. From a methodological point of view, the central limitation of microsimulation is that the degree of model detail does not go hand-in-hand with overall prediction power. Providing more detailed models, something at which microsimulation excels, does not necessarily mean the models are \"better.\" The ability to produce distributions comes at the price of losing predictive power in projecting means, and the ability to make very accurate statements in the short run does not necessarily lead to models that are useful for long-term projections. An analogy is weather forecasts: detailed models for the weather tomorrow, on a geographical scale, will not be of use for the projection of global climate changes over the next centuries. This also applies to socioeconomic models. The longer the time horizon and the more important the mean, the more the focus should be directed to the main driving forces and a solid theoretical foundation of these mechanisms. The reason for this can be found in what is called randomness. The main sources of randomness are parameter uncertainty, randomness originating from the sampling of the starting population, and Monte Carlo variability, as the occurrence of events in microsimulation depends, besides individual characteristics, on chance. (For an in-depth discussion of randomness in microsimulation see <a href=\"#bib20\">Van Imhoff and Post, 1998</a>). All sources of randomness will increase with the number of variables of the model. Additional variables require the modeling of additional processes with parameters usually estimated from empirical data, thus subject to parameter uncertainty. Detailed variables are frequently only available in specialized surveys of limited sample size, thus subject to sampling errors. The maintenance of additional variables in the simulation requires the modelling of additional processes, which increases the number of required Monte Carlo experiments thus adding to the Monte Carlo variability.",

                    "text": "The fundamental problem lies in the trade-off between the additional randomness introduced by additional variables and misspecification errors caused by models that are too simplified. This means that the large number of variables that models can include, which is the feature that makes microsimulation especially attractive, at some point comes at the price of randomness and a decrease in prediction power that occurs as the number of variables increases. There are two ways of dealing with this trade-off. The first is to keep models simple. The second is to combine the strengths of different modeling approaches. Not surprisingly, in many large-scale microsimulation models, some outcomes are aligned or calibrated towards aggregated numbers or projections obtained by external means. The effort to keep models simple often leads to macro models bypassing microsimulation as a modeling strategy, the choice often justified with the higher development costs of microsimulation. This choice ignores the fact that microsimulation can often reproduce the results of macro models if needed (and at comparable costs), while also allowing for step-wise refinements and removal of simplifying assumptions inherent to macro models. This is the development strategy we followed building DYNAMIS-POP. For most behaviors, model users can choose between a base version resembling existing macro projections and a refined version. In addition, results of the refined models can be aligned to the base versions thus reproducing existing macro projections for aggregate outcomes, while producing realistic life-courses and additional characteristics. This makes DYNAMIS-POP a flexible analysis and projection tool.",

It can be noted, however, that such costs are not explicit costs associated with the microsimulation itself but represent the price to be paid for informed policy making. Recent advances in data availability and standardization could turn this argument around: microsimulation can make available data more policy relevant, as it complements traditional data analysis and combines such analysis with a what-if projection tool. In the case of DYNAMIS-POP, required data are readily available for many countries.",

It also has rich table output, which can be exported to Excel. The model can generate projected micro-data files, for user-defined variables and points in time. It runs on a standard PC under Windows. The execution time of a model run depends on processor speed, population sample size, time horizon of the simulation, and the user\u2019s choice of model selection and alignment routines. A typical model run, starting from an initial population sample of 250,000 persons and a 100-year time horizon, is approximately 10 minutes. This time can increase substantially for some alignment options. As DYNAMIS-POP is an interacting population model in which all persons can communicate, there is no parallelization within a simulation run, but Modgen supports running a set of simulation runs (up to 41 replicates) in parallel. In this case, all table output is available both for each replicate and as average over replicates, and measures of Monte-Carlo variation (standard deviation, coefficient of variation) are provided automatically for each table cell. All presented simulations in this paper are based on a simulation for Nepal of 6 Mill persons (24 replicates of initially 250,000 persons each, sampled from a starting population of 2.3Mill; around 10% of the population 2001).

These problems are not specific to the use for microsimulation but become more visible than in macro projections. On issue is age heaping. For example, in the 2001 Census of Nepal, more people report an age 25 than ages 24 and 26 together. This problem is common, and frequently hidden in population projections by aggregating analysis to 5-year age groups. DYNAMIS-POP does not aggregate age, and many potential DYNAMIS-POP applications (eg, school planning) require detailed projections of the population by age. A second common problem is the under-reporting of young children. In the case of Nepal, we found the number of reported births in the past 12 months very different from the number of 0-year-old; also, the number of 10-year-old children born in Nepal reported in the 2011 census is 30% higher than the number of 0-year-old reported in the 2001 census. In a project complementary to the development of DYNAMIS-POP, we address these issues and provide open source tools (the R package SimPop, see <a href=\"#bib18\">Templ et al. (2019)</a>; and code) which allow the integration of steps to fix data issues into the workflow of model parametrization. SimPop provides routines to address age heaping by changing the reported age in some records, meeting a set of consistency criteria (eg, avoiding that the age of a primary school graduates is reduced below school leaving age). Underreporting of young children is fixed by algorithms creating synthetic records to meet a target age distribution and adding these records to plausible households (eg, households with woman having declared a birth in the past 12 months, but the baby is not reported as household member). An example for Nepal is given in the Appendix. While fixing data issues is crucial to all applications requiring a good projection of population numbers by exact age (like school planning), the application example in this paper \u2013child vaccination \u2013 was chosen also because it is relatively insensitive to these problems, at least as long as the focus is on rates, and not on absolute numbers, like required vaccines.",

Processes which can be aligned are child mortality, fertility, primary school entry, and primary school graduation. All processes of DYNAMIS-POP for which alignment is available are based on proportional models which express risks (in continuous time) or odds (for discrete time decisions) by a base factor applying to all, and a set of relative factors applying to specific population groups. The logic behind this type of alignment is to adjust base factors in a way that \u2013 for a given population composition, and when applying individual relative factors \u2013 a target aggregated outcome is reached. In this way, relative differences between population groups are maintained. Proportional models are very convenient in microsimulation. From a modeling perspective, they have the advantage that aggregate outcomes and relative factors can be estimated separately from different data sets, thereby combining the robustness of large data sets (like the Census or vital statistics) for overall outcomes with the wealth of variables offered by other sources such as surveys used to estimate relative factors. Another advantage of proportional models is that they support very intuitive scenarios, e.g. trends which apply to all population groups, and changes in relative differences, like scenarios of closing gaps between groups. (For a discussion in the context of Statistic Canada\u2019s Demosim population projection model, see <a href=\"#bib4\">Caron-Malenfant et al., 2017</a>). When estimating overall outcomes and relative differences separately, base factors still must be found which, together with the relative factors, result in the target aggregate rates for a given population composition. In the context of parameter estimation, this step is performed outside of the model. Alignment routines in DYNAMIS-POP follow the same logic as when combining estimates of aggregate targets with estimates of relative factors to one proportional model but perform the search for base factors within a simulation run. While the technical implementation of some alignment routines is complex (for a detailed documentation see project website), the mechanism has a clear statistical interpretation. All alignment is optional.",

At its core, the model is parameterized by probabilities to enter and probabilities to graduate from primary school by year of birth, province of birth, and sex, respectively. In addition, the model can introduce inter-generational transmission of education by specifying proportional factors (odds ratios) by mother\u2019s education. Users are given a choice if and how the refined model is used. One option consists in calibrating the aggregate outcomes by sex and province to the base model for all years of birth. In this case, aggregate outcomes remain the same, but the more likely children are chosen to enter and graduate from school. This might be of value when studying the school (and out of school) population by socio-demographic characteristics. The second option calibrates the model just for one birth cohort from which onward the refined module is used. All simulated future trends are then driven entirely by composition effects. These model capabilities allow educational change to be decomposed into changes stemming from inter-generational dynamics, from inter-provincial migration, and from overall trends.",

Fast demographic change, especially shifts in age profiles, make period data of limited use for modeling. For example, union formation rates decrease fast for the very young, but this observation does not necessarily mean that fewer people enter a union over the life-course, even if union formation rates are currently low at higher ages, where most people observed today have entered a union already. It is in such environment that parametric models demonstrate their power. We implemented the Coale & McNeil approach for modeling entry into first unions. The parameterization of such a model is very intuitive; parameters are the minimum age at first union formation, the average age, and the proportion of women who will eventually enter a partnership. The model was proposed by Coale and McNeil in the 1970s, based on extensive studies on the age pattern of first marriages in many countries. For the countries studied so far (Mauritania, Senegal, Nepal) we found a very good fit and clear trends. Past trends are used to inform a default scenario. These trends can easily be modified by users for creating alternative scenarios. The approach works less well for more developed countries.

E.g. <a href=\"#bib13\">Shanta and Lee (2011)</a> - based on 2006 DHS data - found that \u201e... the odds of being fully immunized for children of mothers with secondary education were 5.91 times the odds for children of mothers without any formal education [while] other measures of women\u2019s empowerment \u2013 women\u2019s age at birth of first child, gap in age between spouses, women\u2019s knowledge about sexually-transmitted diseases, their role in intra-household financial, health and mobility decisions, and their perceptions toward wife beating \u2013 were not associated with child immunization.\u201c. In explicitly modeling prenatal care as part of the immunization module, we follow Shanta &amp; Leea who found, that \"among control variables, mothers who received antenatal care were 3.31 times as likely to immunize their children as mothers who did not receive any antenatal care. Other such barriers to health service use such as cost of care, distance to health services, and quality of health services were not significant.\" (<a href=\"#bib13\">Shanta and Lee, 2011</a>, p642).",

The same holds true when comparing the two scenarios closing all regional and ethnical gaps eventually leading to immunization rates close to 95%.

Of the different scenarios, the scenario of closing all ethnical and regional gaps in immunization corresponds very closely to the observed improvements. Our analysis also shows, that composition effects \u2013 mainly due to improvements in education - alone would have increased immunization rates by 8\u00a0percent points, or around 40% of the total improvement, while 60% would not have happened without additional policies addressing the unequal access to prenatal care and immunization.",

We use the default parameterization both for the fertility module (which accounts for education) and the education model which contains a (logarithmic) trend variable informed by the recent increases observed in the data. The education variable in the staring population as well as the education models are based on Census data. A comparison of the composition of mothers by education with DHS data for 2001 and 2011 show a very good correspondence of the initial education composition at the start of the simulation as well as the projected distribution 10 years later. The first birth cohort produced in the simulation is the 2001 birth cohort.
