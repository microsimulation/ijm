We find important discrepancies between the aggregate data weighted with baseline grossing-up weights and official statistics from other sources. A number of re-weighting exercises is examined from the point of view of the accuracy of microsimulation results. We show that using a combination of variables from the data together with a small number of outcomes from the microsimulation model substantially improves the correspondence of simulation results and administrative data. While demographic re-weighting is neutral from the point of view of income distribution, calibrating the weights to adjust for income sources and tax identifiers significantly increases income inequality. We specify a number of factors which ought to be considered in the choice of weight calibration targets. Data re-weighting can substantially improve the accuracy of microsimulation but it should be used with caution.",

Due to frequent non-random survey participation this representativeness is usually less than perfect and the problems of under-representation of certain groups of the population - for example the very rich or the very poor - have been long recognized (<a href=\"#bib41\">United Nations, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Schr\u00e4pler, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Korinek <i>et al.</i>, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Riphahn &amp; Serfling, 2005</a>). As we demonstrate using the example of the Polish Household Budget Surveys, if this under- or over-representation of certain groups is unaccounted for in the process of generating population grossing-up weights, the resulting population structure may differ substantially from other official statistics and administrative records. This in turn has significant consequences for the accuracy of tax and benefit simulations using microsimulation models and thus the reliability of the models for the purpose of policy analysis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Klevmarken, 2002</a>). Because validity of any microsimulation model relies, to a large extent, on the degree of correspondence between model outcomes and administrative records, significant deviations in terms of the age or economic activity distribution, and the resulting simulation discrepancies might lead to questioning of the models\u2019 role for policy purposes. In such cases even if model calculations for each particular household are correct, the grossed-up values are bound to be wrong.",

The exercise presented in this paper serves primarily the purpose of improving consistency of microsimulation results with administrative data on aggregate tax burden and benefit expenditure. We are thus far from either questioning the general approach of the Polish Central Statistical Office (CSO) to the generation of PHBS grossing- up weights or from arguing that our approach should be applied more broadly in other applications of household micro-level data. We show, however, that a relatively simple method of data re- weighting along the lines of <a href=\"#bib11\">Gomulka (1992)</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">Deville and Sarndal (1992)</a> and <a href=\"#bib9\">Creedy and Tuckwell (2004)</a>, which has recently been applied widely in various types of micro-data analysis (e.g.: <a href=\"#bib3\">Brewer <i>et al.</i>, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Navicke <i>et al.</i>, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">O\u2019Donoghue and Loughrey, 2014</a>), can significantly improve the accuracy of tax and benefit microsimulations in many dimensions. We present different approaches to weight calibration and suggest key factors which ought to be considered in the process. Since these factors can be generalized to other datasets and countries, the analysis presented here could be applied to other data used for microsimulation purposes. We extend the weight calibration criteria which are used by the Polish CSO in three stages. In the first stage, the calibration of weights is done with respect to demographic variables (e.g.: <a href=\"#bib6\">Cai, Creedy &amp; Kalb, 2006</a>). In the second stage we additionally include the number of recipients of main income sources, while in the third use a process of \u201ccross-validation\u201d where we calibrate population weights in the data with respect to a set of tax identifiers related directly to microsimulation.",

In <a href=\"#s2\">Section 2</a> we briefly describe the Polish Household Budget Survey data used for the analysis including the sampling frame of the survey and the approach of the Central Statistical Office to the computation of population weights provided with the data, referred to as \u201cbaseline\u201d weights. Using these weights in <a href=\"#s3\">Section 3</a> we present the differences in the age distributions between the baseline PHBS data and official sources on demographics as well as the correspondence of economic status information in the data and administrative statistics. The divergence between these distributions forms the principal motivation for the weight calibration in the paper. In <a href=\"#s3\">Section 3</a> we also show how these underlying differences find their reflection in discrepancies of microsimulation results using a number of key tax and benefit parameters from the microsimulation model SIMPL which is applied to the PHBS data (see e.g.: <a href=\"#bib2\">Bargain <i>et al.</i>, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Morawski <i>et al.</i>, 2008</a>). The method of weight re-calibration, which follows <a href=\"#bib11\">Gomulka (1992)</a> and <a href=\"#bib9\">Creedy and Tuckwell (2004)</a> is briefly discussed in <a href=\"#s4\">Section 4</a>, including details on different stages of calibration and discussion of factors we consider in the process. Results of re-weighting in the form of a comparison of tax and benefit microsimulation outcomes with administrative information is presented in <a href=\"#s5\">Section 5</a>. Consistency of the grossed-up population structure in the data in terms of demographics, income sources and tax identifiers has substantial influence on the accuracy of microsimulation. We show that weight adjustments for income sources and tax identifiers have significant implications for the level and trends in inequality indicators in Poland. Conclusions including some words of caution regarding the methods applied in this paper follow in <a href=\"#s6\">Section 6</a>.",

This under-representation is as high as 21%\u201327% for years 2006\u20132010 relative to other official statistics, but falls to only about 6% in 2011. In <a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a> we can see that relative to external statistics employees are over-represented in the sample by between 10\u201315% and the self-employed are under- represented, in particular in more recent years of data. We return to these two issues in the discussion of the factors we consider in the re-weighting process in <a href=\"#s4\">Section 4</a>. The PHBS data from years prior to 2010 significantly over-represents farmers which may be caused by definitional problems in survey and administrative data, but probably reflects also the fact that weights prior to 2010 were based on the 2002 Farming Census and the structure of farming in Poland saw substantial changes since then. The data beginning with 2010, with weights based on the 2010 Farming Census and the 2011 National Census, are much closer to other administrative records on the number of farmers. In <a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a> in addition to employment status comparisons we also present the correspondence of the PHBS data with administrative records with regard to the number of recipients of the main Social Security benefits. The correspondence of these numbers to official statistics differs in different years, but the numbers are generally close. The main exception are Family Pensions, which seem to be underreported by up to 26%. The most likely reason behind it is reporting accuracy related to the precise naming of pensions, which we discuss in <a href=\"#s4\">Section 4</a>.",

In the case of each year we use the SIMPL microsimulation model to simulate the baseline tax and benefit system which operated in that year. Within the HI and PIT categories we show the total number of contributors and additionally list the numbers by those paying contributions on permanent employment and self-employment income. For PIT we also give the numbers of recipients of the Child Tax Credit, a generous tax credit for families with children introduced in 2007.",

As in the case of the employment status we overestimate Health Insurance contributions for the employees (by between 10% and 21%) and underestimate them for the self-employed (by 7%\u201317%). The number of people paying income taxes, on the other hand, overall matches relatively well with administrative statistics. However, since we are unable to account for the details of tax deductions among the self-employed, and cannot identify clearly the specific ways people file their taxes, the number of tax payers in this category is substantially higher compared to the official statistics. Given the over-representation of children in the data it is not surprising that the model significantly overestimates the number of recipients of the Child Tax Credit as well as the means-tested Family Benefits. In the latter case the basic Family Allowance is overestimated by about 32% in 2006 and by 17% in 2011, while the supplement to large families by as much as 104% in 2006 and 40% in 2011. Some of this overestimation might reflect non-take up, but the differences between supplements suggest that while the data generally over-represents families with children, it might be over-representing households with a high number of children to a much larger extent than households with one or two children.",

The latter take the National Census as the starting point and are then regularly updated from population registries. Since definitional correspondence and reporting accuracy should not be a problem when it comes to age, we use the information from external statistics and adjust the age distribution to correct the representativeness of the PHBS in each of the re-weighting stages. The only factor that might affect the validity of the comparison of age distributions is lack of coverage of individuals living in collective dwellings. These individuals are covered by general population statistics but are not present in the PHBS. However, the proportion of individuals in collective dwellings in Poland is low (according to the 2011 Census it is only about 0.95% of the overall population), and so this should not significantly affect the results, in particular that the re- weighting is done in such a way that the total grossed-up population is the same before and after adjustment.",

In this case, as in the case of age, there should be good definitional correspondence and also high reporting accuracy in the survey. However, in the case of education there seems to be a problem with reliability of external statistics which can serve as a note of caution against taking them for granted. The values for 2006\u20132010 given in Statistical Yearbooks were calculated based on the 2002 Census and updated with local registry data and educational surveys. For these years the discrepancy between the survey and external statistics for higher education is as high as 27% in 2007 (see <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a>). However, once the reference changed to the 2011 Census data, the degree of overestimation of the number of individuals with higher education in the PHBS falls to only about 6%. This suggests that for the earlier years it is the survey, rather than the (estimated) official statistics, that give a more accurate picture of the education distribution. We therefore do not use education as a weight calibration target in our analysis.",

The most likely explanation behind the differences we observe in the data is that these pensions include survivors\u2019 pensions which in the survey are likely to be declared by surviving spouses of retirement age as retirement pensions. This is consistent with the small over-representation of retirement pensions in the data and the close correspondence of survey data and external statistics when we include all the pensions together. Thus in this case, while it is possible to set the number of recipients of each individual category of pensions as target for calibration, it may be preferable to target the total number of pension recipients.",

This instance is, however, an example of potential lack of definitional correspondence with an unclear split between employees and the self-employed. In Poland many individuals, for tax optimization purposes, are officially self-employed but perform their tasks in a way which has all the features of contractual employment. In this case it is possible that in the survey they may report the latter, while in the official statistics they will figure as self- employed. Additionally, reliability of external statistics on the number of employees and self- employed combines information from another survey (the Polish Labour Force Survey) and other estimates for the national accounts, which could also be problematic. In this case we therefore decided to target outcomes which may be less prone to definitional discrepancies between the survey and official statistics and use the information on health insurance and income tax contributions matched with simulated obligations to pay these using our microsimulation model.<sup><a href=\"#fn4\">4</a></sup>",

In the case of the PHBS the data collected for a particular household covers the period of one month, and thus ideally the database should be related to external statistics expressed in (average) monthly terms. In this regard headcount measures are particularly likely to be sensitive to different time coverage. For example, in the case of the number of recipients of a particular source of income (e.g. disability pension) the survey will record information on all regular recipients but will miss some of the individuals receiving this income on irregular basis, since the data for some of such households may be collected in months when they do not receive this income. When compared to overall annual headcount data in such cases the grossed up number of recipients in the survey will be lower compared to annual external statistics. For our analysis we use a number of external (average) monthly statistics on such variables as income sources from social security and social security contributions. If such monthly statistics do not exist, as for example in the case of the number of income tax payers, we then have to rely on a comparison with annual information.",

Realizing the complexity of tax and benefit systems, we understand that this is a strong assumption, indeed an assumption which is regularly tested by comparing external statistics to the output of the models. On the other hand, such factors as closer definitional correspondence of the target variables and availability of comparable administrative information would favour using microsimulation output for re-weighting. An important issue in this regard is to choose microsimulation targets for which the risk of errors in generating the relevant information in the microsimulation model is low. If used cautiously microsimulation output could be a valuable reference for re-weighting. Below we use results of microsimulation in the third stage of re-weighting taking the number of identified individuals paying taxes or health insurance.

The additional criterion on which weights are calibrated in Stage 1 (S1) are demographic targets related to age distribution. Stage 2 (S2) extends these targets by adding seven types of basic income sources as declared in the PHBS. Finally in Stage 3 (S3), instead of these seven income sources we use two indicators for income receipt in which case there should be high degree of definitional correspondence, namely receipt of <i>any</i> social security pension and unemployment benefit, and supplement this by a number of outcome variables from the microsimulation model. These targets are the number of individuals paying Personal Income Tax and employee and self-employed Health Insurance. The starting weights for the calibration exercise are the baseline weights as provided by the CSO. Results generated using these baseline weights are labelled as S0.

In a similar way to the detailed results presented in <a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a>, for each of the years considered in the analysis we apply the baseline tax and benefit system for the given year. The differences between S0 and S1\u2013S3 in the grossed-up number of individuals in specific economic status and social security benefit receipt category as well as with regard to the simulation outputs, result purely from changes in the values of weights. The results in the form of ratios of PHBS based figures and external sources for the economic status and SSC benefit receipt are presented in <a href=\"#table6\">Table 6</a>. The amount figures for the simulated contributions and tax outcomes are shown in <a href=\"#table7\">Table 7</a>, while for Family Benefits in <a href=\"#table8\">Table 8</a>. For these parameters we also show the ratios between the simulated and administrative information for headcount and aggregate amounts in the form of radar charts in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a> (generated using radar graphs for <a href=\"#bib26\">Stata, Mander, 2007</a>). The tables and figures include the same tax and benefit outcomes as those chosen for the baseline validation presented in <a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a>. The closer the relative values are to 1, the closer are the simulated values to their administrative counterparts. The list of the tax and benefit parameters and their labels is given in <a href=\"#table9\">Table 9</a>.",

The most significant improvements apply to the Family Allowance and its supplements. The biggest relative deviation from the administrative data can be observed in the Supplement for Large Families (SLF) which is oversimulated by over 100% in 2006 in terms of the headcount measure and by 43% in terms of amount when using baseline weights. For all calibration targets in a given period the number of recipients and the aggregate value of the SLF drops substantially and gets closer to the administrative records. The headcount values are still oversimulated but by much less compared to the baseline weights. In terms of total spending most of the simulations generate results closely matching the administrative values. A similar picture can be seen for the Supplement for Starting School (SSS) in years 2010 and 2011.",

This is the result of calibrating the number of recipients of the main types of incomes in S2 and of selected types of contributions in S3. The improvements in terms of aggregate amount of contributions and taxes are less clear cut. The details are presented in <a href=\"#table7\">Table 7</a> and we can see that often, while there are improvements in terms of the numbers of contributors to Social Security, the calibrations result in slightly higher deviations in terms of aggregate amounts of Health Insurance and income taxes. The reason behind this is that when we target income sources or the number of social insurance contributions we risk lowering the weight on top income recipients in the data who generate a significant proportion of tax and contributions incomes. In <a href=\"#s5-4\">Section 5.4</a> we propose an alternative calibration approach which extends the use of microsimulation output to re-weight high income households and, as a result, produces a further improvement relative to administrative data.",

The results reflect our detailed discussion and show overall significant improvements in the accuracy of simulations, especially for Stages 2 and 3. Improvements in the aggregate measures are substantial even despite the slightly less precise results on insurance and income taxes in a number of cases. The indicator with calibrated weights is higher compared to the baseline only in the case of amounts for S1 calibrations in 2008 and 2009. These results relate to a substantial under-simulation of a number of elements of the Family Benefits system in these two years.

Important gains in the performance of the Polish microsimulation model SIMPL appear already after correcting for the distribution of age (S1), which is probably the least controversial and arbitrary adjustment. Interestingly, in our application these changes are neutral from the point of view of the overall income distribution. More detailed re-weighting using indicators related to income sources (S2) and tax identifiers (S3) result in further overall improvement of the accuracy of microsimulation, and these significantly change the distribution of income in terms of the level of inequality and also affect the pattern of changes in inequality over time.",

First of all, it is important to identify the most likely reasons for the observed discrepancies between the survey data and external statistics, in particular taking into account the way the survey weights are constructed. It needs to be noted as well that the comparison will be affected not only by the representativeness of the survey but also by such factors as accuracy of external statistics, definitional correspondence between survey data and external statistics, reporting accuracy of the survey and coverage of external data. In the Polish case as far as the age distribution is concerned, we can count on reliable and directly comparable external data, and there is also little reason for definitional discrepancy or survey reporting inaccuracies. In such cases the most likely reason for discrepancies is selective survey non-response with respect to these characteristics and the fact that baseline weights do not account for it. Adjusting the weights in such cases, in particular if it also accounts for categories taken into consideration in generating the baseline weights, seems justified, and as we saw in <a href=\"#s5\">Section 5</a>, might bring substantial gains in the accuracy of simulation results.",

This approach needs to assume accuracy of the microsimulation output at the level of individual households, and we argued that one should only use it in cases when the scope for computational error is small and when the benefits of using microsimulation output outweigh the possible costs. This will for example be the case when there are problems with finding high quality external data to compare the survey to, in particular in the case of problems with the factors outlined above. For example, in our analysis in Stage 3 of re- weighting, we only used the number of contributors to Health Insurance identified in microsimulation analysis, rather than its aggregate values. From this point of view the third stage of re-weighting might be seen as a trade-off between using more directly comparable data on contributions at the cost of having to take advantage of microsimulation information. In the extension of Stage 3 we showed that using more detailed microsimulation output, in this case the aggregate value of tax advantages from joint taxation, can bring further benefits in terms of microsimulation accuracy. In such cases however, one has to be aware that any error in microsimulation might have substantial consequences for the accuracy of the model in respects other than the targeted outcome.",

The best example of such groups in our case are farmers. The potential definitional discrepancies and lack of accuracy of external data which we discussed in <a href=\"#s3\">Section 3</a>, is the main reason why we leave them out of the calibration process, but the comparison of Stage 2 and 3 of re-weighting very clearly reflects the effects of calibrating a high number of targets (in Stage 2) on this residual group. We can see for example in <a href=\"#table6\">Table 6</a> that the second stage of the calibration has a very substantial effect on the number of farmers in the data, with much less pronounced implications of using the smaller set of calibration targets under Stage 3.",

Various approaches to re-weighting are possible and some of them will have substantial consequences for the resulting distribution of income in the survey data and the implied levels and trends in inequality. Such differences in the distribution of income resulting from re-weighting in our view deserve further careful analysis.",
