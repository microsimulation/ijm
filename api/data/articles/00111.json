                "text": "A well-known challenge for developers and users of dynamic microsimulation models is the question of credibility, the so-called black box problem. Several strategies have been proposed to validate models. They typically involve comparing the results of a simulation run to other suitable figures. This paper approaches the issue after a considerable time lag and uses empirical data for a retrospective comparison. The validation is concerned with the German AVID model, or more precisely, with the basic employment histories module of the model. The model uses survey data and process-generated data on app. 12 000 Germans to project future employment histories and future old age incomes. After seven years the original respondents were surveyed again so that it is possible to compare their simulated and empirical employment histories. Several aspects regarding desired properties of the simulation results and the characteristics of employment histories are discussed. They include global indicators like cross-sections on the aggregate level, cumulative values on the individual level, and structural indicators on the individual level. The results of the comparison are generally encouraging. On the aggregate and cumulative level there is a very good resemblance. Substantial deviations are only found on the individual, structural level: The empirical employment histories are much more continuous than the simulated ones. This overestimation of complexity can be explained by the developments in the time period used for the estimation of the model parameters, but it still leads to a general underestimation of social inequality in the simulation results.",

While the model is still under construction it can be helpful to run it for a time in the past, <i>i.e.</i> the time period which the parameters are derived from. Another approach along these lines could be to divide the data in halves and use the parameters from the training set to reproduce the results in the comparison set.

A state-directed economy with low productivity was transformed into a market economy in a very short time. This transformation entailed a fast process of privatisation and deindustrialisation. Many companies were closed down and unemployment, which had virtually been non-existent in the GDR, became a widespread phenomenon. Furthermore, qualifications acquired in the GDR were often useless in the new economic environment so that people were forced to re-train if they were young enough, take early retirement or remain in long-term unemployment (<a href=\"#bib2\">Diewald, Goedicke and Mayer 2006</a>).",

The projected distribution of states mirrors the empirical distribution of states almost exactly with an average deviation of only 1 percentage point (maximum 3 percentage points).

This is most certainly due to the developments in the base period: Here, we observe an increasingly higher share of unemployment over the years which is even higher than the share of this SES in the projection. This phenomenon and how the model was restricted to not pick up the full extent of this development is discussed further with the groups specific results for East Germany. With SES Other there are also similar differences between projection and empirical data. Most probably this is due to the empirical increase in marginal employment, but since this is a category which comprises several different SES a substantial explanation is difficult.",

The projected average values, which are most commonly considered when validating a model, fit very well with the empirical data. The deviation between the projected and empirical shares is only 1 percentage point on average. If we consider the structure of the employment histories though, we find bigger differences. The projection spread the SES over too many individuals and thus underestimated the stability of employment histories and the amount of inequality. This phenomenon is apparent in all the subgroups considered, but it is especially pronounced for East German men and women whose life courses are more challenging to project due to a strong period effect.",

We can get a feeling for the importance of the specification of the base period by comparing the results for East and West Germany. While the 1990ies were turbulent times for the whole of Germany, the East of the country underwent a complete transition. At the end of the decade just about everything had changed: the political system, the economic system, the labour market, and the educational requirements for successful participation in the labour market. This means that East Germans had very continuous employment histories as a legacy of the state-directed economy which were interrupted quite suddenly for a big part of the population. As expected, the comparisons presented above show clearly that the projection was much closer to the empirical data for West Germany than for East Germany and we observe the highest deviation between projection and empirical data for East German men for whom the changes were most pronounced. However, considering the vast and sudden changes, the projection for East Germany was not very far off the empirical mark either. As far as the validation process is concerned, the AVID model seems to be quite robust which suggests that while the choice of base period does matter it is only one part of the model set-up.",
