                "text": "This article conducts an exploratory review of the decision to retire in microsimulation models (MSM) by asking two research questions: Which theoretical and methodological approaches from the scientific literature on retirement are used in MSM? What is the theoretical and methodological quality of those models? Retirement is a central topic in microsimulation. The knowledge about the concrete way in which the transition probabilities of retiring are modelled is, however, scattered across the individual MSM\u2019s documentation. This review constitutes a first attempt at centralising the available knowledge. It has three main objectives: to link the treatment of retirement in the MSM tradition to the broader theoretical and methodological paradigms governing the study of retirement decisions, to deepen the knowledge basis on MSM, and to encourage further discussion and knowledge-sharing about how retirement decisions are modelled in MSM. Using the systematic review methodology first outlined by <a href=\"#bib133\">Moher et al. (2009)</a>, a general analysis including 32 models was conducted, after which 26 models were examined in detail. The review found a relatively uniform application of econometric methods when estimating retirement decisions, whereas some theoretical frames and variables are less well-represented.",

If retirement is assumed to be a non-absorbing state, the question arises as to whether the retirement decision may be regarded as indistinguishable from other decisions concerning labour-market supply (e.g., the decision to work or not to work). If this is the case, the variables influencing that transition will likely be the same as those influencing the labour-market supply during earlier life phases. Empirically, retirement as a non-absorbing state has been linked to Anglo-Saxon countries (cf. infra). However, the emergence of part-time retirement schemes and an increase in the number of working retirees in some European countries, such as Portugal (<a href=\"#bib38\">Eurofund, 2012</a>), have produced an overlap between work and retirement elsewhere.

Structural models attempt to grasp the entire environment within which a particular phenomenon occurs. Conversely, reduced-form equations focus on policy evaluation and the effect of specific treatments (i.e. policy interventions) on the behaviour of rational agents, often exploiting discontinuities in policies to create quasi-experimental settings in which they compare identical observations to assess the treatment variable\u2019s effect (<a href=\"#bib77\">Manoli and Weber, 2011</a>). The variables used do not correspond precisely to the operationalisation of concepts such as utility or leisure preferences (<a href=\"#bib25\">Dahl et al., 1999</a>). Applied to the context of retirement, an example of a structural model is that of <a href=\"#bib54\">Gustman and Steinmeier (2008)</a>, in which married men are assumed to maximise their expected utility in accordance with the value they attach to consumption and leisure, subject to an asset constraint defined by the return rate, wages, their partner\u2019s income (treated as exogenous), pension benefits and consumption itself. All parameters related to these variables are then estimated using the Generalised Method of Moments.

There is, however, a significant difference between countries regarding the number of models and their complexity. <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a> displays the number of models by country. Source: own elaboration. Most countries are represented by one or two models. Canada, the US, the UK, France and Italy seem to display a more complex landscape, with the two latter countries displaying the richest microsimulation tradition (as it will become apparent below, their models may also be counted among the most complex).

Even though nearly every MSM is developed as a stand-alone piece of software, often with its own language and conventions, some entities provide platforms to construct new models using their ad-hoc developed tools. Some examples are: the MicSim package in R (<a href=\"#bib129\">), the MODGEN language, a C++-related microsimulation package (<a href=\"#bib22\">Charette and Hicks, 2017</a>), the LIAM (<a href=\"#bib85\">), LIAM2 (<a href=\"#bib17\">), and UMDBS (<a href=\"#bib104\">Sauerbier, 2002</a>) software. This interrelatedness leads to a complex model genealogy. For example, the software LIAM2 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Bryon et al., 2018</a>) lies at the basis of the Belgian MIDAS, which shares ancestry with the Italian T-DYMM (<a href=\"#bib20\">Caretta et al., 2013</a>). MIDAS has been applied in the German and Italian contexts as well (<a href=\"#bib29\">), and has served as a template for models in Portugal (<a href=\"#bib82\">Moreira et al., 2019</a>), Luxemburg (<a href=\"#bib30\">Dekkers and Desmet, 2018</a>), Hungary (<a href=\"#bib31\">Dekkers et al., 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Dekkers et al., 2015b</a>), Slovakia (<a href=\"#bib117\">\u0160tef\u00e1nik and Miklo\u0161ovi\u010d, 2020</a>), and Switzerland (<a href=\"#bib66\">Kirn and Baumann, 2021</a>) as well as for the French AGIRC/ARRCO (<a href=\"#bib34\">Direction technique AGIRC-ARRCO, 2020</a>). The MODGEN software has been used to build the Spanish DyPeS and the Slovenian DyPenSI. The JAS-mine engine has been used to develop LABSim and the Labour Participation Model, which was created for the European Fund for Living and Working Conditions (<a href=\"#bib94\">Richiardi and Richardson, 2015</a>). DESTINIE is the basis for several other French models (such as <a href=\"#bib24\">Cuvilliez and Laurent, 2016</a>). The British NIBAX (<a href=\"#bib126\">van de Ven, 2011</a>) forms the basis of the Italian NIBAX-ITALISSIMO, and the Italian ANAC model (<a href=\"#bib84\">O\u2019Donoghue, 2001</a>) uses the same estimators for transition probabilities to retirement as the Italian DYNAMITE model. Likewise, the administrative and academic fields may also be interrelated: the Irish Life-cycle redistribution in the Irish Tax-Benefit system \u2013 the Irish Dynamic Cohort Microsimulation Model - was first developed as a PhD project and is built on LIAM, which is different from LIAM2 and is itself the basis for several other models (<a href=\"#bib85\">O\u2019Donoghue et al., 2009</a>).",

The use of administrative and survey data is almost evenly distributed among those MSM with observed starting populations. Four models use a combination of both sources. Large samples representative of the national populations are nearly pervasive, although there may be restrictions regarding age, e.g. only citizens in the working age groups may be included. A smaller sample is used by the IFS model (UK).

For DyPeS, the developers (<a href=\"#bib88\">Patxot et al., 2018</a>) underline the trade-off between theoretical complexity and practical feasibility, and attempt to balance both elements by embedding their survival approach into the US tradition of reduced-form econometric models. CERPSIM3 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Borella and Moscarola, 2010</a>) is entirely based on previous theoretical work (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belloni and Alessie, 2009</a>), and PENSIM (<a href=\"#bib60\">Holmer et al., 2016</a>) reflects upon the trade-offs between structural and reduced-form models. The documentation of four models (LABSim, IFS model, PRISME and SESIM III) does not explicitly address theory but concentrates on the MSM literature.",

The MSM under analysis fall into three groups: those sourcing their transition probabilities from existing distributions, those calculating those probabilities as part of the model, using regressions, and those that leave it to the user to input the transition probabilities from an unspecified source. The first group sources the probability distributions from either other models or empirical distributions. The (often) logistic regressions in combination with a stochastic element determine the a priori risk of the event happening, and the alignment tables determine the number of events actually happening. The Belgian MIDAS model uses alignment-by-sorting based on another model. It first estimates the number of pensioners by importing the transition probabilities from the MALTESE system of meso-economic models (<a href=\"#bib31\">Dekkers et al., 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Dekkers et al., 2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Fasquelle et al., 2012</a>).<a href=\"#fn17\"><sup>17</sup></a>; These probabilities are defined by recent retirement behaviour and historical participation rates (<a href=\"#bib31\">Dekkers et al., 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Dekkers et al., 2015b</a>) and make distinctions along the gender, age, pension scheme and socio-economic category variables. The MIDAS population is then sorted according to the probabilities. The alignment happens by \"retiring\" the same percentage of individuals who are retired in the MALTESE model from the sorted population.",

Whereas the probit model uses the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF) as the basis to rescale probabilities, logit models use the logistic CDF. They produce similar results, but the latter technique is often preferred because of the more straightforward interpretation of its estimates (i.e. odd ratios). The discrete hazard model used by DyPeS aims to calculate the time until an event (the retirement decision), and it essentially amounts to a series of logit models for which a time variable held constant within each logit dictates the baseline hazard. The continuous hazard model allows the modelling of hazards in a single equation, but relies on additional assumptions regarding the shape of the baseline hazard across time.",

Otherwise, the use of alignment as an improvement mechanism for the results of retirement estimations is not generally used in the studied models, although it is widely present in demographic modules. There are a few exceptions. The transition probabilities in MIDAS (cf. supra), ELSI and PROMESS are by default aligned with other models. The IFS Model applies alignment by sorting (cf. supra, MIDAS model), in which people are moved from one category of the labour force to another in the order of their transition probabilities until the simulation results have been aligned to historical survey data. APPSIM offers optional alignment with labour force participation statistics but goes a step further by introducing some stochasticity: it selects a proportion of people for whom transition probabilities are inverted, and then applies alignment by sorting (<a href=\"#bib57\">Harding et al., 2009</a>). DyPenSI offers optional alignment too (Nata\u0161a Kump, personal communication, 2019, 2022).",

Therefore, it may be seen as detrimental to a model\u2019s methodological quality. On the other hand, if appropriately used as an alternative scenario in validation strategies, it can help to identify flaws in the estimations, as in the case of DyPenSI. Four arguments justify the case for alignment. First, the long simulation periods for which transition probabilities are calculated are based on either cross-sectional or short panels, requiring some correction for a changing context. Second, if the transition probabilities produced by logit or probit regression models are far from the centre of the distribution, the simulation may produce poor results, creating a need for tweaking. Alignment makes this tweaking explicit. It is moreover efficient because it allows to incorporate tacit knowledge that otherwise remains out of reach. For example, if a certain technique is better at modelling certain phenomena than MSM, alignment may be used as a vehicle to incorporate it into a MSM model. Third, alignment helps to provide a consistent message to policy makers and other stakeholders dealing with different models.",
