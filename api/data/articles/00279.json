She was funded by a Commonwealth Government scholarship to undertake a PhD at the London School of Economics, where she developed a tax/transfer microsimulation model for Australia. She was supported by the Hon. Brian Howe, a Labour government minister at the time. On her return to Australia in 1993, she left the APS and founded the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM) at the University of Canberra, with a focus on developing microsimulation models. She continued to work closely with Australian Federal Government departments including Treasury, the Department of Social Security, the Department of Education, and others.",

This was then the starting point for the International Microsimulation Association (IMA), which had its first official conference in Vienna in 2007, with Ann as the President. The International Journal of Microsimulation was also launched at this IMA conference (<a href=\"#bib50\">Harding, 2007</a>). Following this IMA conference, the Association has had a world forum every 2 years; and European meetings every other year.",

Brian Howe was formerly the Minister for Social Security when NATSEM was first proposed by Ann, and subsequently Australia\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services. As Ann knew, Howe was a strong advocate of the need to better understand and improve the economic and social circumstances of disadvantaged groups across Australia. Accordingly, he was approached and responded extremely positively to Ann\u2019s arguments about NATSEM\u2019s potential value and effectively enabled the Centre, with the Federal Government providing an initial 5 years of core funding. At the same time Ann also approached Don Aitken, then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Canberra\u2019s, and he responded very positively to Ann\u2019s suggestion that the proposed Centre be part of the University. As the critical importance of maintaining Ann\u2019s commitment to the proposed Centre was recognized, it was proposed that responsibility for the Centre should be jointly held by Ann and the University, so that it would be co-owned.

Ann had determined that STINMOD would be critical in enabling NATSEM to comprehensively research the combined effects of current and proposed taxation and social welfare costs and payments. Accordingly, this was a task she directed be undertaken and given precedence by NATSEM\u2019s earliest researchers. The building of the Centre\u2019s first microsimulation model was successfully achieved by the second half of 1994. From then on STINMOD remained a critical component of many of the Centre\u2019s research projects and was made available to other academic and government researchers, while its capabilities continued to be progressively updated and extended.

However, the Government wanted to know what the impact of income contingent loans and grants had on returns to higher education over a lifetime. As Ann had developed the HARDING dynamic microsimulation model as her PhD, it was used to model the returns to education over a lifetime. However, the main contribution of the model was the ability to test different fee and loan/grant scenarios and show the impact, which ranged from no fees or loan to partial fees and commercial loan.

Up to the 1990s, health - usually represented by disability status \u2013 was typically included as a simple covariate in some large scale general purpose economic microsimulation models and was often treated in a very cursory manner. The models and applications mentioned briefly below are a testimony to Ann\u2019s vision of having dedicated health models (or dedicated modules in larger models). These aimed to address the urgent policy needs of the Australian Government as well as State and Territory Governments, and in keeping with Ann\u2019s views on inclusivity in the use of NATSEM\u2019s models, also the needs of commercial industry partners and not-for-profit community organisations. Ann wasn\u2019t daunted by the challenges presented in developing these models - they were much more complex in their handling of health, disability, population ageing, funding and service provision arrangements of the health, disability and aged care systems, and in the evaluation of treatment and care options. Creating the base datasets upon which the microsimulation models could be constructed was extraordinarily difficult because of the lack of micro-level data, but Ann had complete confidence in her staff to overcome any barriers. Early health models pioneered the use of health-specific microdata for base populations in models of private health insurance and public hospital and pharmaceutical expenditure (PLM-PB) along with related distributional and lifetime analysis ((<a href=\"#bib72\">Percival et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Schofield, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Schofield, 1998</a>).

MediSim was designed in partnership with Medicines Australia (the peak body representing the medicines industry of Australia) to simulate current and future use and costs of PBS subsidised medicines, under existing PBS and different policy settings, and the distributional effects of policy changes estimated. The model generated PBS government outlays and consumer costs based on various script volume, drug price, patient copayment and safety net assumptions, as well as estimating the corresponding effects on families belonging to various income and household groups (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abello and Brown, 2007</a>).",

The model had the capacity to assess the likely distributional impact of possible policy changes and their revenue or expenditure implications for Government as well as individuals and families.

STICERD was an incredible place with a whole range of stars of social policy and inequality such as Tony Atkinson, Howard Glennerster, Julian Le Grand, Nicholas Barr, David Piachaud, John Hills, Frank Cowell, Holly Sutherland, Jane Falkingham, Paul Johnson, Maria Evandrou, John Micklewright, and visitors like Francois Bourguignon and Jane Waldfogel amongst many others. It was such an exciting place in what was then a relatively ramshackle building compared to the glitzy new LSE.

Jane Falkingham and John Hills (<a href=\"#bib37\">Falkingham and Hills, 1995</a>) had been working on a similar question at the time for the UK, developing the LIFEMOD model and so there was a team of people working on similar questions at the same time.",

Having worked on static microsimulation modelling at the ESRI, I thought that working on dynamic microsimulation modelling would be interesting and topical. I was heavily influenced by Ann\u2019s working paper on the prospects for dynamic microsimulation models in her <a href=\"#bib42\">Harding (1990)</a> STICERD Discussion Paper. In the era before the International Journal of Microsimulation or the proliferation of journals like the Journal of Economic Inequality, Discussion Paper series such as that of the Welfare State Programme at the LSE were a primary source of research output, particularly for technical discussions that were often not published in journal articles. I aspired to do similar work to Ann and her colleagues at the LSE and in 1995 enrolled in the PhD programme there with Ann\u2019s colleague Jane Falkingham as well as Celia Phillips as my supervisors. My own work is thus a direct linear descendent. Although, we did not overlap at the LSE, Ann had just published her monograph based upon her PhD (<a href=\"#bib44\">Harding, 1993a</a>) and she had just started NATSEM who were producing technical papers from the next Ann Harding inspired dynamic microsimulation model, DYNAMOD (<a href=\"#bib27\">Antcliff et al., 1996</a>). I also started working in Cambridge with another of Ann\u2019s early career colleagues Holly Sutherland as well as her supervisor Tony Atkinson. So although we had not actually met at this stage, her influence on me was diffused through very many different sources. It was thus natural for me, with similar aspirations and data constraints as Ann and colleagues at the LSE to undertake similar research based upon a Dynamic Cohort Microsimulation modelling framework. Other similar analyses and model developments occurred at the same time in Italy (<a href=\"#bib31\">Baldini, 1997</a>) and Sweden (<a href=\"#bib39\">F\u00f6lster, 1997</a>). Indeed, Baldini also heavily cites Ann Harding in his book. Another cohort model was developed in Australia around this time, but it took a different approach to the Harding inspired models (<a href=\"#bib65\">van de Ven, 1998</a>).",

Academics naturally tend to want to do an outstanding job in their modelling work \u2014 and this often means that the earlier stages of a project absorb a greater than anticipated share of the total time and budget for the project. The end result is that important processes that were part of the original project scope often then do not get included within the model \u2014 or they get included in a much more rudimentary way, or they are less well documented or validated or, by the time the model is completed, there are no more funds left to produce the papers that illustrate the useful questions that the model can answer (and thus to keep stakeholders and future funders engaged).\u2018Today, I would place a much greater importance on developing the simplest possible (but functioning) version of a model, on getting that well documented and on producing papers containing illustrative results within the project budget and timeframe.

Such an approach militates against the taking of risk\u2026 But it seems to me to better reflect the reality of research funding today, given the very high costs associated with the construction of dynamic microsimulation models.\u201d",

Her works were initially remote from the area that I as dealing with. Nevertheless, I have worked using survey data at household level. Microeconometrics and Agent Based Modelling were not too far distant from my knowledge. This knowledge shaped my perspective of what I think was Ann\u2019s contribution in the field of microsimulation. When I first learned about STINMOD and then co-supervised a student with Ann, I could see that the concept of her works was to start simple but be ready for greater complexity. Compared to the work I did with survey data before my time at NATSEM, Ann\u2019s work started with the direct and static impact of policy rather than the relationship, interaction and causality among the observation and variables. While starting with the direct static impact, Ann\u2019s works are full of details. The details are both in the data and policy application. The dynamic aspects were usually added with the necessary caveats around it. This approach can be seen since her earlier work (such as <a href=\"#bib46\">Harding, 1995a</a>).",

Besides the earlier example on the higher education funding scheme, this can be seen clearly in the development of STINMOD that is followed by CAPITA, which is currently used by the Australian Treasury. The model is being built using several modules and then combined to create a system that mimics the complicated Australian budget system. This application in a real life or policy setting was very important for Ann and I believe, this was the reason why Ann\u2019s work made such a significant contribution. Hence, her contribution was more on how the models could contribute and be applied by policy makers. We often discussed what the model can offer and what the actual need of the end users was and then how it would contribute to the broader community.
