                "text": "In this paper, we utilize Teagasc National Farm survey data to analyse the agricultural land rental market in Ireland with a newly developed agent-based microsimulation (ABM) model and a classical walrasian equilibrium model of the land rental market. We conclude that the microsimulation model has a number of strengths in addressing the interactions between landowners and tenants and dealing with the impact of economic changes on the farm size concentration. The equilibrium model retains some value in dealing with the question of price determination and in illustrating the potential surpluses to be gained from a more active land rental market. The paper contains a comparison of simulation results from the ABM model with recent farm-level data and Census of Agriculture data. These comparisons indicate the relevance of some findings from the simulation model including the rise in average dairy farm size and the decline in area allocated to non-dairy cattle farming. However, the sheep farming system appears to have defied the predictions from the simulation model and this may be attributed to the recent improvement in economic performance for this sector. The ABM model can be further refined to account for decisions in relation to the choice of farming system, the question of retirement and farm exit.",

This pattern of agricultural land transfer remains largely evident in Ireland as land inheritance continues to account for the main source of agricultural land mobility (<a href=\"#bib24\">Duesberg et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Leonard et al., 2017</a>). Agricultural land-use decisions remain strongly influenced by motives not directly related to the profits from agriculture (<a href=\"#bib38\">Howley et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bradfield et al., 2020</a>). However, there is growing evidence of an increase in profit maximization behaviour through greater activity in the medium and long-term leasing of farmland from about 2015 onwards (<a href=\"#bib72\">Revenue, 2021</a>). A continuation of this trend could significantly reduce the role of land inheritance in agricultural land mobility.",

Recent research concludes that the participation in agricultural land rental markets is associated with higher profitability among dairy farms in Ireland (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bradfield et al., 2020</a>). A more active land rental market may therefore have some implications for farm profitability and the size distribution of farms in Ireland.",

The farm equilibrium modelling approach can perform well in visually illustrating the potential gains from trading in the agricultural land rental market.

A distinction is made between landowners who are willing to rent out land and tenant farmers who are willing to rent-in additional plots of land.",

Using a balanced panel and fixed 2017 sample weights, the increase in average farm size is just 3.3 hectares. However, it is important to take into account the change in sample weights as these capture the change in the actual size distribution over time as indicated by the Census of Agriculture. Relative to the simulation results, the changes in average farm size appear smaller for both cattle and sheep systems. Sheep farming has improved significantly in terms of economic performance since 2017 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dillon et al., 2022</a>) and this may be a factor in the expanding farm size. The results for the tillage system may be influenced by a relatively small sample size and changes in the composition of the sample. We do not report the results for the Other category due to the small sample size. Under the balanced panel, the average tillage farm is slightly larger (2.6 hectares) in 2020 relative to 2017.

The 2016 Farm Structures Survey showed 78,300 farms in specialist beef production but this declined to 74,159 in the 2020 Census of Agriculture. At the same time, the total number of sheep farms has increased from 15,100 in 2016 to 17,435 in 2020. A combination of farm exits and a change in farming systems are probably contributing to the actual decline in agricultural area associated with non-dairy cattle farming.",

However, the results are very striking in showing the large changes in land area by farming system from 2010 to 2020. Over this ten-year period, there has been a 15.2 per cent increase in the land area for specialist dairy farming and a 7.4 per cent decrease in the area allocated to specialist beef production.

The simulation results are somewhat sensitive to the choice of the upper threshold, which restricts larger farms from entering the market. The gini coefficient is three to four points lower in some regions if we apply an upper threshold of 90 hectares for dairy and livestock farms.

The demand curve shows that many of the bidders in this market would be willing to pay amounts in excess of \u20ac600 per hectare for land.",

The findings from the microsimulation model indicate that a continued increase in profit maximization behaviour in the land rental market could lead to a sizeable shift in farming activity away from the non-dairy cattle and sheep farming systems to the dairy farming system with significant increases in farm size concentration. Census of Agriculture data for 2010 and 2020 shows that a significant shift in agricultural area has already occurred in terms of the area allocated to each of the main farming systems. Since 2016, it appears that the average dairy farm size has increased but with limited increases in the national share of farmland allocated to dairy farming. This can be explained by the exit of some dairy farms and the letting out or sale of these farms to other dairy farms. For expanding dairy farms, this source of additional farmland may be limited in the future and could force a greater reliance on renting or purchasing land from cattle and sheep farms.",

This would occur with a rise in the rental share from approximately 20 per cent to 30 per cent of total utilizable agricultural area. The results contain some caveats. Some increase in the rental share could occur as a result of farmer retirements and farm exits and these are excluded from the ABM model. The simulated changes in the farm size distribution may also involve significant economic mobility in some regions. The distribution of farmland could follow a more meritocratic form where the land market becomes more influenced by profit maximization. In some areas with high land quality, the changes to the distribution could be mildly progressive where farm size growth favours initially small to medium sized farms.",

Although not modelled explicitly, the findings suggest that older farmers with no successor may find the option of letting out good quality land appealing. The results suggest that the strength of the case for a more active land rental market is place dependent with less evidence in support of a more active land market in areas of medium land quality. Evidence from the 2020 Teagasc National Farm Survey data indicates that the increase in farm size concentration is largely occurring in areas of good quality land with limited changes in areas of medium quality land.",

The simulation results point to a small increase in land area for the tillage sector, which can be partly attributed to relatively lower labour costs and lower building costs associated with expansion of the land area. A comparison of 2016 Farm Structures Survey data and 2020 Census of Agriculture data shows that many of these trends are taking place albeit at a slower pace. There is an important exception in sheep farming, where the land area is actually expanding. This trend is a possible result of a notable improvement in economic conditions for the sector in recent years.",

In addition, the potential for farmers to change their farming system could have implications for the land rental market and the farmland distribution. Targeted changes to the system of farm subsidies could also have some implications for land rental markets both in terms of land rental prices and the farmland distribution.
