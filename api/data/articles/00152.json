Where uncertainty is considered sufficiently important to warrant a central place in a structural model, then dynamic programming methods are now commonly employed. Studies of savings behaviour in this vein often limit the computational burden by focussing upon the evolving circumstances of individual birth cohorts. The computational advantage that is gained by limiting a dynamic programming model to focus on a single birth cohort is, however, off-set by at least two attendant complications. The first is that the savings behaviour of a single birth cohort is only revealed over a substantial period of time, which complicates the task of capturing time-varying incentives described by the evolving economic context. Furthermore, it is questionable whether empirical results obtained for a single birth cohort will generalise to the wider population. This paper reports empirical results for a dynamic programming model that avoids both of these problems by projecting the circumstances of a population cross-section through time, which permits identification of saving preferences on cross-sectional survey data. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility and advantages for empirical analysis of the cross-sectional approach for modelling savings decisions in context of uncertainty.",

Focussing upon the evolving circumstances of a single birth cohort is a useful way for empirical studies to cut through this complexity, as age, time and cohort effects are then described by a single dimension. Such a simplification is particularly appealing where the central subject of interest is complex, as is often the case for decision problems that have no closed form solution. This is a principal reason why the dynamic programming literature that explores savings behaviour in the context of uncertainty has focussed predominantly upon empirical analysis of cohort-specific structural models, following the seminal study by <a href=\"#bib23\">Gourinchas and Parker (2002)</a>.",

An obvious choice is to parameterise a cohort-specific model with reference to data observed for a single birth cohort (<a href=\"#bib6\">O. Attanasio, Low, &amp; Sanchez-Marcos, 2005</a>).<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> This approach imposes a somewhat heavy burden on the time-frame of survey data required for analysis, and is usually complicated by the associated difficulty of obtaining an adequate description of the evolving policy context. An additional problem is that it is uncertain how far results obtained for a single birth cohort can be generalised to the wider population. These drawbacks stem from fundamental features of the empirical problem in relation to savings behaviour. An empirical analysis of savings decisions in context of uncertainty requires for identification data observed for an appreciable period of life. The longer is the period from which data for analysis are drawn, the greater is the scope for substantive variation of the policy environment underlying observed behaviour. The greater is the variation of the policy environment over multiple dimensions, the stronger is the proposition that such variation is likely to be an important determinant of observed behaviour.",

Obtaining comprehensive (pseudo) panel data regarding all of these factors usually represents a significant challenge, and integrating these data into a structural model in a coherent fashion is more challenging still. Furthermore, allowing for such variation can work to off-set any computational advantage that is derived from focussing on the circumstances of a single birth cohort. I am not aware, for example, of any dynamic programming model of household sector savings that includes an explicit account of reforms to tax and benefits policy implemented during the period of estimation.<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> Such complications hamper efforts to reflect adequately the savings and employment incentives that individuals face.",

Attanasio, Low, and Sanchez-Marcos (2008)</a>). Such an approach complicates the challenges involved in adequately describing the evolving policy context. Alternatively, empirical techniques can be used that are designed to estimate age-specific moments which control for time and cohort effects (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sefton, van de Ven, &amp; Weale, 2008</a>). Collinearity between age, cohort and time effects requires an additional restriction to permit identification. One common restriction, suggested by <a href=\"#bib15\">Deaton (1997)</a>, is to assume that time effects average out over the long run. This assumption produces estimated age profiles that represent an average taken over all cohorts included in the panel data used for estimation. The averaging that such methods apply obscures the nature of the underlying policy environment, so that it is difficult \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 to ensure that the assumed structural specification provides an adequate representation of the incentives underlying observed behaviour.",

Focussing on cross-sectional data limits the incentives underlying observed behaviour to those that applied at a single point in time, which are relatively simple to document. The drawback of this approach, however, is that strong assumptions are required to derive a stylised relationship between the characteristics of the population cross-section and those of a single birth cohort; assumptions that are unlikely to hold in practice.<sup><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup>",

This proposition is based on the observation that an OLG structural model can describe behaviour observed throughout the life-course at a single point in time, albeit for individuals drawn from different birth cohorts. If it is assumed that preference parameters are stable across generations, then this implies that the parameters of an OLG modelling approach can be identified entirely on cross-sectional survey data. This simplifies both the task of gathering the data necessary for empirical analysis, and the model description of the policy environment underlying the considered survey data.",

This study focusses squarely on the issue of empirical identification. The study is based on LINDA \u2013 the Lifetime INcome Distributional Analysis \u2013 model, designed to reflect the UK policy context as observed in 2011. LINDA is a full structural dynamic microsimulation model that uses dynamic programming methods to project savings and employment behaviour in a way that takes risk aversion fully into account. This makes the model particularly useful for exploring preferences concerning risk. The model accommodates a rich description of agent specific heterogeneity, and is publicly available so that results should be replicable by the reader. The analysis that is reported demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed estimation strategy in context of contemporary computing technology, and the model parameters obtained are found to relate closely to those reported in the broader empirical literature.",

Four points can be singled out here. First, the assumption of time separability suppresses behavioural persistence, and has been the subject of an extensive debate (e.g. <a href=\"#bib16\">Deaton and Muellbauer (1980)</a>, pp. 124\u20135; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hicks (1939)</a>, p. 261). Any empirical study concerned with inter-relations between decisions through time would need to consider data observed thorough time, in contrast to the cross-sectional data that are the focus of the empirical application considered here. Second, it is now increasingly common to allow preference parameters, including discount rates, to vary with individual specific characteristics (e.g. <a href=\"#bib26\">Gustman and Steinmeier (2005)</a>, who consider variation in relation to discount rates, and the relative attractiveness of alternative employment options). The associated literature suggests that suppressing this form of variation in an empirical analysis of preferences can be interpreted as a form of omitted variable bias. Third, the assumption that preferences are time consistent \u2013 as is implied by the preference relation defined by <a href=\"#eqn1\">equation (1)</a> \u2013 has been criticised for failing to reflect a growing body of empirical evidence (<a href=\"#bib48\">Thaler, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">G. Ainslie &amp; Haslam, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Green, Fry, &amp; Myerson, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kirby, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">G. W. Ainslie, 1992</a>). Adapting preferences to accommodate time-inconsistency has also been shown to affect behavioural margins that are used for empirical identification in this study (<a href=\"#bib37\">Laibson, Repetto, &amp; Tobacman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">van de Ven &amp; Weale, 2010</a>). Finally, the assumption of a CES specification for intertemporal preferences has been criticised for the restrictions that it imposes upon the relationship between relative risk aversion and the intertemporal elasticity of consumption.",

This is because relaxing the model along any one of the four points referred to above would expand the state-space and/or the number of preference parameters. Expanding the state space of the decision problem implies a (geometric) increase in the computational burden of the utility maximisation problem, which exaggerates the limitations of existing computing technology. Increasing the dimensionality of the (unobservable) preference parameters of the model places an increased burden on the data and numerical methods used for parametrisation. The preference relation defined by <a href=\"#eqn1\">equation (1)</a> is consequently a trade-off between parsimony and computational burden, which remains sensible given contemporary computing resources and the most common analyses that the model has been devised to explore.",

A similar logit equation is used to identify the incidence of mortgage holders among all home-owners. An age specific proportion of liquid net wealth is assumed to be held in housing for all home owners. Each mortgage holder\u2019s mortgage value is defined as a linear function of nonnegative (log) liquid net wealth. The slope and intercept of this function are allowed to vary between singles and couples, and the multiple is restricted to values between 0 and 20. The annual interest change on mortgage debt is evaluated by multiplying the (gross) mortgage value by an (exogenously assumed) fixed rate of mortgage interest. Similarly, gross housing wealth is assumed to attract an exogenous rate of return. Fixed rates ofreturn are applied for solving the lifetime decision problem, and year-specific rates are accommodated when projecting the population through time. The total return to gross housing wealth is then disaggregated into realised and unrealised components using an age specific ratio, based on the age of the family reference person. Rent is imputed for non-home-owners, based on the number of bedrooms required by the constituent family members: one bedroom is assumed for the reference adult and their spouse (if married); one bedroom is assumed for each dependent child aged 13 or over; and one bedroom for every two children aged under 13 years.",

These statistics indicate that, as preferences for leisure are strengthened, the proportion of the population choosing non-employment in the model during the reference cross-section rises, with relatively weak effects reported at the beginning of the simulated working lifetime (ages 20\u201329). The reduction in work that the rise in leisure implies, also reduces disposable income during the working lifetime, resulting in lower consumption. Notably, the reduction in consumption extends into early life, as individuals anticipate the influence of stronger leisure motives into the future. The reduced rates of employment result in lower rates of pension participation from age 30, as pension participation is limited to those in work in the model. In contrast, rates of pension participation early in the simulated working life are higher when alpha is exaggerated, which is again attributable to the forward looking nature of behaviour in the model.",

The higher employment generated when retirement (wage) effects are suppressed produces higher labour income, increasing disposable income, and permitting higher consumption late in life. At the same time, rates of pension scheme participation fall, as pensions can only be contributed to prior to pension draw-down, and the retirement effect on wages acts as a dis-incentive to pension draw-down.",

This increase in impatience results in higher simulated leisure (more adults not employed), higher consumption, and lower pension scheme participation throughout the simulated working lifetime. The effects on simulated leisure are most pronounced during peak working years (30\u201354), while the effects on consumption are fairly level through the life-course. An important feature of the calibration strategy adopted here is that, whereas a low value of \u03b4 can have a similar effect on leisure and pension scheme participation as a high value for \u03b1, the two parameters have opposing implications concerning consumption as indicated in Table 3.2. In practical terms, the inter-dependence of the effects on fitted moments that this discussion reveals between alternative assumptions concerning \u03b1 and \u03b4 indicates the need to iterate between the respective calibration \u2018loops\u2019 to identify a preferred parameter combination.",

This observation is consistent with the fact that both parameter alternatives weaken savings incentives, relative to the calibrated parameter combination. However, <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a> emphasises the extent to which incentives associated with the bequest motive are skewed toward later life. The influence on rates of non-employment under the \u2018low delta\u2019 simulation are highest during peak working years (30\u201354), and decline substantively into later life. In contrast, omitting a bequest motive has the strongest effects in the 55\u201374 age band. Furthermore, whereas the \u2018low delta\u2019 simulation resulted in similar increases in consumption among 3054 year-olds as among 55\u201374 year-olds, omitting a bequest motive had an impact on consumption in the age band 55\u201374 that is over 3.5 times as great as among 30\u201354 year-olds. As discussed in <a href=\"#s3-2\">Section 3.2</a>, the disproportionate influence that bequest motives have on simulated consumption late in life is exploited by the calibration strategy considered here, by jointly adjusting \u03b4 and the bequest motive to match the model to age specific means of consumption observed for the reference cross-section.",

As discussed in <a href=\"#s3-2\">Section 3.2</a>, the three parameters \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u03b6 all have an important bearing on simulated moments for both consumption and pension participation. Furthermore, the above discussion reveals that these parameters also influence preferences concerning labour supply. As the parameters adjusted in each of the calibration loops discussed above were identified taking the value of \u03b3 as given, they are re-specified in the high gamma series to clarify the effects underlying the assumed identification strategy. This involved reducing \u03b4 (implying less patience) to off-set the heightened precautionary savings motive associated with greater risk aversion. The \u03b6 parameters were increased to force down consumption late in life (where modelled uncertainty is less pronounced), and \u03b1 was reduced to off-set associated employment effects. This combination of adjustments ensures that simulated age profiles for geometric mean consumption and rates of non-employment are approximately the same as under the preferred parameter combination, as indicated by the small shifts associated with these statistics in <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a>.",

Simulated participation rates in private pensions fall by less than 10 percentage points late in the working lifetime under the high gamma scenario, which is attributable to the coincident reduction in the time at which pension wealth can be accessed and the muted uncertainty that families with older reference adults face.",

Discussion focusses upon the information used to identify unobservable model parameters, including preference parameters that are the focus of extensive empirical debate. The calibration strategy that is described is designed to identify sets of model parameters on specific \u2013 and important \u2013 behavioural moments via a hierarchical procedure. Importantly, results obtained support the proposition that preference parameters for a structural model of savings and employment \u2013 including the parameter of relative risk aversion \u2013 can be identified on behavioural margins observed for a population cross-section at a single point in time. It is argued here that the additional complications involved in extending a dynamic programming model of savings to allow for heterogenous birth cohorts are more than off-set by the conceptual advantages derived when bringing such a model to survey data.",

One such possibility is to consider whether the intertemporal elasticity of substitution exhibits systematic variation with the economic cycle. This might help to explain the wide diversity of estimates that have previously been reported for this important preference parameter, with important behavioural and policy implications. Combined with on-going improvements in that accessibility of high performance computing technology, and associated advancements in empirical methods, it is hoped that such analyses will substantively improve our understanding of the decisions that people make during the next few decades.",
