                            "text": "There is an old theoretical debate about how to mix direct and indirect taxes. In the pre-WWII era the use of indirect taxes was rejected because of its excess burdens (<a href=\"#bib66\">Marshall 1920</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Hicks 1939</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Joseph 1939</a>). After the war, in contrast, <a href=\"#bib87\">Wald (1945)</a> and <a href=\"#bib49\">Henderson (1948)</a> argued that direct taxes generate excess burdens alike when labor supply is flexible: the disincentive to work induced by direct taxation of income could be much more severe than that of indirect taxation. <a href=\"#bib21\">Corlett and Hague (1953)</a> showed that, under certain conditions, a revenue-neutral change from income taxation toward an <i>ad-valorem</i> commodity tax can increase real income. Following their famous leisure-complementarity rule the optimal tax rate increases with the degree of complementarity to nontaxable leisure. Indeed, the modern empirical literature suggests that the labor-leisure distortion is the most important feature of inefficiency (<a href=\"#bib67\">Meghir &amp; Phillips 2010</a>). The labor supply decision is distorted by both tax types, however, either via the net nominal wage or via the consumer prices in the denominator.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> Given societies do not only have efficiency concerns but also distributional aims that determine welfare, later literature combined the issue of distortions (efficiency) and social distributional preferences. The production efficiency theorem states, however, that aggregate production efficiency is a precondition of optimal taxation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Diamond &amp; Mirrless 1971</a>). There are two strands of approaches, founded by <a href=\"#bib79\">Ramsey (1927)</a> and <a href=\"#bib70\">Mirrlees (1971)</a>, that demonstrate that the optimal mix of direct and indirect taxation depends on a complex set of determinants (<i>e.g.</i>, <a href=\"#bib3\">Atkinson and Stiglitz 1976</a>). While from a theoretical point of view there might remain some justification for differentiating tax rates on different goods, the decisive reasoning for unified rates roots in administrative efficiency and tax compliance cost (<i>e.g.</i>, <a href=\"#bib46\">Harberger 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Crawford <i>et al.</i> 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ismer <i>et al.</i> 2010</a>): (i) different rates generate incentives for tax evasion strategies; (ii) differentiated rates cannot be effectively used for distributional aims, as all non-targeted households that consume the reduced-taxed goods benefit huge inefficient windfall gains. Direct taxes might appear as the more efficient instruments for distributional aims, therefore.<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup>",

These numbers differ markedly between EU members, however: the fraction of indirect taxes varies between 30% in Belgium and Germany to 54% in Bulgaria (<a href=\"#bib36\">Eurostat 2013</a>: 27). Typically, in developing and emerging economies, indirect taxes are even more important. For instance, in China the fraction of indirect taxes is about 75% (<a href=\"#bib73\">Nie &amp; Yue 2012</a>). In practice, VAT turned out to be the most important form of indirect taxation\u2014and VAT reform got a never ending policy debate worldwide. A history of the VAT is provided, <i>e.g.</i>, in <a href=\"#bib56\">James (2011)</a>. The probably first documented demand for a modern VAT was provided by Wilhelm von Siemens at the beginning of the German Weimar Republic in 1919 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ito 1954</a>).<sup><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup> After WWII there was a trend toward the introduction of VAT and toward an increasing degree of reliance to it (<a href=\"#bib46\">Harberger 2002</a>: 3). The EU introduced the VAT already in the 1960s.<sup><a href=\"#fn4\">4</a></sup> The VAT substituted the so far used turnover taxes that represented gross VAT (or production type VAT). In contrast to the modern net VAT (or consumption type VAT), the VAT burden<sup><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup> on the typically taxed inputs accumulates over the production chain in the gross VAT case, because the VAT burden on intermediary goods is not deductible. This problem of accumulating VAT burdens over the production chain hence increases prizes (\u201ccascade effect\u201d) and thus generates an incentive to concentrate, in order to be more competitive. Similar reforms toward net VAT arose in Latin America in the 1970s and in other developed economies such as Australia, Canada, Japan, and Switzerland in the 1980s. Many transitional and developing countries in Asia and Africa followed afterward (<a href=\"#bib56\">James 2011</a>). An important recent instance is China, that launched a VAT reform in 2009, where in mainland China the gross VAT was substituted by a net VAT (<a href=\"#bib64\">Lu &amp; Chen 2008</a>). For <a href=\"#bib19\">Cnossen (1998)</a> the widespread introduction of the modern VAT was the most important tax reform aspect in the second half of the last century.",

Economists hence suggest unified rates by abolishing reduced rates, tax free expenditures, and exemptions (<i>e.g.</i>, <a href=\"#bib10\">Boeters <i>et al.</i> 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">German Council of Economic Experts 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Peffekoven 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bettendorf and Cnossen 2014</a>). Moreover, a harmonization of VAT rates, especially the EU rules for reduced VAT rates, has been discussed since long ago (<i>cf.</i> <a href=\"#bib20\">Copenhagen Economics 2007</a>). Since the times of high unemployment rates in the EU, also ways of reducing labor cost has been intensively discussed, mainly with a focus of reducing the employers\u2019 contributions to the social insurance system by a switch to a system of financing it to a higher extent by indirect taxes, especially VAT. Political decisions on such comprehensive VAT reforms, however, require robust, trustworthy estimates of the economic, distributional and fiscal effects of all potential reform options. The main problem with such an evaluation is, however, that all potential reform scenarios cannot be observed, that is, represent counterfactual situations. If similar reforms have been undertaken by other regions, regression and evaluation studies of these reforms will help to evaluate particular reform scenarios, but always only the one realized there\u2014and still the effects in the own region may differ. Therefore, for a well-informed political decision governments ought to collect additional detailed region-specific information on all discussed reform scenarios. The tool for such evaluations are estimates via models that simulate the non-observable counterfactual scenarios.",

Correspondingly, the official VAT estimates of the German Federal Ministry of Finance (and probably of many other countries) root in an internal, non-public macro-simulation model, mainly at basis of the national account data on household expenditures. A seminal paper in this context is <a href=\"#bib12\">Boss (1997)</a>. These simulations are used for the tax estimations of the budget planning and the budget estimations in the context of reform plans within the ministry. Other macro models use computable general equilibrium models to simulate VAT reforms and its effects on GDP, employment, or welfare (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bosch &amp; van den Noord 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Jackman <i>et al.</i> 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">European Commission 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Bye <i>et al.</i> 2012</a>). Most of these macrosimulation models are behavioral models, that is, they incorporate potential behavioral responses of the economic agents. In the political debate on VAT, however, it is the distributional (and other socioeconomic) effects that are in the center of the debate. Based on macro data alone, the incidence effects remain open. Input-output models\u2014developed, <i>e.g.</i>, by <a href=\"#bib83\">Scutella (1999)</a> and reviewed by <a href=\"#bib88\">Warren (2008)</a>\u2014allow to disaggregate macro data to the many industry sectors and the few final consumption types that are documented by the national input-output tables. <a href=\"#bib73\">Nie and Yue (2012)</a>, <i>e.g.</i>, also distinguish rural and urban areas, as well as poor and rich individuals in China, in order to draw inequality conclusions with regard to indirect taxation. Generally, only micro data, that is, representative data on at least all relevant groups of society and its specific expenditures, allow deducing the distributional and socioeconomic effects, however. Adequate micro data allow investigating in detail the expenditures for a bundle of different specific goods of single households with manifold different mixes of characteristics (see below). Therefore, micro data\u2014if available\u2014 allow in depth analyses beyond input-output approaches.",

Most work on microsimulation has been done in the area of direct taxes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Decoster <i>et al.</i> 2011</a>).<sup><a href=\"#fn6\">6</a></sup> MSMs on indirect taxes are rare. Besides our model, the German VAT is also simulated in <a href=\"#bib4\">Bach (2005)</a> and <a href=\"#bib53\">Ismer <i>et al.</i> (2010)</a>, who both are geared to the basic model in <a href=\"#bib38\">Fritzsche <i>et al.</i> (2003)</a>. These MSMs are static and do not incorporate behavioral responses. <a href=\"#bib10\">Boeters <i>et al.</i> (2010)</a> simulate the German VAT in an applied general equilibrium (AGE) model and deduce a welfare as well as a distribution analysis for some revenue-neutral reform options. The study uses German micro data, but aggregates the data to only three groups (terciles of income) that are incorporated in their AGE model. That is, it improves the analysis of behavioral responses but is weaker with respect to in depth incidence analysis. A less recent welfare analysis of VAT is <a href=\"#bib60\">Kaiser and Spahn (1989)</a>, who also use micro data where 13 commodity expenditures were distinguished. The study is normative, however, and tries to deduce empirically the optimal structure of VAT rates in West Germany. There are also two papers addressing redistributive effects of indirect taxes (including VAT) applying EUROMOD, where different EU member states are studied (<a href=\"#bib74\">O\u2019Donoghue <i>et al.</i> 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Decoster <i>et al.</i> 2011</a>). Both extend EUROMOD by an indirect-taxes module and propose to overcome the lack of expenditure data, required to simulate indirect taxation, by imputation techniques. What is missing, however, is a rigorous documentation of the VAT issues to be accounted for by MSMs. Most MSMs have focused on personal income taxes, social security contributions and benefits, instead of addressing indirect taxes, because they attribute a \u201crelative simplicity\u201d to most VAT and excise systems (<a href=\"#bib23\">Decoster <i>et al.</i> 2011</a>). As will become clear, simulating the EU VAT system is challenging, too\u2014especially due to complex elements that cause \u201chidden\u201d VAT payments.

In particular, we emphasize that there are more than the obvious open VAT payments, we all are aware of. Due to several exemptions stated in the VAT laws there are further hidden VAT burdens (<a href=\"#bib44\">Gottfried &amp; Wiegard 1991</a>) that are borne by individuals via tax shifting by firms\u2014and very often neglected in VAT analyses. The background is that the EU VAT intends to levy all VAT burden at the consumer\u2019s side but, in practice, actually leaves significant burdens at the firm\u2019s side, so that these burdens are likely shifted to the consumer via nonobvious indirect channels. Our VAT simulation model covers all differentiated VAT rates and those exemption effects. Though we do not use a general equilibrium model, we allow for behavioral responses due to specific price elasticities of demand, so that our model is a semi-behavioral model. In a second step, a specific application to the German VAT is performed and explained in detail, to illustrate the functioning of the model in practice. The German case is an instance where the model does not suffer from a lack of sufficient micro data on expenditures. This application also serves as a documentation of the VAT simulation model that we developed at RWI Essen for Germany, which, hereafter, we will label RWI-VAT-SIM. We extend the static RWI-VAT-SIM to a semi-behavioral model, however, and incorporate some further improvements. Overall, this article basically performs three contributions: (i) a general survey on the background of VAT and the issues to be accounted for; (ii) providing a comprehensive general MSM for the EU type of VAT; and (iii) a detailed application of it to Germany. The article ought to provide the theoretical basis for the development of VAT MSMs for the EU member states (and beyond).

The special element of the net VAT is the invoice or credit method of accounting, that, <i>de facto</i>, guarantees that consumption is the tax base (<a href=\"#bib57\">Jenkins &amp; Lamech 1991</a>). In this system the purchase tax is a tax that only burdens the net value added of a good or service, measured over all steps of the production chain. That is, it is a net value-added tax at each state of production with the right of input-tax deduction, which ought to prevent the well-known cascade effects of sales taxes of the gross VAT type. In order to achieve that only the net value added is taxed, the invoice method put on order that sellers of products have a claim to subtract all VAT payments having paid on inputs and investment goods from the amount of VAT revenue it earned at selling its final goods. That is, the effective revenue to be transferred to the fiscal administration is statutory VAT on turnover minus VAT paid on inputs and investments of the firm. Therefore, no pre-burden is accumulated over the production chain and the final consumer only pays the official VAT rate applied to net value added. The VAT typically is an <i>ad valorem</i> tax: the seller of a good adds the VAT rate, labeled <i><b>\u03c4</b></i>, to the producer or net prize, labeled <i>p</i>. It is the consumer that should bear the tax burden via the consumer or gross prize <i>p</i>\u00b7 (1 + \u03c4) . So the VAT is a form of consumption tax where the seller is considered to only channel the tax revenue to the state. In practice, as is well known in public economics, this tax shifting is limited in the short-term due to market conditions such as the degree of competition and the size of the price elasticity of good demand relative to supply (<a href=\"#bib71\">Musgrave &amp; Musgrave 1984</a>: 453\u2013457).",

The destination principle requires that internationally traded goods are taxed in the country where they are consumed.<sup><a href=\"#fn7\">7</a></sup> Further advantages are discussed, for instance, in <a href=\"#bib71\">Musgrave and Musgrave (1984)</a> or <a href=\"#bib57\">Jenkins and Lamech (1991)</a>.

There is a general standard rate on all purchases stated, but the respective laws explicitly state long lists of goods and services that are taxed at, sometimes up to three, reduced rates. The typical candidate for the reduced rate in most EU member states are the expenditures for food, but there are many other expenditures like those for books, newspapers, journals, cultural events, or local public transport that are enjoying reduced VAT rates in many member states. Moreover, there are a number of consumption transactions that are, <i>de facto,</i> taxed at a rate of zero. The major tax exemptions (tax rate of zero) involve all sales that represent exports, in order to establish the destination principle of international goods taxation and guaranteeing the consistence with the EU tax treaties. But there are further instances in many countries, <i>e.g.,</i> expenditures for rents (for dwellings, resp. housing), or sales in the context of sea shipping and aviation. And the goods with a rate of zero have to be distinguished further, depending on the specific details referring the invoice method, as we explain below.",

The credit method would be simple if all entrepreneurs and companies would have a claim on the credit on the VAT burden at their inputs in the production chain. While some final sales are not taxed and, at the same time, the entrepreneur still has a claim on tax credits for input burdens (zero-rating), others are not taxed, too, but the entrepreneur has no tax credit claim for VAT burdens on his inputs or investment goods (VAT exemption), with the consequence that there remains the VAT burden on all inputs. So there are distinct differences between these two cases, though, at first sight, both sales are burdened at a VAT rate of zero (<a href=\"#bib57\">Jenkins &amp; Lamech 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Gottfried &amp; Wiegard 1991</a>). In the case of zero-rating, the final product is sold without (national) VAT burden. In the case of exemption, in stark contrast, there is at most a partial relief. There is even an extra VAT burden when the sum of input VAT payments exceed the hypothetical tax liability of the final consumption, given by <i>\u03c4\u00b7p:</i> the cascade effect at the production chain remains because there is no claim on subtracting former VAT payments paid for inputs. Note that only zero-rating fully realizes the destination principle, since items with inputs that involve exemptions may still bear national VAT burdens (<a href=\"#bib44\">Gottfried &amp; Wiegard 1991</a>). That is, if national exports bear higher implicit VAT burdens than their foreign counterparts, this represents a disadvantage of international competitiveness. And higher relative implicit VAT burdens due to exemptions also function as import subsidy. Traditionally, the meaning of zero-rating is high in Ireland and the UK, while in France, Germany, and many other EU member states the exemption is used more heavily (<a href=\"#bib44\">Gottfried &amp; Wiegard 1991</a>). Typically VAT systems in the EU (and beyond) make use of both tools simultaneously, however. The quantitative meaning of such distortions is high. <a href=\"#bib44\">Gottfried and Wiegard (1991)</a> estimate that, for instance, in Germany only 63% of the effective VAT burden is explicitly borne by consumption, and that the residual VAT is intransparently borne by firms via input and investment goods. Firms that have no claim to credit former VAT burdens on inputs and investments, however, will, at least in the long run, shift this VAT burden via consumer prices to the consumers. Therefore, about 40% of the VAT burden would be borne by individuals via intransparent \u201chidden\u201d channels. To cover all VAT payments, and thus the effective VAT burden of the consumers in an incidence analysis, these implicit hidden VAT burdens due to exemptions have to be taken into account. And the same holds for any estimates for the VAT revenue of the state or budgetary effects of VAT reform options. Neglecting the hidden VAT burdens we will sharply underestimate the VAT burden borne by households and, given an asymmetric distribution of the hidden VAT across different social groups, this will distort the results of any incidence analysis.",

Given up to six different parallel VAT rates we at least require data that allow to distinguish these up to six different expenditures involved as close as possible. If a reform does change the classification of the single expenditure groups we will need data that allow to simulate this change, that is, in-depth expenditure information is required: if, <i>e.g.,</i> food is not anymore taxed at the super-reduced but at the normal reduced rate we need exact expenditure data on food. This may still be performed by well macro data. If we want to analyze the heterogeneous VAT burden levied on the many relevant social groups, and its changes due to specific reform steps (redistribution), however, the data requirement is much higher, because it demands in-depth information on expenditures and on all individual characteristics to encompass all these groups. This is only possible with highly disaggregated micro data. To draw trustworthy results, we also need micro data that cover this information in a representative sample of individuals or households. The VAT payment is typically not reported in micro data, but only the consumption expenditures. Hence, VAT payments have to be simulated by combining VAT system information with information in the micro data. Especially to simulate the hidden VAT burden, we additionally require national account and input-output statistics that have to be combined with specific in-depth micro data information.

Given imperfect competition in the retail sector, however, they find for some goods, <i>e.g.</i> some food items, that sales taxes are over-shifted. In these cases, our assumption of a complete shifting may even underestimate the VAT burden. Referring the time of reaction, they find that prices respond quite rapidly to tax changes\u2014within about one quarter. <a href=\"#bib27\">Deutsche Bundesbank (2008)</a> applies time-series price data for the largest European economy, Germany, and analyzes specifically the price effects of VAT. Observing the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) and its main subgroups they find that the German VAT increase<sup><a href=\"#fn16\">16</a></sup> in 2007 was completely shifted to the consumers within about a year, but that this average effect roots in over-shifting for some goods and under-shifting of others, which is explained by menu cost. The overall conclusion, therefore, is that a full shifting is arguable and supported at the aggregate level, at least for the U.S. and Germany. The researcher must be aware of the potential variety in the degree of tax shifting for specific goods, however.",

When firms sell goods that are exempted from VAT, the production of this good required the input of commodities that were burdened by VAT, nonetheless. In the case where the tax law does not allow any claim on a credit for this VAT burden borne at former stages of the production chain (VAT exemption instead of zero-rating), the firm would, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, face a VAT burden, although the intention of VAT is that the final burden is borne by the consumer. Hence, firms will most likely shift this VAT burden via the prices to this addressee. That is, the \u201cspurious\u201d VAT exemptions of firms may cause additional hidden VAT burdens. Again, it is true that depending on market conditions this shifting is heterogeneous across commodity items and does not occur <i>ad hoc</i>. It is also conceivable that there exist other shifting channels, for instance, wages.<sup><a href=\"#fn17\">17</a></sup> We assume, however, that in the long term all VAT burdens faced by firms are shifted to the consumers via increased prices, as in the open VAT case.",

Typical instances are housing construction, medical services and the health system, the social security system (or national insurance), and private insurances. Many expenditures within these sectors involve VAT burdens, but final products are exempted from VAT, so that these are likely shifted to the private households. As an example, investments for residential buildings are burdened by the standard VAT rate but rents are free from any VAT in Germany. Hence, the VAT most likely is shifted by the investors to the tenants via the rent, although no VAT burden is transparent. Hence, it is not the landlord but the tenant who eventually bears the VAT burden. In the health system, all VAT burdens hospitals, doctors and other actors in the system pay are shifted first to the health insurances, that shift them further to the private households via higher contributions to the social health insurance or higher premiums for private health insurances. The same happens with all other VAT burdens in the context of the social security institutions and other private insurances. Therefore, although the goods seem to not involve any VAT burden because of VAT exemptions, the private households, in fact, bear them via higher expenditures. Accounting for these hidden burdens significantly changes the specific true VAT burden of different socio-economic groups and hence the distributional effects of a VAT system or VAT reform.

In a first step, we turn back to the goods identified as being exempted from VAT or being not liable for VAT. Within these goods we now have to check whether there are inputs or investments along the production chain that are burdened by VAT but the producers have no claim on a credit for these, so that they may shift it toward consumers in the long run. The researcher must identify VAT burdens not covered by the so far identified open VAT and develop theories how these VAT burdens may be shifted to consumers, as in the example of rents in Germany: rents are not directly burdened by VAT (not liable for VAT) but landlords have no right to assert a claim on the paid VAT for their input and investment expenditures. The counterpart of the respective burdened firm expenditures that is transporting the hidden VAT to the private individuals is the respective final consumption of the good which required the burdened item as input. Final consumption in our example is rent payment.

Consequently, the budget constraint demands for modifications of the other demand items. We assume a modification of savings alone, for simplicity. In so doing, we only account for the direct effects of reforms. After a tax rate reduction, for instance, there remains a positive fraction of the budget that may increase consumption of other commodities than savings and, thus, VAT revenue.

Hence, the lag to be corrected for is a quarter, that is, we subtract from the published number the revenue of the first quarter and add the revenue in the first quarter of the following year.

Micro data typically base on surveys where different groups display different willingness to participate.

At this basis, representative weights for each single micro unit have to be generated, if not already provided. The reader is referred to the corresponding literature (<i>e.g.</i>, <a href=\"#bib16\">Chesher &amp; Nesheim 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Fazio <i>et al.</i> 2006</a>).

Micro data are often not provided for each consecutive year, but only each three or five years, or even only for one year. If results should be deduced for a specific year the used micro data have to be updated to this year. For years in the past, the relevant macro data are typically at hand up to the last year, unless they have to be taken from input-output tables. The input-output data is only available with many years of delay, so that we can only extrapolate them. For the running year forward projections and estimates have to be used as detailed as possible. If the micro data are generated several years in the past, it is also important to update structural changes in the years that followed, that is, changed fractions of specific social groups, for instance, receivers of unemployment and social benefits. Given distributional analyses typically use total micro VAT burden of a household relative to an income indicator, it is especially imperative to update changes in the income distribution. Again, updating is not a special issue for a VAT MSM and has been discussed in many articles in the literature, for instance, in <a href=\"#bib28\">Deville and S\u00e4rndal (1992)</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">Gupta and Kapur (2000)</a>, <a href=\"#bib52\">Immervoll <i>et al.</i> (2005)</a>, or <a href=\"#bib5\">Ball and Creedy (2013)</a>.

A major part of the rent payments represents the investment return, and thus does not involve VAT payments for the households. The part of the rent that covers compensation for the standard cost, however, incorporate VAT payments. In an earlier version of the model, we estimated the fraction of VAT-burdened rents by a model of financial mathematics (<a href=\"#bib38\">Fritzsche <i>et al.</i> 2003</a>: 184\u2013186). Since <a href=\"#bib80\">RWI and FiFo (2007)</a> we estimate the fraction at basis of exact calculations of the Statistical Office, provided by the micro data: While we do not know the separation between base rent and extra charges in rent payments in the data, the German office calculates for owners imputed base rents separated from imputed condominium fees or common charges. This allows to calculate in the micro data that, on average, the common charges amount to 17.5% of the complete rent payments. Based on model calculations, <i>e.g.,</i> of the German tenant association (<a href=\"#bib30\">DMB 2006</a>), about one-fifth of the extra charges is exempted from VAT, and the residual charges are taxed by standard rate <i><b>X</b><sup>s</sup>.</i> Therefore, we apply a weight of about 0.86 for the actual rent payments in the category exempted goods.",

These VAT burdens in producing medical services are assumed to be finally shifted to the health insured via their contributions and premia to the health system. In Germany, we have to distinguish for investments in the fields \u2018new buildings\u2019, that are burdened at the standard rate of 0.19, and \u2018new and further equipment\u2019, where the reduced rate of 0.07 is levied on. Both macroeconomic aggregates are also documented in <a href=\"#bib24\">Destatis (2012a)</a>. Following the same procedure we obtain a hidden VAT burden on these items of about \u20ac 1.1 billion and \u20ac 0.6 billion, respectively. Additionally, it must be accounted for the VAT burden on used input goods in the health system. These VAT burdened input payments can be deduced from the input-output tables. Since the end of 2012 the 2008 numbers are published (<a href=\"#bib25\">Destatis 2012b</a>). It is important to note, however, that only those input groups are included that are burdened by VAT, which complicates the task. Once again the list documented in the VAT law is used. Moreover, elements that involve especially wage payments have to be excluded, because they are not burdened with VAT, and the tables including imports have to be used. Doing so, we obtain an additional hidden VAT burden of about \u20ac 5.3 billion. In sum, calculated with the precise non-rounded numbers, the health system is assumed to shift, in the long run, VAT burdens of about \u20ac 7.1 billion to the private households. Calculating the weights <i>f<sub>lj</sub></i> in this field is not straight forward. The respective contributions or premia for the health insurance are recorded in the IES for each member of the household. People who are compulsory insured in the statutory health insurance pay the hidden VAT burden via higher contributions. Given in Germany the insured itself pays half of the contribution and the employer the other half, the IES is only recording half of the relevant contribution, so that we double the compulsory contribution recorded in variable ef202. For voluntarily insured in the statutory health insurance (variable ef208), the person pays the complete contribution, so that no doubling is done. Finally, the privately insured pay higher premia as well, so that we account for variable ef211. On average, 40% of the premium is used to build up reserves for the old age, however. Therefore, we use only the residual 60% of the premium of privately insured persons in calculating weight <i>f<sub>lj</sub></i>.",

We assume that only 10% of these expenditures involve the reduced rate <i>\u03c4<sup>r</sup></i> = 0.07 and the remaining expenditures the standard rate <i>\u03c4<sup>s</sup></i> = 0.19, which results in an implicit average VAT rate of 15.1%.

Then, the VAT revenue paid by non-residential people amounts to about \u20ac 3.8 billion. The VAT payments of the territorial authorities, in turn, root in VAT payments on gross investments of these authorities and on the inputs used by these authorities. The former is documented in <a href=\"#bib24\">Destatis (2012a)</a> (\u20ac 38.16 billion), while the latter can be found in <a href=\"#bib25\">Destatis (2012b)</a> (\u20ac 33.64 billion).

Within the hidden VAT burden the major item are the housing investments that cause more than 60% of the hidden VAT. Following our simulation, 53% of the expenditures involve the standard of 19% VAT, only 17% the often discussed reduced rate, and 30% a rate of zero. If we modify this calculation to the actually relevant pre-VAT situation and use as proxy for net consumption, the expenditures divided by 1 + <i>\u03c4<sub>i</sub></i>, the fractions of zero rate and reduced rate slightly increase while the fraction of the standard rate decreases to 49%. Compared to the benchmark scenario where the German VAT law would state that all liable expenditures are unified to be taxed at standard rate <i>\u03c4<sup>s</sup></i> = 0.19, the 2008 system provided VAT reliefs amounting to \u20ac 86 billion via open lower-than-standard VAT rates, which represents nearly 50% of the total 2008 VAT revenue. This result, however, is based on the critical assumption that the households consume with a unified rate all goods at the same amount as in the non-unified scenario, in real terms.

Moreover, this burden indicators can be measured group-specific as mean or median ratio, that is, the mean of the respective household ratios or the median of the respective household ratios, where the median has the advantage that it is not affected by extreme realizations for single households or data errors (outliers) and thus represents the \u201ctypical\u201d burden. Alternatively, the average burden can be measured by the ratio of the sum of the VAT payments and the sum of the net household incomes (or consumption) of all group members, which, however, will produce different results compared to the former mean ratio, as the first approach represents the mean over all ratios in the group, while the latter represents the average VAT payment per income or consumption unit of the group.

The first two blocks on income deciles and brackets reveal the often discussed regressive character of the VAT, namely that the VAT burden decreases when income rises. In <a href=\"#table6\">Table 6</a> we provide the results for the mean burden, including the burden on gross and net consumption. It reveals that the mean burden on HNI is regressive but that the mean burden on consumption is rather progressive, that is, that it rises when income rises. Not surprising, the annual VAT payment is also progressive\u2014though the degree of progressivity is markedly lower than the degree of regressivity on HNI. <a href=\"#table7\">Table 7</a> reveals that, indeed, households with low income simply consume more of their net income and thus face a higher VAT burden, compared to households with higher income. Moreover, low-income households consume more heavily the goods that face a reduced or zero rate of VAT, which mitigates the effect of being forced to consume more, as intended by politicians. The differences are less striking as probably expected, however.",

Accumulating the group-specific payments and comparing it to total revenue, we can deduce the sourcing fractions, respectively. <a href=\"#table8\">Table 8</a> informs about these fractions for major groups in society. The income-weakest 50% of the population (sum of the first five deciles), for instance, bear only about a third of the VAT revenue (accumulated financing fraction of 33%), just as the income-strongest 20% of the population (sum of tenth and ninth decile with inverse accumulated fraction of 32.8%). Having a look on the results for the income brackets, reveals that the persons with a net equivalence income below \u20ac 40,000, however, bear nearly 80% of the VAT revenue, because most households are located in this income bracket (nearly 88%).",

In cooperation with Wolfgang Wiegard we also analyzed by how far potential reform options do deviate from a distribution-neutral reform and how much money would have to be redistributed per household in respective groups to reestablish distribution neutrality (<i>cf.</i> <a href=\"#bib43\">German Council of Economic Experts 2010</a>).

Up to 2009, Germany was one of the rare exceptions in the EU (together with Denmark and the U.K.) that did tax hotel accommodation at the standard rate, which was considered to be a disadvantage of international competitiveness (<a href=\"#bib58\">Jensen &amp; Wanhill 2002</a>). Therefore, the German government reduced the VAT rate on accommodation services of hotels (and the like) in 2010, too. <a href=\"#bib34\">European Commission (2014)</a> reveals that today 25 out of the 28 member states apply reduced rates on these services. The remaining three missing nations are Denmark, Lithuania, and the U.K. For Germany this meant that hotel accommodation switched from the set of standard rate <i>\u03c4<sup>s</sup></i> = 0.19 (<i><b>S</b></i>) to the goods taxed at reduced rate <i>\u03c4<sup>r</sup></i> = 0.07 (<i><b>R</b></i>). The change in VAT rate thus is 12%-points, d<i>\u03c4<sub>i</sub></i> = \u22120.12, which represents a reduction by 63.2%. In a static model, the individual VAT payments are simulated as 0.07\u00b7<i>E<sub>i</sub></i>/1.19, and we assume no real response in consumption. That is, the number of guest-nights remain unchanged. In the semi-behavioral version, we apply a price elasticity of consumption to catch the real response of the individuals, that is, an increase in the number of guest-nights due to lower price.",

In contrast, <a href=\"#bib58\">Jensen and Wanhill (2002)</a> estimate that a reduction of the accommodation VAT rate by 50% would increase hotel and holiday centre overnights by 6% in Denmark, which would represent an elasticity of \u22120.12 and be close to the estimates of <a href=\"#bib18\">Clements and Qiang (2003)</a> for \u2018housing\u2019.",

Such a comprehensive presentation, however, is not the purpose of this article. Interested readers are referred to the comprehensive research reports on many different issues, only in German language, unfortunately (see footnote 22). In these studies we simulated the incidence and budget effects of several reform options, for instance, when all reduced rates would be canceled and unified to the standard rate, or which lower VAT rate would be budget neutral in such a unified VAT-rate scenario (German Council of Economic Experts 2010: paragr. 386\u2013390).",

Political decisions on the issue, however, must root in a good understanding of how VAT functions and affects especially the budget, the different social groups, and thus the inequality in society. All reform options represent counterfactual situations, that is, situations we cannot observe\u2014and hence must be simulated. While budget and macro effect may be simulated well at basis of macro data, distributional and group-specific effects can only be simulated with micro data.",

It became clear that, in contrast to a widespread opinion, VAT simulation also involves complex processes that must be incorporated in a MSM. A major issue in this context is how to simulate individual VAT burdens that arise from \u201cspurious\u201d VAT exemptions that cause, despite VAT exemption, VAT burdens at the side of firms, and thus most likely are shifted to consumers as a \u201chidden\u201d VAT burden, at least in the long run. Another issue is the correction for under-reporting of single consumption items, for the estimation error with respect to the budget, and, in this context, for the phase difference, that is, that the observed expenditures in the data generate revenue only with a certain delay. We provide a simulation procedure to cope with all these issues in a MSM. We argue that simulation of distributional and budget effects ought to be separated: correction of under-reporting is only applied for estimating budget effects, as it would bias the distributional analysis, given we have no information on group-specific under-reporting levels. We suggest estimating mean and median burdens via regression techniques, instead of the use of simple statistical formulas. In contrast to the simple statistical calculation, regression techniques provide standard errors, which allow to report confidence intervals and thus to perform t-tests to check whether differences between different groups of society are actually statistically significant. The general model is considered as a blueprint for a VAT-MSM in any country with a VAT of the EU type. As an illustration of the functioning and the in-detail problems that arise in practice\u2014and how to solve them\u2014we applied the model to the specific case of Germany. Elaborating through this specific case, the strict data requirements for a VAT-MSM became clear, and must be considered at any attempt to replicate the model for another country. Finally, we have to keep in mind that our MSM involves some critical assumptions. All simulation results thus have to be discussed with this qualification. For instance, we assume that all VAT burdens faced by firms are shifted to the consumers in the long run. The research on VAT shifting, however, is not yet clear on that issue, although the current literature suggests that the full-shifting hypothesis is correct at the aggregate level.",

The IES covers more than 200 items of expenditures. The micro unit in the IES is basically the household, that is, the group of persons that live in one housing unit. The manifold detailed expenditure information allow a comprehensive in-depth analysis of consumption taxes by different socio-economic and socio-demographic groups. The IES is cross-section data and conducted at five-year intervals. Participation of survey is on a voluntary basis. In every survey year, about 60,000 households are contacted, which represents the \u201clargest survey of its kind throughout the European Union.\u201d<sup><a href=\"#fn34\">34</a></sup> The IES is based on quota sampling, that is, households are selected and included following a specified quota plan, in order to reach representativity. In a first step, the households are divided by L\u00e4nder (the 16 German states), and then by household type, social status of the main income earner, and finally by net household income. Participating households record their expenditures in a household book for three month. \u201cTo ensure an even distribution across the year, the overall sample\u201d is constructed on basis of four equal sized household groups, each covering one of the four quarters of the year. The 2008 wave of the IES is available since autumn 2010. The statistical office undertakes several plausibility checks during the processing stage. Therefore, given the large number of observations the data \u201care highly accurate and reliable.\u201d Due to the quota plan and comparison with the German micro census data, the data are \u201crepresentative for almost all households ... However, the [IES] does not provide data on persons living in communal establishments and institutions because they are not included in the household definition applied in the survey. The [IES] neither provides data on households with a monthly net income of \u20ac 18,000 or more as the number of these households participating in the survey is usually not sufficient to provide reliable information on their standards of living.\u201d This upper income threshold causes that there is a selection bias toward the poorer income brackets, and an under-representation of the very-high-income households.<sup><a href=\"#fn35\">35</a></sup> The next IES survey took place in the year 2013, but will be available not before autumn of the year 2015. The IES provides for each household a weight to produce representative results, that we use in all simulations. The weights are calculated based on a detailed generalized regression estimation (<i>cf.</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, <a href=\"#bib1\">Afentakis and Bihler 2005</a>). The assumption of an i.i.d. random sample, however, is still not fully fulfilled because the survey follows an approach of quota sampling.<sup><a href=\"#fn36\">36</a></sup>",
