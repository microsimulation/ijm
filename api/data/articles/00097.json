This problem is particularly important when simulating events that have a strong geographic component, such as internal migration, and destination choice of external migrants. This paper is part of a larger research program that aims at developing a dynamic time-based microsimulation projection model of the population of the Montreal metropolitan area and its 79 municipalities, by age, sex, and language. It presents an innovative treatment of migration by taking into consideration previous changes in local conditions when determining mobility and destination choices. Municipalities are first divided into two categories, suburban and the central city, to compute location-specific probabilities of moving by age, language and place of birth. Then, the destination choice of movers is based on a utility function that accounts for five important determinants of residential choice: (1) the distance from the central city, (2) the current size of the population of each municipality, (3) the municipality development potential, (4) the linguistic composition of its population, and (5) the geographical location. A similar function is estimated to allocate a place of residence to external migrants. Parameters are estimated using conditional logistic regressions and are implemented into the microsimulation model. The model is validated over the 2006\u20132011 period and results of the reference scenario presented for 2031.",

Using cohort-component or multi-state approaches these models are not adequate for planning of local services and needs, such as places in childcare or services for the elderly because they are unable to account for all the spatial interactions (<a href=\"#bib22\">Harding, Vidyattama <i>et al</i>., 2011</a>). Yet, local and municipal governments also need tools for planning, in particular to ensure public services under their responsibility (aqueducts, parks, waste collection, etc.) and urban planning (<a href=\"#bib26\">Isserman 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Foss 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Swanson &amp; Pol 2008</a>). Small area population projections have unquestionable value: they can be used for planning purposes, but also in a prospective approach such as measuring the impact of a change in public policy, such as zoning, on the spatial distribution of the population (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ballas, Clarke <i>et al</i>., 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wilson 2011</a>).",

While in many North American cities residential segregation is related to ethnic or racial groups, Montreal differs from other North American cities by the presence of two main linguistic groups: the francophone majority, descendants of the first colonists who came from France and founders of the city, and a wealthier English-speaking minority which gradually developed after the British conquest of New France (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brunet 1955</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Vaillancourt 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">S\u00e9guin 1987</a>). Montreal is also the port of entry of a large majority of immigrants landing in the province of Qu\u00e9bec and recent high levels of increasingly diverse immigration has favored the emergence of another, more heterogeneous, linguistic group: the allophones, a term which in Canada defines those who speak another language than French or English at home. While racial or ethnical spatial segregation doesn\u2019t appear to be important in the Montreal area, a spatial pattern is clearly apparent in the residential choice of linguistic groups (<a href=\"#bib35\">Marois &amp; B\u00e9langer 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">Marois and B\u00e9langer 2014, Forthcoming</a>).",

At this level, individual decisions regarding choice of a place of residence depends on the changes over time in each potential location relative to all other alternatives. Thus, another difficulty faced when projecting small area populations is related to the implementation of contextual factors which may highly influence individual decision-making and local population growth. A rigorous small area population projections model must also take into account those contextual variables that can be determining factors in the migrants\u2019 decision-making, such as the distance from a central point, the socio-demographic composition or physical characteristics of the territory (<a href=\"#bib39\">Murdock, Hamm <i>et al</i>. 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chi, Zhou <i>et al</i>. 2011</a>). Similarly, urban planning can sometimes affect the projection since it has a major role in housing supply (<a href=\"#bib39\">Murdock, Hamm <i>et al</i>. 1991</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">Dittgen 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">Bergouignan 2010</a>). Geographical and contextual variables should thus be implemented as parameters to avoid the self-fulfilling effect of projections (e.g., when the urban plan is modified to integrate previous projection results). However, most small area projection models ignore contextual and environmental factors. Accordingly, traditional demographic methods such as the Hamilton-Perry method, the top-down method or the iterative proportional fitting method are generally used (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hamilton &amp; Perry 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Birkin &amp; Clarke 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rees 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rees, Norman <i>et al</i>. 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Simpson &amp; Tranmer 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ballas, Clarke <i>et al</i>. 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Institut de la statistique du Qu\u00e9bec 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Menthonnex 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Swanson, Schlottmann <i>et al</i>. 2010</a>).",

This approach suggests that events that mark the life cycle, such as union formations and dissolutions, births of children, or the departures of children from parental house, are determinants of residential mobility, because the residential needs of the family are changing after the occurrences of these events. Since they are generally correlated with age, this variable is therefore a key determinant of residential mobility.",

Thus, we propose, as a first step in the modeling of internal migration, to stratify migrants according to the type of move rather than by municipality of origin.

The projection model must therefore use a micro approach and microsimulation is the preferred method. Microsimulation simulates processes and life events (e.g., mortality, fertility, residential mobility, etc.) of individuals following behavioral assumptions which parameters are derived from empirical data (<a href=\"#bib40\">Orcutt 1957</a>). The probability that each type of events occurs is calculated for each individual and the occurrence of a particular event is determined using a Monte Carlo process. Following the event, characteristics of the simulated individual may change (life status is changed to dead, number of births is incremented, place of residence changes, etc.). Statistical indicators, such as population size, age structure, socio-demographic composition, etc. can then be computed from the aggregation of individual data. <a href=\"#bib41\">Post and Van Imhoff (1998)</a> argue that microsimulation is particularly appropriate when \u201cthe problem requires a large state space\u201d (p. 107). The possibility of including a large number of individual attributes is another major advantage of microsimulation compared to a component-cohort method. This method is then appropriate for local projections because of the large number of municipalities and individual characteristics that are simultaneously projected.",

First, we estimated fertility rates by age, language spoken at home and type of municipality (central municipality or suburb) using the own children method applied to 2006 Census data. As expected, our results show that fertility is lower among women living in the central city than those living in the suburbs for francophones (1.33 vs 1.66) and anglophones (1.47 vs 1.75), but not for allophones (2.35 vs 1.87). One reason that can explain this last finding is that fertility tends to be higher among recent immigrants (<a href=\"#bib4\">B\u00e9langer &amp; Gilbert 2002</a>) who are more likely to be allophones. Since most immigrants first settle in the central municipality, it can inflate the estimate. As the duration of residence in Canada increases, immigrants\u2019 fertility converges towards the level of the native-born population and at the same time immigrants tend also to move to other areas of the metropolitan area. Using these rates as input, we performed a first simulation from 2006 to 2011 and we compared the projected number of births by municipality with the observed numbers. We then calibrated municipality\u2019s fertility rates so that the total number of simulated births for each municipality matches the recorded data while the relative differences between population groups were maintained<a href=\"#fn4\"><sup>5</sup></a>.",

Language shifts over the life course concern change in the language used at home by the individual over his own life and intergenerational language shifts concerns the non-transmission of the mother\u2019s mother tongue to the child at birth. Although Canada is rich of linguistic questions in censuses and surveys, there is no data set that can provide direct estimates of linguistic mobility. It is therefore necessary to use alternative methods to estimate language shifts over the lifetime. From analysis comparing cohort data from two censuses, we know that linguistic mobility is very low for both anglophones and francophones (<a href=\"#bib54\">Termote, Payeur <i>et al</i>. 2011</a>). In Quebec, language changes over the life course mainly concern allophones and even among them such transitions are rare past a given age. We adapted the census based cross-sectional method developed by <a href=\"#bib45\">Sabourin and B\u00e9langer (2011)</a> to estimate these transitions. First, those who answered speaking more than one language at home are randomly recoded into the three main categories: francophones, anglophones and allophones. Allophones are then stratified into four groups to take into account specific experiences that may affect their linguistic behavior: Canadian-born allophones, foreign-born allophones arrived at age 15 or younger, foreign-born allophones arrived between age 16 and 35 and foreign-born allophones arrived after the age of 35. Using the number of respondents declaring a non-official language as mother tongue as denominators and the number of those speaking English or French at home as numerators, we computed age-specific (in the case of Canadian-born) or duration-specific (in the case of immigrants) lifetime linguistic shift rates for each group of allophones.",

The variable about the RCM of residence shows that, even when controlling for population composition, some differences still remain between regions, meaning that a specific geographical component exists. As we did for modeling interprovincial and intraprovincial out-migrations, we also validated our model for internal migration by comparing the number of migrants observed by municipality in the 2001 and 2006 Census separately with the average number resulting from five probabilistic simulations for the same years using those parameters. Simulated numbers are in most cases in the same range as the observed and when the relative differences are large, it is for small municipalities with few migrants.",

The assumption is that the number of new entries in the model is about 96,500 per year which is about 40,000 international immigrants, 10,500 interprovincial in-migrants and 46,000 intraprovincial in-migrants moving on the MMC territory. Characteristics of these in-migrants are randomly imputed using a cold deck procedure based on a database of potential in-migrants created from the population living in the MMC at the 2006 Census, but elsewhere five years before. Assuming that external migrants arrive in the middle of the period, they are subject to half the risks of experiencing the other events during the year of their arrival.

In most cases, expected numbers are in the same range than observed numbers, meaning that our regression models are good predictors of the migrants\u2019 municipality of destination. Accordingly, we use these parameters as projection assumption. However, for some municipalities, the difference between the expected and observed in-migrants can be important, probably because some unobserved variables can influence municipalities\u2019 attractiveness. In these particular cases, we added an adjustment factor to calibrate the model, which highlights the difficulty of conceiving a model that can be applied in all contexts.",

The projected growth varies widely between municipalities from \u221238.1% to 82.9%.

These municipalities are new suburbs where the development potential is the largest according to urban plans. Our model predicts low growth for most municipalities on the island of Montreal (RCM66, see Map 1) and in oldest suburbs (RCM58, RCM72 and RCM73), where housing potential development are much lower because the land is already occupied. This shows the importance of this variable in small area population projections. Urban sprawl, however, could be limited by protecting agricultural land and increasing residential density in other parts of the MMC to absorb projected population growth, but this would necessitate major policy changes, which are clearly not in the assumptions of the authors of the urban plans.",

Actually, municipalities that currently or in the near future show fast population growth and are attractive to young families, will see faster population aging. In the future, parents of these families will age in place, while their children will more likely migrate to the central municipalities or elsewhere. As a result, the population aged 65 and over can quadruple in some of them between 2006 and 2031.

Furthermore, it takes into account the particular context of Montreal as the only metropolis in North America that is the home of a large francophone community and is receiving a large influx of immigrants from diverse origins and languages.

The second challenge concerns the investment in local infrastructure to face the aging of the population. Municipalities where the elderly population is expected to grow the fastest are those that nowadays attract young families. In the next decades, their infrastructure might need to be adapted for this changing population. Another result from our projections which can be of concern to policy-makers is the relative decline of the French community, which will be generalized in most of the MMC. As the language most commonly spoken in the neighbourhood is an important determinant of linguistic integration of allophones (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carpentier 2004</a>), the relative decline of French in most municipalities could therefore be an obstacle to the adoption of French by the fast-growing foreign-born population.",
