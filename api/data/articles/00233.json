The first paper, by Gemma Wright and a large number of co-authors, analyses the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on income poverty and inequality in South Africa, through the lenses of the static tax-benefit microsimulation model SAMOD, belonging to the EUROMOD family. Pre-pandemic earnings were calibrated using information from a follow-up survey.",

Using the Microsimulation model for Social Security in Argentina (MISSAR), developed in the LIAM2 dynamic framework, Calcagno also studies the effects of prolonging IFE for the whole of 2020.",

The paper follows a standard nowcasting procedure to adjust the input data. Interestingly, the authors find a lower effect on poverty than the official estimates.

The paper makes use of a relatively sophisticated nowcasting methodology previously developed by some of the authors, based on an \u201cincome generation model\u201d which predicts changes in income due to the pandemic. The paper also makes a methodological contribution by using a welfare measure for the assessment of the impact of the crisis where equivalised household disposable income is adjusted to account for changes in housing, child care and commuting costs and reflects impacts of changes in capital values, all of which are modelled.",
