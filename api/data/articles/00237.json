Given the lack of real-time survey data during the fast moving crisis, it applies a nowcasting methodology and real-time aggregate administrative data to calibrate an income survey and to simulate changes in the tax benefit system that attempted to mitigate the impacts of the crisis. Our analysis shows how crisis-induced income-support policy innovations combined with existing progressive elements of the tax-benefit system were effective in avoiding an increase in income inequality at all stages of waves 1-3 of the COVID-19 emergency in Ireland. There was, however, a decline in generosity over time as benefits became more targeted. On a methodological level, our paper makes a specific contribution in relation to the choice of welfare measure in assessing the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on inequality.",

At the core of our nowcasting approach lies a household income generation model (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sologon et al., 2021</a>). The model relies on data from the Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC) calibrated to account for the labour market and policy impacts of COVID-19 using administrative data and the Labour Force Survey (LFS). This allows generating counterfactual income distributions as a function of more timely external data than the underlying income survey.",

This representative survey contains information on socio-economic characteristics and incomes of households and living in them individuals, which is used for the construction of poverty and inequality indicators at the level of European Union. The Irish component is based on the information coming from two sources: a survey and register data. Overall, 80% of the respondents granted the permission to use their national social security numbers in order to access information on the benefit entitlement from administrative data (<a href=\"#bib14\">Callan et al., 2010</a>).",

There is relatively limited data in close to real time as to the sectoral impact of the crisis. The most suitable data to perform such calculations is the Administrative Data that is available on a monthly basis, typically 2-3 days after the end of the month, together with weekly updates in relation to aggregates that have been made. As is well documented, Live-Register data does not capture the level of unemployment equivalent to ILO measures. People can be working part-time whilst in receipt of benefits and conversely, someone can be out of work and seeking work, but not eligible for unemployment benefits. However, as an indicator in the short term, of a change in economic circumstances, the changes observed in the live register are an approximate indicator of changes in the numbers out of work (or non-employment rate). In this paper, the LFS is used to nowcast to December 2019, with the Administrative Data used to nowcast to May, June, August and November 2020 and January 2021. For much of the crisis, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment was paid to those who lost their jobs due to the COVID crisis, while the COVID Wage Subsidy supports those who remained at work. The latter was paid on the basis of bridging the pre-crisis income rather than covering specific hours. As a result labour supply as opposed to labour participation is not that relevant.",

The only difference relates to rounding that occurs due to the weighting in the survey. As individuals in the survey represent multiple people, the weighted total will never be exactly the same, but nevertheless as near as makes no qualitative difference. Of course an issue in doing this is that the survey may not necessarily have the same population base as a benefit instrument. This may be an issue for some social protection measures targeting vulnerable groups such as homeless and asylum seekers that may be under represented or not reported in the survey. However in the case of the Pandemic Payments that were mainly replacing the incomes of those that had been in work, we are confident that the base populations are close.

However given the volatility over the crisis, we transform the unit of analysis into current monthly income at the employment level of a particular week. This is in effect the assumption that were made within EUROMOD in earlier versions when current incomes were used prior to the use of SILC (<a href=\"#bib26\">O\u2019Donoghue, 1998</a>), where the parameters are assumed to be those that hold in the month of June. This is reasonable as current income is taxed on a PAYE basis and current status is relevant for benefit entitlement, with a correction in the end of year tax return. This approach can thus be considered as an approximation of current cash flow, rather than an annualised value of disposable implications. This is equivalent to the assumption made in incorporating deferred housing costs that are not eliminated, but rather reduced temporarily to improve cash flow during the crisis.",

Disposable incomes at the bottom of the distribution were largely maintained over the three waves and even higher in some cases where benefits were higher than pre-crisis market income. The gradual targeting of payments in later waves reduced the incidence of those at the bottom of the income distribution with disposable incomes that were higher than at the pre-crisis level. Disposable incomes at the top of the distribution fell by 10-20% at the start of the crisis, and recovered to about 10% in later waves.",

This progressivity was visible for all periods.

In particular, the country introduced a set of policy measures aiming to preclude employment losses (i.e. pandemic wage subsidy) or compensate for them (i.e. pandemic unemployment payment, COVID enhanced illness benefit). As a result, the redistributive role of social benefits almost doubled over the crisis, especially during the first wave of the outbreak when COVID-related benefits were the most generous. Given the close to universal entitlement and the initially flat rate and subsequently staggered payments, the increase in the redistributive effect resulted from a combination of the level of the payments and the volume of recipients, rather than from greater targeting. In contrast, the Irish tax system did not compensate much for the declines in market incomes \u2013 as our calculations show, the degree of redistribution reached via taxes remained almost unchanged. While looking at different stages of the crisis, one can conclude that the decrease in disposable income inequality was the largest during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic but became somewhat smaller afterwards following a reduction in the generosity of benefits as they became more targeted.",

The modelling approach illustrated in this paper, thus, informs about the trade-offs between different income measures (e.g. gross household income, disposable household income, adjusted disposable household income) and can be used to measure the degree of inequality attenuation reached via various policy tools (e.g. benefits, taxes, and policy driven changes in work related or housing costs).",
