The technique, referred to here as \u201cage-centred regression,\u201d is particularly useful when the available data set for estimating a model equation is limited and the marginal effect of one or more explanatory variables might be expected to vary systematically by age. The examples used here to describe how age-centring works are taken from the labour supply equations in the Congressional Budget Office Long-Term (CBOLT) dynamic microsimulation model. By switching from a traditional single-equation approach to age-centred regression, we show that marginal effects of independent variables can vary significantly across age groups. The comparison also reveals that improvements in mean predictions by age can be achieved with little if any loss in statistical precision of coefficient estimates.",

If individuals with certain characteristics are more likely to have certain outcomes, a good model will have transition equations that generate those correlations in simulations. Sample size limitations in the data sets used to estimate model equations can make achieving this goal a challenge, however, as they make it difficult to statistically sort out all of the covariance needed to replicate the desired heterogeneity. This paper discusses an estimation strategy, referred to as \u201cage-centred regression\u201d, that has proved useful for mitigating the types of problems in microsimulation that are typically associated with small sample sizes.",

First, the behavioural processes being estimated vary systematically with age: these processes include marital status transitions, fertility, mortality, and labour market outcomes. Second, these processes are such that the effect of any given explanatory variable could also vary by age: for example, higher educational attainment might lower the probability of marriage for very young singles, but increase the probability of marriage for middle-aged singles. Third, the data set available for estimating the model equation is limited, so that estimating separate equations for each age is infeasible and therefore some sort of grouping is required.",

For instance, in the marital transition equation, one might estimate separate marriage probability equations for young, middle-aged, and perhaps older individuals, so that the model would have three marriage equations. Age centring takes this grouping approach a step further. The idea is to estimate a separate equation for each unique (or \u201creference\u201d) age, but include every observation in the sample whose age is within a preset range (or \u201cbandwidth\u201d) around the reference age being estimated. Thus, if the sample being analyzed is 25-year-olds and the bandwidth is 4 years, the estimation phase would use all observations in the data set with ages 21 through 29. The equation for 26-year-olds would use every observation with ages 22 to 30, and so on. The end result is that the model will have separate equations for each reference age, but the sample used to estimate the equation for any given age overlaps with the data used to estimate nearby ages.",

One example is the extent to which lagged labour force participation is correlated with current labour force participation; the effect varies systematically over the life cycle and the age-centred equation is better able to capture that pattern than the more standard equation. A second example is the effect of marital status on expected part-time hours (conditional on working part-time).

In microsimulation modelling, researchers typically split the sample by age when estimating equations, although it is well understood that the effect of certain independent variables differs across age groups. Age-centred regression takes this logic a step further by estimating different equations for each unique \u201creference\u201d age. Estimating the equation for each age, however, limits the regression sample and reduces the statistical precision of the estimation. In order to overcome the small-sample-size problem, age-centred regression borrows a principle from kernel density analysis and includes all observations that are within a certain \u201cbandwidth\u201d of the reference age group in question. The technique allows statistical precision to be maintained at the same time that improved flexibility in estimated coefficients by age is achieved.",

As in kernel density estimation, declining weights are applied to observations that are farther from the reference age group. A simple triangular weighting pattern is used, so if the reference group is 25-year-olds with a 5-year bandwidth, then 25-year-olds have weights of one, persons who are one year plus or minus 25 (24- and 26-year-olds) have weights of 0.8, persons who are two years plus or minus 25 (23- and 27-year-olds) have weights of 0.6, persons three years plus or minus 25 (22- and 28-year-olds) have weights of 0.4, persons four years plus or minus 25 (21- and 29-year-olds) have weights of 0.2, and persons five years plus or minus 25 (20- and 30-year-olds) have weights of 0.0.",

There is no smoothing of the estimated effect of independent variables across ages; therefore, if people of different ages are really very different in terms of mean outcomes or the effects of some independent variable, those differences will come through in the estimation.

At the same time, the five-year bandwidths are small enough that one can observe any systematic differences in estimates across the age distribution.

Note that if the bandwidth is set to one, the intercept and age will be perfectly correlated. However, when the bandwidth is greater than one, the age term can be estimated and captures any systematic age differences (within the bandwidth range) not captured by other independent variables. It is probably easiest to think of this coefficient as the derivative by age of the process being estimated, evaluated at that particular reference age. In model simulations, when predicting outcomes for a given observation, the age term is effectively combined with the constant term for each reference age group.<a href=\"#fn3\"><sup>3</sup></a>",

At first glance it might seem that age centring is somewhat more cumbersome, because it replaces one equation for the entire population with separate equations for each age group. However, in practice the actual estimation and implementation are both straightforward. The equations here are all estimated using a simple looping feature in a standard software package, so the actual code for estimating, evaluating, and outputting multiple equations is only slightly more cumbersome than estimating a single equation. (See example code in <a href=\"#appendix1\">appendix</a>.) In the actual CBOLT model code, switching from a single equation to age-centred equations simply involves adding an extra dimension (age) in the coefficient arrays used in the simulation.

In general, more education is associated with higher labour supply for both men and women, while marriage is associated with higher labour supply for men but lower labour supply for women. Receipt of Social Security income has a strong negative effect on labour supply for both men and women. The most dominant effect in the labour force participation equation is from lagged labour force participation, which we focus on below when computing marginal effects. This coefficient shows that persistence in labour supply within the population is a first-order effect that should be accounted for, clearly dominating the magnitude of the other zero-one dummy variables.",

Although the deviation is not too extreme, it is systematically biased upwards for women. For men, the single-equation estimate is biased up for young workers and biased down for older workers, in generally the same direction of bias as the marginal effects of lagged labour force participation noted above.

The effect of imposing a linear coefficient on age comes through clearly for men, as the functional form induces a predicted relationship with age that is linear. As with labour force participation, the higher-order age-terms could improve predicted outcomes but the predictions will only asymptotically approach the age-centred values as higher-order terms are added.",

The situation in which age centring can help is very common: when the behavioural process in question varies systematically by age and the effect of one or more independent variables might also differ across age groups. The basic idea is to estimate separate equations for each age sample, but to include observations that are close to the reference age being estimated. Using the extra information from nearby observations makes it possible to statistically identify how marginal effects and predicted mean outcomes differ across the age distribution under consideration.",
