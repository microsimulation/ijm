                "text": "Population ageing has the potential to disrupt every aspect of society, placing a great deal of stress in particular on our healthcare and welfare systems. To overcome these challenges will require effective policy interventions with effects that may not be truly seen for decades. Policy makers would therefore benefit from a tool that allows them to assess the long-term impact of their decisions on population health. We have developed such a tool by adapting the well-established Future Elderly Model (FEM) developed in the US to use the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. The FEM is a Markov microsimulation model for people aged over 50 that generates input populations and transition probabilities using the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, and can then project the population forward in time assessing the prevalence and incidence of a number of chronic diseases and related economic outputs. By modifying the input populations or transition probabilities, we can use the model to investigate counterfactual scenarios and assess the long-term effects of policy interventions on elderly health. In this paper we describe the model and its workings, provide evidence to validate its outputs, and outline possible applications.",

POPREP was used to assess the impact of different methods of family planning on the rate of conception (<a href=\"#bib7\">Mustafa, 1973</a>). Aside from POPREP, until the 1990s, health microsimulation models were typically static rather than dynamic owing to the computational cost of individual-level modelling compared with macromodels (<a href=\"#bib8\">Schofield et al., 2018</a>). These static microsimulation models rely on static ageing methods, where input microdata is transformed to fit expected demographic and health constraints at the next time step. Examples of these early static models include the evaluation of disease screening (<a href=\"#bib9\">Habbema et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Van Oortmarssen et al., 1981</a>), and assessing fertility (<a href=\"#bib11\">Santow, 1976</a>).",

This is largely owing to the difficulty in creating microsimulation models in the first place - building a model from scratch requires a skilled programmer and a significant time investment.

These frameworks provide a generic toolkit to handle basic functions of microsimulation such as input/output, cross-sectional ageing, event management, and custom scenario generation, leaving researchers who use them to focus on developing models rather than software. Providing these functions in a user-friendly manner reduces the expertise and time needed to create new models from scratch and potentially opens up a range of new possibilities for using microsimulation to answer pertinent policy-relevant questions.",

The FEM uses the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) as the primary data source, which is a longitudinal survey of health and ageing for people over the age of 50 in the US. Many countries around the world have since developed their own longitudinal health surveys based on the HRS, which has enabled comparative research into ageing. These studies are all hosted on the Gateway to Global Aging platform (g2aging.org) which also provides code to harmonise the datasets, linking an individual respondent\u2019s information between waves and generating comparative variables. The comparative nature of these datasets means that the \u2018engine\u2019 on which the FEM runs can be adapted to different nations relatively easily, which not only vastly decreases the time required to develop a microsimulation but offers the potential for cross-national comparison of model outcomes. A key feature is that using harmonized data and a common simulation engine means that differences in projections can be interpreted as true differences between countries, rather than driven by modeling or data issues. An excellent example of this comes from a recent publication from <a href=\"#bib18\">Atella et al. (2021)</a> uses the FEM to compare disease prevalence, Life Expectancy, and inequalities in health outcomes in the future elderly across 12 OECD countries.",

This same group of respondents were interviewed at intervals of two years (known as waves), and any change in state for those individuals was recorded. This allows us to observe the transitions between states over time at the individual level, and to estimate transition models based on related characteristics. In ELSA, the majority of binary response variables are in an absorbing state, which means that once entered, that state cannot be left. For example, when asking about chronic health conditions, the question posed is: \"Has a doctor ever told that you have (or had) any of the following conditions?\" Once a respondent answers \u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019 this state is carried forward to future waves. ELSA is jointly run by teams at University College London (UCL), the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), National Centre for Social Research, and the University of Manchester.",

Mid-year population estimates were used to re-weight by sex and age from 2012 to 2018, and beyond 2018 switched to national population projections. Both of these datasets are produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). For education, there is no widely available and reliable data projecting levels of attainment into the future. Instead, we used data on education levels reported in the 2011 Census, and assumed that the highest level of educational attainment for an individual did not change after the age of 30. Using this assumption, we re-weighted the replenishing populations by education for the first 20 years of simulation, and held the final distribution constant for any waves beyond that.",

For example, a number of physical measurements including height and weight are carried out as part of a visit from a qualified nurse, which happens only every second wave. From wave 2, the nurse visit was only offered to \u2018core sample members\u2019 who had an interview in person, however in wave 8 eligibility for the nursing visit was further determined by sub-sampling.

They reported that this higher attrition could not be fully explained by differences in the survey design or sampling methodology, but were more likely due to cultural differences between North American and European populations when it comes to scientific surveys. Respondents in the lower education group were most likely to attrit in ELSA, and in particular those with low numeracy scores, suggesting a potential source of bias. <a href=\"#bib29\">Banks et al.

As a result of this, the order that these changes are made in the simulation is inconsequential, as each characteristic is simply a function of several factors at time T-1. The order that is important in the E-FEM however is what we describe as the \u2019causal pathway\u2019. That is, risk behaviours lead to chronic disease and functional limitations, which in turn have an impact on economic outcomes. For example, BMI is a predictor of the incidence of stroke, which can lead to functional limitations, which in part predict a respondents working status.

The populations are re-weighted by age, sex, and education, which are all significant predictors for most outcomes. For example, there is an inverse relationship between smoking and education level, where individuals with low educational attainment are more likely to smoke. As smoking is related to a number of chronic diseases in the elderly, the risk therefore of developing these diseases is slightly higher in less educated groups. Over time the proportion of people with higher levels of education is rising, while the proportion of people who are less educated is falling.

As linear interpolation simply fills in the midpoint between known data points, transition models estimated from interpolated data showed that current BMI was wholly predicted by previous BMI. This did not mirror reality, and so we tested adding random noise to the interpolated values to assess if this looked more like observed data. For each interpolated data point, we added a sample from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.05. When testing values for normal distribution, we compared the RMSE term of the BMI transition model with that in the US FEM, and stopped when the terms were roughly equal. <a href=\"#A1-T2\">Table A2</a> in the appendix shows a comparison of mean population BMI between raw and imputed ELSA data at each wave.",

The choice of predictor variables to include in each model was based initially on previous literature, which were then refined iteratively, with the aim of producing parsimonious but well-specified models. The key demographic variables of age, sex, and education were included in every model. Some models are estimated for sub-groups of the population. For example, all individuals are included in the mortality model, only current smokers are included in the model that predicts smoking cessation, and only those who do not and have never had incident heart disease (since it is an absorbing state) are included in the heart disease model.",

By removing heart disease completely, we can investigate its effect on mortality and disability and see how the removal of heart disease affects life expectancy and healthy life expectancy.

CVD is the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 31% of all mortality (<a href=\"#bib35\">WHO, 5AD</a>). In England, it is also one of the largest causes of premature mortality, with 33,812 people under the age of 75 dying from CVD in 2016 alone (<a href=\"#bib36\">Public Health England, 2AD</a>). Mortality data from 2001 to 2016 in England has shown a long-term decline in the death rate from CVD, which is reported as one of the main reasons for the increase in life expectancy over this time period. Whilst mortality from CVD has decreased, morbidity has increased as people live longer with these conditions, which has increased the burden on health and social care. Public Health England (PHE) estimates that annual healthcare costs alone for CVD amount to an estimated \u00a37.4 billion, whilst non-healthcare costs are much higher, estimated at \u00a315.8 billion. CVD is one of the most significant targets for PHE, with numerous ongoing strategies for disease prevention. <a href=\"#table5\">Table 5</a> shows the regression model used to estimate Heart Disease transitions in the E-FEM.",

Validation, both internal and external, demonstrates that the E-FEM is capable of accurately predicting health outcomes and disease states in to the future while results demonstrate that on a whole population and on a cohort the model can inform disease and mortality outcomes under counterfactual scenarios. We show results for a heart disease and a smoking intervention to demonstrate the type of experiments that can be run using the E-FEM but the model can be used to estimate a wide range of potential outcomes.",

Limitations with ELSA have been discussed in this paper but in brief relate to bias and the representativeness of the data, missing values and changing data collection methods. The first of these have been mitigated somewhat by scaling to other data (Census, mid-year estimates and projections) and through imputation.",

There are a couple of possible contributing factors at play that mean cancer prevalence and mortality may not wholly be captured by ELSA, as well as other reasons why cancer may be difficult to predict from this data. Firstly, the time between diagnosis and death is often short for cancer, which gets progressively worse with age. For example in lung cancer, the 1-year survival rate for someone diagnosed between ages 55-64 is 44.7%, whereas the same diagnosis between ages 75-99 has a 1-year survival rate of 32.0% (<a href=\"#bib45\">ONS, 2019b</a>). There is therefore a significant chance that a respondent diagnosed with cancer between waves may not survive to the next wave. Secondly, cancer is one of the leading reasons for the need for palliative care. As previously stated, respondents who move into assisted living facilities (including palliative care) are given an analysis weight of zero, effectively removing them from our analyses. Thirdly, current predictors taken from ELSA (for example BMI, smoking status) may not be adequate for the prediction of cancer in this case. Further information such as family history, pack-years for smokers, or other environmental exposures may be necessary to improve the model. Also given that different types of cancer can have very specific behavioural and genetic risks, it may be inadequate to predict incidence of all types of cancer with a single set of predictor variables. Finally, cancer could be more of a \u2019random shock\u2019 than other diseases, meaning prediction of it is more difficult than other diseases even with perfect data.",
