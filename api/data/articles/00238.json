The first one, by Luke Archer, Nik Lomax and Bryan Tysinger, describes the English Future Elderly Model, an adaptation of the well-established Future Elderly Model (FEM) developed in the US to the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (FEM plays a big part in the special issue of Health Economics on ageing, referenced below). The second article, by Santtu Tikka, Jussi Hakanen, Mirka Saarela and Juha Karvanen, is also a health microsimulation paper, where the authors describe a newly developed open source microsimulation structure in R. We then have another contribution by Finnish authors, introducing a new indicator for life course partitioning \u2014a follow up on <a href=\"#bib2\">Salonen et al. (2020)</a>, also published in this journal. The fourth article, by Alice Richardson and co-authors, is another contribution to health microsimulation, where the authors estimate the impact of a proposed tax on sugar sweetened beverage in Australia across small areas. Finally, the paper by Cristina Cirillo, Lucia Imperioli and Marco Manzo introduces a new microsimulation model for indirect taxes in Italy.",
