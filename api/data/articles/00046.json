SADNAP is being developed for calculating the financial and economic implications of the ageing of the population and of the ageing-related policy measures that are being proposed to cope with ageing. The model uses administrative datasets of Dutch public pension payments and entitlements for both public and private pensions.

For the modelling of income redistribution a new micro data source with individual data on private pensions is combined with differentiation of mortality rates in order to gain a better insight in the income at the individual level within the population of pensioners. For the modelling of the retirement decision an option value model is developed in which key parameters vary at the individual level in order to benefit from the micro simulation approach. These extensions greatly enhance the performance of SADNAP. Besides the financial implications, additional insight can now be provided into the effects of policy measures on a set of key indicators.",

Per person average second-pillar pension savings are almost equal now to the average first pillar state pension savings. In the future, it is to be expected that second and third-pillar pensions together will provide more than half of the average pension income. Although there are many second-pillar pension funds in the Netherlands, each with its own rules on contributions and pensions, broadly speaking one can say that pension funds try to supplement the state pension to a total gross income level of 70% of the pensioner\u2019s final wage. Most pension funds have recently switched from a final wage system to a career average system, but on average they still aim for a gross pension level of 70% of the final wage. Because pensioners no longer have to pay state pension contributions, the net height of their first and second-pillar pensions together usually, in the case of a full pension, comes close to 90% of the final wage. Other income sources, like third-pillar pensions can add to this income level.",

The budget horizon is six years (the current budget for 2010 contains forecasts from 2009 until 2014). Although beyond the budget horizon, the long-term forecast of pension expenses is of great importance as well because government budgets are also affected by the long-term sustainability of public finance. Besides the financial effects for the government budget, the Minister of Social Affairs and Employment is also responsible for income policies and labour participation policies. When new policy options are discussed, a broad analysis of both short-term and long-term financial effects, income effects and labour participation effects will be required. Moreover, in the case of ageing-related policy measures, income effects will not be limited to direct effects on purchasing power but will include intra-generational and inter-generational redistribution issues as well. In order to assess all these effects, a number of different models are used.",

These volume forecasts are supplied by the state pension administration office (SVB). The macro model calculates the costs by multiplying the expected group sizes with the average pensions for each group. As the SVB forecasts project ahead as far as 2024 and rely heavily on extrapolating existing trends, for the long-term development of the state pension expenses, the Ministry relies on a macro AGE model of CPB. This model, called GAMMA (<a href=\"#bib22\">see Van Ewijk et al., 2006</a>), is used once every four years (in the run-up to the general elections) for a long-term forecast of the whole Dutch economy. For income effects, the long running static micro simulation model Micros (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hendrix, 1993</a>) has been used since the early 1990s. This model focuses on the short-term income effects of complex sets of policy measures. Labour participation effects are quantified on an ad-hoc basis using recent research papers by CPB and others.

Age groups are not included, for example, although among the population of persons aged 65 and over, different ages may have very different characteristics. Second, there are certain features of the AOW that cannot simply be taken into account with macro models, such as changes in migration patterns and changes in household situation. Migration affects the entitlements to the AOW because the AOW- entitlement depends on citizenship. Changes in the number and age of immigrants and emigrants will affect the pension expenses later on. The AOW-entitlement also depends on household situation. Two single persons receive a higher pension than two persons in a couple, so when the number of singles among the population of pensioners rises, the cost of the AOW will rise as well. Third, the macro models are limited to the state pensions, that provide the basic income level, whereas the main differences in the income positions of pensioners are caused by private pensions. The Micros model, which is used for the income effects, is a static model that is not capable of adequate long-term forecasts.

Static micro simulation does not allow characteristics to change. Although in static simulations reweighing techniques can be used to allow for changes in population composition, static micro simulation is usually seen as more suited for short-term forecasts, like the short-term impact of fiscal measures, whereas dynamic micro simulation is seen as more suited for long-term forecasts like the impact of ageing.",

Of course, a larger sample can reduce the fluctuations between different runs with the model, but not eliminate them. Moreover, in large dynamic micro simulations sample size can still be limited due to disk capacity or computer speed. One can deal with the Monte Carlo variability in several ways. First, several simulations can be done and an average outcome can be calculated. The difference in average outcome between the base situation and the policy alternative can then be accounted to the policy change. A second approach is proposed by <a href=\"#bib29\">Klevmarken (2007)</a>, who describes a calibration technique in which the simulation results are aligned to an a priori defined target, such as a macro forecast, eliminating the variability. Third, Monte Carlo variance can be avoided completely by using a fixed set of random numbers used to generate the events. This last method is useful to allow for replication of model results and to compare policy alternatives to the base situation, because when the random numbers are fixed, differences between two simulations can only be caused by the policy change. For every individual a simulation of a policy alternative can then be performed under exactly the same conditions as the simulation of the baseline scenario. In SADNAP, both calibration and fixing of random numbers are used.",

An early project description is documented in Van der Werf, Van Sonsbeek and Gradus (2007). In later years, the original demographic modules have been extended. The immigration and emigration code has been improved in order to allow for the interdependency between the two (immigrants having a higher emigration rate). Also, the take-up of state pensions by former emigrants has been incorporated in the model. The household formation code has been improved in order to provide reliable relationship patterns at the micro level.

The only comparable model in the Netherlands is the NEDYMAS model (<a href=\"#bib36\">Nelissen, 1993</a>), which was prominent during the 1990s. Although SADNAP, as compared to some well-known international simulation models, is a comparatively simple and small-scale project, it shares some key characteristics with these larger models. Cassels, <a href=\"#bib12\">Harding and Kelly (2006)</a> present an overview of six large dynamic population micro simulation models (Dynasim3 from the USA, Dynacan from Canada, Mosart from Norway, Sesim from Sweden, Sage from the UK and Dynamod from Australia). Like all the models but Dynamod, SADNAP is a discrete model with one year time steps. The development platform is SAS, as in Dynasim3. The sample size (1-2%) is comparable to most models (e.g. Dynacan, Mosart, Dynamod). The time horizon (2080) is also comparable to for example, Dynacan and Mosart (2100). In SADNAP results are aligned to targets taken from macro data sources. As in, Dynacan, for example, alignment targets include rates for mortality, fertility, migration, marriage and divorce propensities. As in most of the models mentioned, SADNAP contains modules on population, household formation, labour force participation, benefits and taxation.",

For example, household formation in SADNAP is a binary choice between single and cohabiting, which excludes, for example, children leaving home, people moving in and out institutions and adults living in other households without family relations (cf. Mosart). Taxation is included in SADNAP as in most other models (except Dynacan) but is simplified to the main tariff structure. Education and health are abstracted from SADNAP. Financial wealth and savings are also abstracted, but they are planned for an extension in the future. SADNAP is comparatively narrow in scope, like for example Dynacan, so most effort is put into subjects directly related to pensions and ageing. In the current SADNAP version, most effort has been put into the retirement decision model, which consequently is comparatively elaborate.",

However, there are also notable differences in mortality rates between different income levels, between single persons and couples and between different ethnicities.

This contrasts with data from <a href=\"#bib46\">SVB (2008)</a> showing the mortality age of people not born in the Netherlands, to be significantly lower than that of people born in the Netherlands, with differences in average mortality age of more than 10 years between natives and Turks and Moroccans.

He finds a distribution with 50% of discount rates between 0.03 and 0.15 but also a large number of outliers with about 5% having negative discount rates of \u22120.15 and below and 20% having discount rates of 0.2 and above.

The option value approach computes an expected retirement age based on a forward-looking calculation. In reality, events like unemployment and disability will influence the retirement decision.

From the simulation results, it appears that not only does the size of the population of pensioners change but that its composition changes as well. In particular, three trends are important. First, when studying the composition of the pensioner population by origin, it appears that the share of immigrants is rising. This holds true especially for the first generation immigrants. Their share in the population aged 65 and over almost doubles from 8.7% in 2009 to 15.6% in 2040. Most first generation immigrants have an incomplete state pension (unless they immigrated to the Netherlands before age 15). Emigrants will also have a reduced state pension and their number is growing as well. The number of reduced pensions is therefore rising, from 15.0% in 2009 to 27.5% in 2040.",

In the short term the share of cohabitants among pensioners is increasing. This reflects the trend seen in recent state pension realizations and is caused by the increasing life expectancy. Partners live together for a longer time after reaching the age of 65. For the same reason, in a recent study by <a href=\"#bib41\">Poos et al. (2008)</a>, a decrease in health care costs is predicted for the forthcoming decade. However, after 2020 the percentage of singles starts increasing again. This can be explained by the socio-economic trend that fewer people become cohabitant or married. This trend finally overshadows the current trend of increasing numbers of cohabitants because of the rising life expectancy. Already in 2040, the share of single persons among pensioners is above the current level. After 2040 the share of singles will stabilize at a level above the current and put additional pressure on state pension costs.",

In fact, the majority of men turning 65 currently qualifies for the partner allowance. However, as the labour participation among women is rising, this number will be decreasing in the future. Therefore, the costs of the partner allowances will grow slowly until 2013, then stabilize more or less on the same level and decrease slowly after 2035. In the meantime the share of women in the age category 60\u201364 who participate in the labour market will have doubled. In 2040 the costs of the partner allowance will be almost equal to 2009.",

As the models, like the option value approach we use, only take the latter into account, they usually underestimate the spikes. For the Netherlands, <a href=\"#bib37\">Nelissen (2002)</a> finds a strong preference for individuals to retire either at the first or the last possible retirement age. In the Netherlands, the first possible retirement age used to be 60 years in many sectors. Since the late 1980s for most employees a generous early retirement scheme existed that guaranteed an income level of 70\u201380% of the final wage without loss of pension accruals from 60 years of age onwards. As a result, most people did indeed retire at age 60 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Euwals, de Mooij &amp; van Vuuren, 2009</a>). Gradually, the generous early retirement schemes are being replaced by actuarially neutral schemes until, from 2015 onwards, all schemes are fully actuarially neutral (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bovenberg &amp; Gradus, 2008</a>). The last possible retirement age in the Netherlands for most employees is still 65. At that age, the state pension starts being paid and most employees automatically have their employment terminated. However, the Dutch government has sent a proposal to parliament to abolish the automatic process of employees being fired at 65 and to allow delaying the state pension to 70 years of age instead of the current 65.",

However, the number of people working on past 65 is slightly higher than the levels currently seen, especially for women. The abolition of the automatic termination of employees at 65, which is expected soon, will probably influence current retirement patterns. Moreover, it is known (<a href=\"#bib16\">Coile, 2004</a>) that husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 retirement behaviour is influenced not only by their own financial incentives but also by spill-over effects from their spouses\u2019 incentives, which may explain why women\u2019s retirement age is overestimated by the option value algorithm. The SADNAP estimates may give a good estimate of the retirement patterns that will be realized when the automatic firing of employees at 65 has been abolished and when all early retirement schemes that are rewarding early retirement are abolished. However, it remains to be seen whether such a substantial part of the whole population of males and females will retire at the last possible retirement age when that last possible retirement age is increased to 70.",

In this paper, two extensions of the model are elaborated. First, because of improvement of the income data sources and differentiation of mortality rates, redistribution within the pensions system can be analysed. Second, the retirement decision is modelled based on the Stock and Wise option value approach, allowing for individual variation in the main option value parameters based on literature review in order to make use of the added value of micro simulation.",

In the actuarially neutral scheme, a strong preference for either retiring at 65 or at the last retirement age is suggested. The time preference and leisure preference parameters appear to be the most important drivers for the retirement decision. An assumption of wage decrease is added to the model in order to obtain more plausible results and less people working on until the last possible retirement age. Another important factor is the role of disability and unemployment. The unemployment scheme especially is still used as an early retirement pathway.",

Aggregate CBS data on the population aged 0\u201315 years are used in the base year. For the population aged 15\u201364 years, the micro datasets from CBS on state pension entitlements and private pension entitlements as described in Section 3.2 are used. Finally the micro dataset from SVB on state pension payments as described in Section 3.1 is used for the population aged 65 and over. These three datasets complete the population for the base year. The records for people younger than 15 years are constructed by using general demographic CBS statistics on the age, gender and ethnic composition of the Dutch population. As state pension entitlements are zero until persons turn 15, and children do not have wages or private pension entitlements, no additional information on this group is needed.",

A population can change by four demographic events; births, deaths, immigration, and emigration. Births do not affect the population aged 15\u201364 in one year of simulation. Therefore, the 2005 population is made subject to mortality, immigration, and emigration. After this first simulation the 2005 population is aged 16\u201365. Because richer data are available for people aged over 65 in 2006, persons aged 65 are deleted from the simulation. All age groups are added together to complete the base dataset.",

This is important because on average during the last few years about 50% of the emigrants are former immigrants and about 20% of the immigrants are former emigrants. By not allowing for remigration, the share of immigrants in the population will clearly be overestimated. The former (immigrants having a greater emigration rate) can easily be implemented by using different sets of emigration rates depending on whether the emigrant was born in the Netherlands or not. The latter is more difficult. Few of the larger simulation models, notably Lifepaths and Sesim (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pennec &amp; Keegan, 2007</a>) allow for emigrants re-entering the population. SADNAP ignores repatriation of emigrants, resulting at the micro level in a slight overrepresentation of small entitlements as returning emigrants continue building up their already existing rights, whereas SADNAP assumes these rights to consist of separate parts belonging to two separate persons.",

As can be seen from <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>, 9% of the current population of pensioners is living abroad. Since emigration is modelled, the model captures all future pensioners who live in the Netherlands in the base year, but will emigrate in the future. However, we still miss the people aged between 15 and 64 in the base year who built up state pension entitlements in the Netherlands in the past but emigrated before the base year. To correct for this, records are added for former emigrants. As a starting point, the youngest cohort of pensioners in the base year is used. Of this cohort also 9% of the pensioners are living abroad. From the state pension entitlement, their year of emigration can be estimated. Everybody missing one year of entitlement is assumed to have emigrated at age 64, everybody missing two years at age 63 and so on. As in the simulation, people aged 64 in the base year can emigrate in the first year of the simulation, after that first year of the simulation only the claimants living abroad who emigrated at age 63 or younger have to be added. According to <a href=\"#bib46\">SVB (2008)</a>, non-take-up among people living abroad is common, hence a correction is made, based on the assumption that the younger one emigrated, the less likely one is to claim a Dutch state pension.",

Those models contain a formalized mate matching module in which partners are found within the model based on certain matching criteria (for an overview of methods see <a href=\"#bib40\">Perese (2002)</a> and for an overview of models see <a href=\"#bib3\">Bacon and Pennec (2007)</a>). SADNAP follows a simple approach, in which the important characteristics of the partner are determined as soon as those characteristics become relevant for the model calculations. In the ageing calculations the gender, age and participation status of the partner are the most important characteristics. The gender of the partner is assumed always to be the opposite of the gender of the other partner. From the dataset of state pension payments, detailed information on the age difference between partners of a couple is available. The age differences from the youngest cohort of this dataset (the 1941 birth cohort) are used, assuming that the distribution of age differences in relationships will remain the same in the future. Given the gender and age of a partner, the corresponding participation rate can be derived from the age and gender specific participation estimates as described in Section 3.3. At this point enough information is available to calculate the costs of the state pension. Information is available on the future population size and its division by ages. Starting with current state pension entitlements, the building up of entitlements in the future can be simulated. As information on the household type is also available, by adding benefit levels to the model, the future state pension benefits of all individuals can be simulated. The total costs for the state pension can be calculated by aggregating the individual benefits. All calculations within the model are done at the current price level.",

Also, there is a correlation between first and second pillar pensions. People with high company pensions more often have a complete state pension, whereas people with incomplete state pension entitlements more often have smaller or no company pensions. Rather surprising though, is that people with reduced state pension entitlements tend to have higher wages than people with complete entitlements. However, this only holds true for the population of employees, 7 In 2005, the maximum state pension for a single person was \u20ac 11,211 and for a partner in a couple \u20ac 8,008. which indicates that people who have lived abroad for a while tend to have higher than average wages.

The high replacement rates of women are due to the large share of women in the Netherlands who during their life-course change to part-time jobs whereas pension savings up till then may have been based on fulltime jobs. The higher replacement rates of singles are due to the higher first pillar state pension for which they qualify. The replacement rates tend to decrease by age. This is partly due to younger cohorts having higher second-pillar pension savings, although it should be kept in mind that in a career average system, replacement rates will go down with age as wages tend to grow with age and replacement rates are related to the final wage. Also the very high replacement rates among the youngest age groups need explanation. In the Netherlands a full minimum wage can only be earned at 23 years of age. Wages paid to workers below that age tend to be lower, whereas expected private pensions take account of the wage increase due to legal requirements.

This fourth pillar is known to play a role in the retirement decision (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bloemen, 2008</a>) and can also be particularly important when intergenerational wealth transfers are researched.",

From this projection, which runs from 2008 to 2050, we take the number of births and the number of immigrants by age and gender per year. Also mortality rates and emigration rates by age and gender are deducted from this projection. Although this official projection is used in the baseline scenario, by including the underlying processes of emigration, immigration, births and deaths, the model allows for analyses of alternative scenarios in which (policy-driven) changes, for example, in immigration or emigration levels can be represented. In SADNAP, a narrow definition of ethnicity is used, distinguishing only between natives and immigrants (people not born in the Netherlands) as distinguishing between second generation nonnatives and natives is not important for the state pension entitlements.",

In SADNAP only single persons and cohabitants are distinguished, based on the social benefits for which they qualify. The remainder group \u2013 people living together without having a relationship \u2013 are considered to be single persons.

These are average participation rates for five-year age classes by gender. From these five-year averages, participation rates for individual ages can be deducted. These participation rates include all persons who are available to the labour market, including the involuntarily unemployed who are actively seeking work. The non-participants are mainly students, disability benefit recipients, the early retired and the voluntarily unemployed (e.g. housewives). SADNAP currently lacks a model of benefit use during the life course. However, benefit use plays an important role in determining the net effects of ageing-related policy measures, like raising the retirement age. Therefore, in SADNAP the final state of benefit use at the age of 64 is modelled. It is assumed that benefit use at that high ages is an absorbing state (outflow rates are near zero). In 2005, based on the CBS dataset, 27% of the 64 year olds were in receipt of benefits: 17% from the disability insurance scheme, 2% from the unemployment insurance scheme, 4% from social assistance and 4% from other benefits. Because of the major reform of the DI scheme, the use of disability benefits will decline in the future. Long-term disability rates are based on current long-term forecasts based on the model described in <a href=\"#bib44\">Van Sonsbeek and Gradus (2006)</a>. In the meantime, the unemployment scheme has also undergone major reforms, limiting the duration of the benefit from a maximum of 7.5 years in 2003 to a maximum of just over 3 years in 2006. However, as <a href=\"#bib20\">Euwals, de Mooij and van Vuuren (2009)</a> conclude that, as a result of the reforms of DI and early retirement schemes, pressure on UI may increase in the near future, it seems plausible to keep long-term rates for the other benefits constant at the 2005 level.",
