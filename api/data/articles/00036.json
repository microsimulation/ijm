This has meant an increased need for small area statistics. The need for small area statistics often cannot be addressed using direct estimates from survey data because most surveys use samples that are designed to provide reliable information for national level estimates, but nothing smaller. As a result it is usually impossible to derive estimates for small areas using sample surveys, and to derive a sample that would allow estimates for small areas would be inefficient (<a href=\"#bib14\">Heady, et al., 2003</a>).",

Spatial microsimulation uses the microdata to estimate the condition of persons, families or households in a specific small area.

The SLA is one type of standard spatial unit derived by the ABS and described in the Australian Standard Geographic Classification 2006 (<a href=\"#bib2\">ABS, 2007</a>). There were two main reasons why the SLA was used as the unit of analysis in this study. First, the SLA is the smallest unit in the ASGC where there are no substantial issues with confidentiality. The ABS randomises any cells in tables where the number of people is less than 3, and as an area gets less populous, the chance of getting too many randomised cells increases. Second, SLAs cover the whole of Australia (as opposed to Local Government Areas which do not cover areas with no local government) and cover contiguous areas (unlike some postcodes) (<a href=\"#bib16\">McNamara, <i>et al.</i>, 2008</a>)",

The technique uses a calibration estimator initially outlined by Singh and Mohl (<a href=\"#bib18\">Singh and Mohl, 1996</a>) and described and implemented by the ABS (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bell, 2000</a>) in a SAS macro called GREGWT. The SAS macro program is commonly used within the Australian Bureau of Statistics to benchmark survey datasets to known population targets, generally at the national or state level. In contrast, SpatialMSM uses this process to create a synthetic household microdata file for each Statistical Local Area (SLA) in Australia, containing a set of synthetic household weights which replicate, as closely as possible, the characteristics of the real households living within each small area in Australia (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chin and Harding, 2007</a>).",

If there is no solution found after a number of iterations (which can be set by the user and for SpatialMSM is set at 30), then the process has not converged. Those SLAs where the process does not converge are usually SLAs where the population is quite different to the sample population \u2013 so for instance, industrial estates or inner city areas. For many areas, however, we found that the original GREGWT criteria for non-convergence was too strict: even after iterating 30 times and not converging, the estimate of the population for each benchmark obtained from the weights was still reasonable when compared with the benchmarks. In order to maximise the number of SLAs for which we could produce valid data, SpatialMSM uses the total absolute error (TAE) from all the benchmarks as a criteria for reweighting accuracy. If the total absolute error from all the benchmarks is greater than the population in that SLA, then the SLA is dropped from any further analysis. This is called the Total Absolute Error (TAE) criteria (rather than non-convergence). The TAE has been used in a number of spatial microsimulation models (<a href=\"#bib5\">Anderson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Williamson, et al., 1998</a>).",

This meant that more populous areas could experience greater error. While there is no statistical basis for this value, testing has found that it is sufficiently high to keep areas where the estimates are reasonable, and low enough to exclude areas where the estimates are unreasonable.",

There were 138 SLAs where the method did not appear to work, and this was shown in the failed TAE criteria. These SLAs have been dropped from further analysis. We found that most of the SLAs with failed TAE criteria were usually industrial areas, office areas or military bases with very low population size. Therefore, the proportion of persons living in these SLAs is very small (<a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a>). Only 0.7% of the total Australian population in 2006 were lost due to a failed TAE criteria. Having said this, the process did not work for many areas in the Northern Territory, and 25 per cent of the Northern Territory population had to be dropped due to failed TAE. Therefore, small area estimates for the Northern Territory from SpatialMSM/08c should be treated cautiously.",
