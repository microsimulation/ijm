Starting from household-level data from the Survey on Household Income and Wealth and matching them with macroeconomic forecasts on debt and income, we project the future path of households\u2019 indebtedness and debt-service ratio. This allows us to assess households\u2019 vulnerability at a higher frequency and in a more timely manner than by using household data alone. We find that the share of vulnerable households (defined as those with a debt-service ratio above 30 per cent and income below the median) over the total population is projected to be about stable between 2012 and 2014, with a slight decrease in 2015 due to positive income growth. Their debt is also projected to decrease in those years. Overall, we find that the dynamics of income growth are the main driver of households\u2019 vulnerability.",

After a long period of feeble positive GDP growth, the Italian economy was exposed to the 2007\u20132009 financial crisis and to the 2011\u201312 sovereign debt crisis, whose effects are still in place. In such a scenario, although household debt has been historically low by international standards<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup>, the recent increase in unemployment, along with the weak dynamics of disposable income, affected the households\u2019 ability to meet their debt obligations. Nonetheless, the adverse consequences have been partially mitigated by the low interest rates (see <a href=\"#bib17\">Magri and Pico, 2014</a>, for an analysis of the impact of the crisis on household debt).",

These households are considered more likely to be affected by shocks associated with important changes in interest rates or income. Their sensitivity to shocks is greater when income is low; hence, in this paper we focus on households with income below the median in the population. In most of what follows we define as vulnerable those households with a debt-service ratio above 30 per cent and an income below the median, consistently with previous studies on the Italian economy (<a href=\"#bib16\">Magri &amp; Pico, 2012</a>). Our flexible framework allows different definitions of financial vulnerability to be considered, in line with other studies (Bank of Canada, 2012; IMF, 2010): in particular, we also investigate the financial vulnerability of Italian households under a less stringent debt-service ratio threshold of 40 per cent.",

Therefore, we first distinguish households according to their income class. For each income class we estimate the parameters of the income process using historical microeconomic data and we allow households to have different income realizations. We then require that the income growth generated by the model be consistent with the growth in nominal income from macroeconomic projections. Secondly, we impose some structure on the debt evolution by assuming that indebted households repay their mortgage according to a French amortization schedule, which implies that the annual repayment is constant until loan termination and the annual interest expense is calculated on outstanding debt. Annual repayments may be subject to variations for variable interest rate mortgages only, due to changes in the interest rate. Mortgage debt associated with new originations is determined starting from microeconomic estimates, which are then properly readjusted to match the macroeconomic data on total mortgage debt growth. By combining those projections of income, debt and debt payments we can compute the projected share of vulnerable households over time. More precisely, since the SHIW at the time of writing is available up to 2012, we make use of macroeconomic data to simulate the evolution of indebted households from 2013 to 2015 under different scenarios. In this regard, our model also fits in the growing literature on nowcasting, as it provides a granular and accurate picture of the indebtedness of Italian households almost in real-time. A back-testing exercise is performed on previous SHIW waves and, overall, the model provides a good fit of the data.",

As a way of example, the IMF usually assesses the vulnerability of the household sector in its Financial Sector Assessment Program missions (see e.g. <a href=\"#bib12\">IMF, 2013</a>). A recent contribution is <a href=\"#bib1\">Ampudia <i>et al</i>. (2014)</a>, where a series of metrics for measuring the financial fragility of Euro Area households is proposed. The results of our exercise are consistent with the outcome of that paper. One of the closest papers to ours is <a href=\"#bib6\">Djoudad (2010)</a>, which performs a similar exercise on Canadian data. While building on that paper, we enhance the methodology, providing further contributions to current modelling of households\u2019 vulnerability in several respects. First of all, we impose some structure in the evolution of debt for existing mortgages by having each household paying a loan instalment determined according to a standard amortization formula and its specific debt characteristics. Hence, we do not empirically estimate a process for total debt growth of existing mortgages starting from the empirical data. In fact, our approach does not require any estimation of the process of total debt growth, which could produce estimates that are not statistically significant when the number of indebted households is relatively small in the total population. Moreover, for each household we compute its loan payment in each period using the standard amortization formula. Thus, we do not keep the share of principal on current credit balance fixed. We believe that keeping that share fixed may have significant consequences on the evolution of households\u2019 debt in the short-to-medium run as well.<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> Moreover, as the formula incorporates parameters that are important in the simulation of stress test scenarios, we believe that our approach is more accurate when computing each household\u2019s loan payment and, subsequently, total aggregates.",

This is a major advantage of the SHIW compared with other surveys that do not provide such data. It avoids making arbitrary assumptions on mortgage termination that could lead to biases in debt evolution. Finally, we present a way of introducing mortgage originations obtained from a pseudo-panel that builds on historical data, adjusted to match the total amount of debt using macroeconomic forecasts.",

Thus, we concentrated on carefully simulating the evolution of debt (both the existing stock and new originations) and income, whose changes in the short-to-medium run could have significant effects on the stability of the entire system. Instead, we maintain the other socio-economic household characteristics constant, with the only exception of the household\u2019s age. We believe that this assumption is reasonable given the time horizon simulated. The model, however, could be extended rather easily to introduce time variation for demographic characteristics.

That share is expected to decrease between 2012 and 2015, moving to about 4.4 per cent. As reported in <a href=\"#table7\">Table 7</a>, the confidence interval for this value is rather narrow as 80 per cent of the observations are comprised within 4.3 and 4.5 per cent. In 2013, the reduction in the share of vulnerable households is driven by the decrease in the interest rate as households with variable interest rate mortgages pay lower instalments. To a minor extent that reduction is also associated with negative credit growth. In 2014 and in 2015 positive income growth drives the low share of vulnerable households, which decreases slightly relative to 2013. In particular, in 2015 the expected increase in income growth is even larger than in 2014, but at the same time the increase in total debt growth in the economy generates an increase in indebted households, inducing a composition effect. However, in line with the supply conditions observed in recent years, it can be argued that new loans are mostly given to non-vulnerable households<sup><a href=\"#fn19\">19</a></sup> and, as a result, in 2015 new originations can only explain about 0.4 percentage points of the increase in the share of vulnerable households.<sup><a href=\"#fn20\">20</a></sup>",

Starting from the SHIW microeconomic data and incorporating some macroeconomic projections on income growth, total debt growth and interest rates, we built a model that captures the evolution of households\u2019 debt and vulnerability over time. The micro-founded model delivers aggregate variables that are in line with projected macroeconomic statistics and is therefore suitable for simulating stress scenarios to evaluate households\u2019 resilience to negative shocks, such as income or interest rate shocks. The model is also well suited to study the effects of stress scenarios, alternative policy measures or the effects associated with the suspension of loan payments driven by banks\u2019 decisions.",

Households facing spells of unemployment of different severity and duration may become vulnerable and so could raise the percentage of vulnerable households. Other important factors of vulnerability which can be simulated starting from our microdata could be incorporated. For instance, changes in household composition due to birth of a child or divorce may affect the income committed to debt repayment and thus the ability to service the debt. Second, we could try to incorporate other sources of macroeconomic data when modelling new mortgage originations. Third, we could study other indicators of households\u2019 vulnerability and accordingly evaluate their evolution over time. Fourth, we could improve our modelling approach for consumer credit debt.",
