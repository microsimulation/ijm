It is obvious that this high nonresponse will not only decrease sample size and correspondingly increase variances of estimates from these data, but the results might also become biased if response is selective. There is a large literature on methods to compensate for nonresponse ranging from calibration methods including standard post stratification, imputations, and to more sophisticated model-based methods. The key to a successful compensation is to understand the causes of nonresponse. This is also important because of its relevance to survey design, where resources have to be allocated between the possibly conflicting goals of increasing the precision of estimates and reducing nonresponse biases.",

These attempts have been constrained by the usually very limited information available in the sampling frames. Researchers have then resorted to comparisons between the responding part of the sample and results from smaller but intensive studies of nonresponding sample members using the assumption that those who could be converted tell us something about those who belong to the hard core of nonresponders. They have also compared to larger surveys with more reliable measures and population statistics. Only rarely it has been possible to match individual survey records to reliable register data for the same individuals. The situation is somewhat different in panel surveys, because in a panel one can use information given by the respondents in a previous wave of data collection to explain response behavior in a more recent wave, see for instance, <a href=\"#bib2\">Brose and Klevmarken (1993)</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">Lepkowski and Couper (2002)</a> and <a href=\"#bib14\">Nicoletti and Peracchi (2005)</a>.

They did that by separately analysing contact and cooperation. Contactability is primarily a function of physical barriers to accessing the respondents, the households at home pattern, interview mode and the contact schedule of the interviewers. The explanation of cooperation is more complex, it involves the interaction of survey design, survey topics covered, the organization behind the survey and its perceived motives to carry out the survey, interviewer behaviour, and demographic, socioeconomic and psychological influences on the respondent.",

It is not clear why this is so. One explanation is that there are many multi-family houses in urban areas with access limited by entry barriers of various kinds. Another explanation is that people spend less time at home in urban areas. Commuting takes time and there is a greater supply of out-of-home events. It is also possible that crime rates are higher in urban areas and that the trust in other people is weaker. One is thus more reluctant to let an interviewer into one\u2019s home. Still another potential explanation is that the share of singles and small families is higher in urban areas than in rural. Households with more adults and with children are easier to contact because the probability that someone will be at home is higher.

These results were obtained after controlling for if the household was a single person household. It is well-known that it is more difficult to gain the cooperation of persons who live alone than that of persons who live in multi-person households. Many elderly are singles, and according to <a href=\"#bib6\">Groves and Couper (1998)</a> old age does not decrease the probability of cooperation once one has controlled for household size. The smaller co-operation rate of single-adult households is interpreted as a result of less social integration of these households.

They also tested the hypothesis that households that were hard to contact have other characteristics than households who were easy to contact.

Married people with a working spouse were not more difficult to contact than others, and if the spouse worked long hours the probability to cooperate was even higher than average. The presence of children had no significant effect on contact and cooperation for married sample members, but for unmarried, children aged 6 - 17 increased the probability of contact. Other results were very much in line with those of previous studies: renters and sample members living in big cities had relatively high noncontact rates, while they did not differ from average in cooperation. Households with low or missing incomes were both difficult to contact and unwilling to cooperate. The more schooling the higher contact and cooperation rates.",

Statistics Sweden had mailing addresses to everyone \u2013 the address on which the respondents had registered with the tax authorities \u2013 and through computerized telephone directories they could get telephone numbers to most of the respondents. However, it is possible to be registered on one address and live somewhere else, for instance old people might have kept their old home while they in fact stay for a longer or shorter period in a nursing home. In this case they might not even have a private telephone. Many Swedes have secondary homes and when they are retired, they sometimes live there for longer or shorter periods, not only in the summer. Cell phones have become very common and should in principles increase the chances to reach people, but the telephone directories have not always had full coverage of all cell phone numbers. Some people opt in favor of only having a cell phone and no conventional phone, but this is not as common among elderly people. According to the surveys of the Swedish National Post and Telecom Agency 95 percent of the Swedish population 16 - 75 has a regular telephone and 3 percent has no telephone. About 90 percent has a mobile cell telephone.<sup><a href=\"#fn7\">7</a></sup> In our survey contacting people meant to get the right telephone number and then get them on the phone. As usual many attempts were made at varying times of the day and at different days of the week. At the end of the fieldwork telephone numbers were still missing for 70 respondents and one respondent had a protected number. This is about what one could have expected given the telephone coverage in Sweden.",

All interviewing was done from the \u00d6rebro office of Statistics Sweden and interviewers thus called to all areas of the country. The area in which the respondent lives is thus not confounded with interviewer. Because the CATI system allocated respondents to the interviewers without knowing \u201cthe track record of the interviewer\u201d it is a plausible hypothesis that any interviewer effects are independent of effects depending on the characteristics of the respondents. There is though one exception: The more difficult cases, which remained after the main field period had ended, were in the nonresponse follow up turned over to the most skilled interviewers.",

For instance, as shown in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a> there is virtually no difference in the response behavior of males and females, but we still prefer to include this variable in our multivariate analysis, because gender might be confounded with other variables and while it is often available in sampling frames it is of interest to find out if there is any partial effect. We expect to find that females have a higher probability of contact than males, because they are less mobile and more frequently at home. Their probability of cooperation might, however, be lower. Even if the time-cost of working females usually is somewhat lower than for males, because females have lower wages, females tend to be more sensitive to the issues of invasion of privacy and this effect might dominate.",

This variable is unfortunately not included in our register data, but we have a measure of a monthly wage rate. Because many sample members are retired, they do not have any wage rate. One approach to obtain a time-cost measure for those who do not work, is to estimate a wage rate for them had they worked. This can be achieved if a labor supply and an earnings function are estimated jointly with the contact (cooperation) function; for an application to panel data see <a href=\"#bib2\">Brose and Klevmarken (1993)</a>. In our case it is probably not very meaningful to estimate such wage rates for people who have retired, some many years ago. Very few Swedes work after the age of 65. Instead, we have chosen to use the wage rate measure only for those who have a wage. It is expected to have a negative effect on cooperation. If there is any contact effect it might also be negative. People with high wage rates tend to work long hours and might be difficult to reach. In addition, we introduce a dummy variable that takes the value one if the respondent has no wage income. We expect that it will have a negative effect on contact, because those who have no job tend on average to be more mobile, while we have no prediction as to its effect on cooperation.",

Confirming previous results about nonresponse in cross-sectional surveys and attrition in panel studies this study shows that this notion is largely false. It is true that we have found a significant time cost effect on participation, but the major finding is that nonresponse primarily comes from the left tail of the income distribution. Respondents without work, on welfare, and immigrants are those who both are difficult to contact and to convince to participate. People at the peak of their career are also difficult to contact and to convince. Similar to many other studies we have also found that the probability of contact is relatively low in the big cities and among singles, but we could not find any significant decrease in cooperation.",

In addition to the response ratio the magnitude of the bias depends on the correlation between the propensity to respond and the attributes the survey researcher is measuring. If there is no or only a very weak correlation, there is no or only a small bias even if the survey is burdened by nonresponse. This implies that researchers who in their analysis focus on variables that explain the contact and cooperation probabilities or on measures that are highly correlated with these variables will suffer from a biased inference unless proper compensation measures are taken. Our literature review and our own results are suggestive as to the nature of these variables. It also follows that calibration methods which try to compensate for nonresponse should use variables and population information that explain response. According to our findings gender is not such a variable while, for instance, age, marital status, labor force participation, if immigrant, health status, family income and population density of the area are such variables.<sup><a href=\"#fn12\">12</a></sup>",
