                "text": "In interview surveys collecting information on personal income, the respondents may report income amounts as gross or net of taxes and other deductions. These data must be made homogenous before use for analysis, especially when undertaking comparisons across population groups and countries. The Siena Microsimulation Model (SM2) has been developed as a practical tool providing a robust and convenient procedure for the conversion between net and gross forms of household income. In this paper we describe the logic and structure of the SM2. Starting from data on household and personal income given in different forms, and on the basis of the prevailing tax regime in a country, the SAS routines of the model are designed to estimate full information on income by component, with a breakdown of gross amounts into taxes, social insurance contributions of various types, and net income. Given this specific purpose, SM2 is not meant to be an alternative to general tax-benefit simulation models, but as a complementary tool which those models can usefully exploit. The usefulness of SM2, of course, goes beyond these specific objectives. The distinguishing feature of SM2 is that it can handle diverse tax-benefit regimes using a common logic and a standard set of procedures making it particularly useful for multi-country comparative application; these are explained in the paper in some detail. The immediate context for the development of SM2 has been the requirements of EU-SILC (EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions). Recently SM2 has been implemented for Italy based on EU-SILC data. The application and some results from it are described. Applications have also been developed for France, Spain and Greece. Selected aspects of these applications are illustrated for France and Spain.",

Nevertheless, most microsimulation models are what may be termed as \u2018static\u2019. Such models are used to measure the immediate impact of policy changes concerning the tax-benefit system, without taking into account longer-term changes in the composition, characteristics and behavioural relationships of the population. In such models, changing the rules of eligibility or liability produces outcomes showing the gains or losses from the policy change in a given situation. By contrast, \u2018dynamic\u2019 models are used to compare the effects of alternatives policies in the medium to long term, such as studying the evolution of retirement systems. They aim to analyse the development of the socio-demographic structure of the population. Such models age the original unit records on the basis of probabilities of different real life events (e.g. birth, death, marriage, separation, unemployment, retirement).",

Many static microsimulation models have been developed to simulate taxes, social insurance contributions, benefits and other transfers received to affect the transformation between gross and net forms of income, mediated through complexities of the national fiscal systems. In the EU, important examples are Euromod, already mentioned, and similar national microsimulation models. The primary objective of these models is to provide, on the basis of specific micro-datasets incorporated into the system, a comprehensive facility for simulation of the effect of varying parameters of the tax-benefit system on the income received by various segments of the population. Simulation of taxes and benefits under different regimes (fiscal policy options) forms the output of the system. Such models involving tax-benefit simulation require very detailed and standardised information on household and personal income by component. The logic of such modelling essentially requires household income components in the gross form as <i>inputs</i> which are used to produce corresponding net amounts under the assumed tax-benefit system. In practice, however, generally the required input data are not available in a homogeneous gross form, especially when they come from interview surveys. The required data transformation can of course be done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, but it is more efficient, convenient and comparable to a develop systematic procedures and tools for the purpose.",

The microsimulation involved in SM2 has certain special aspects. On the one hand, it is limited to a fixed tax-benefit regime \u2013 the one that actually exists, under which the available income amounts in different forms have been generated. On the other hand, it does not expect inputs in a homogeneous form but generate income amounts in both gross and net forms as <i>outputs.</i> Furthermore, at the outset, SM2 is designed for <i>multi-country application</i>, as a <i>flexible tool</i> which is <i>portable</i> to the maximum extent possible across (at least the European) countries despite great differences in fiscal systems.

Furthermore, the same information in <i>more than one form</i> is often required to meet different analytical objectives. For instance, for poverty and social exclusion research it is necessary to have information on total household <i>disposable income.</i> Total disposable income means gross income <i>less</i> income tax, regular taxes on wealth, compulsory social insurance contributions, employers\u2019 social insurance contributions, and inter household transfers paid. To study the effect on income distribution, the breakdown of disposable household income separating out old-age and survivors\u2019 benefits and other social transfers is needed. On the other hand, for the study of redistributive effect of taxes, for microsimulation and many other research and policy purposes, information is also required on <i>gross income</i> and its detailed breakdown by component and individual income recipient.",

(i) The relationships or rules vary by income component and according to characteristics and circumstances of the income recipient, in great detail and with many special cases. Some components may be exempt from tax and other deductions, while others may be subject to either or both, fully or in part. (ii) The rules may apply to different types of units \u2013 to individual persons, whole households, or some other intermediate \u2018tax units\u2019 within households. (iii) Different aggregations across income components may be involved in the application of the rules: some components may be treated individually, while others pooled together. (iv) How income is <i>received</i> can vary: it may for instance be received after retentions at source, or received gross to be taxed later. (v) What form it is <i>reported</i> in may vary from one component and recipient to another in the same data set. (vi) Who receives income may vary: while most income is received by individuals, some parts (e.g. certain transfers) may actually pertain to the whole household. (vii) When the income is received or deductions made and the period to they which relate may differ. All this complexity is increased where individuals have a choice among alternative rule-sets to be applied to their particular case.

EU-SILC is a statistical source, developed by European Commission (Eurostat) and implemented by all EU and also many other European countries, for the generation of comparable and detailed information on living conditions and income of households and persons. The central issue to be addressed is that, while the source, type and form of input (collected) information varies across and even within countries, the output required at the European level has to be comparable and standardised (<a href=\"#bib5\">Eurostat, 2002</a>). Furthermore, while the information which can be collected is limited to particular forms because of limitations of the sources providing it, it is required in both net and gross forms for diverse academic and policy research. We see SM2 as a <i>tool</i>, under continuing development, for meeting these objectives in the international, comparative context. Starting from data on household and personal income given in different forms (including some missing data), and on the basis of the prevailing fiscal system in a country, the model estimates full information on income by component, with breakdown of gross amounts into taxes, social insurance contributions, social transfers, and net and disposable income. Therefore it can be applied to diverse data sets to generate variables (such as the EU-SILC Target Variables) in a standard form. Furthermore, it is designed to be <i>flexible</i> to deal with an annual flux of data in different forms across and within countries and also with periodic changes in the national tax systems, which a longitudinal data source such as EU-SILC must deal with.",

These, then, form inputs to the central core of the system designed to generate the required standardised outputs. The system has been developed to maintain a clear distinction between the common and the country-specific parts, and even more importantly, to maximise the part which can be standardised.

The relationships between gross taxable income for a particular component, <i>H<sub>i</sub></i> and quantities like gross income <i>G<sub>i</sub></i> and income after retentions at source <i>XST<sub>i</sub></i> are usually simple, dependent only on <i>i</i>, the income component concerned and determined independently of other components and other persons in the tax unit. The same applies to the relationship between <i>H<sub>i</sub></i> and net <i>N<sub>i</sub></i> for components which are taxed separately at a flat rate or a rate determined by the level of income from that component alone, and of course also for tax exempt components. Sometimes, dependence of the relationship on other sources of income may also be involved, but mostly these are simply in the form of upper limits which may apply to certain quantities pooled over more than one component.",

Using both tax and survey microdata for the microsimulation has the advantage of reciprocal comparison and validation of data.

Such models are widely used as an integral part of the policy-making process in tax and social policy areas, and over the past three decades, microsimulation has moved from the description of the distributional impact of the existing tax and transfer systems to a more complex tool for assessing the different impact of alternatives proposal for changing existing systems. The primary objective of these models is to provide, on the basis of specific micro-datasets incorporated into the system, a comprehensive facility for simulation of the effect of varying parameters of the tax-benefit system on the disposable income received by various segments of the population. Simulation of taxes and benefits under different regimes (fiscal policy options) also forms an output of the system. Such models involving tax-benefit simulation require very detailed and standardised information on household and personal income by component. The logic of such modelling essentially requires household income components in the gross form as <i>inputs</i> which are used to produce corresponding net amounts under the assumed tax-benefit system as <i>outputs.</i> In practice, however, generally the required input data are not available in a homogeneous gross form, especially when they come from interview surveys. The required data transformation can of course be done on an ad hoc basis, but it is more efficient, convenient and comparable to develop systematic procedures and tools for the purpose.",

Of course SM2 itself is a microsimulation model. However, the microsimulation involved in SM2 has certain special aspects, which make SM2 somewhat unique. On the one hand, it is limited to a fixed tax-benefit regime \u2013 the one that actually exists, under which the available income amounts in different forms have been generated. On the other hand, it does not expect inputs in a homogeneous form but generates income amounts in both gross and net forms as outputs.",

The second important clients of the model are Eurostat and the countries participating in EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) project. As noted, the immediate context for the development of SM2 has been certain specific requirements of EU-SILC. The need arises from the fact that, while the source, type and form of input information varies across and even within countries, the output required at the European level has to be comparable and standardised. The information which can be collected is limited to particular forms because of limitations of the sources providing it. For instance in some countries, especially those with income registers, all income components are available in the gross forms; by contrast in many other countries, in particular in southern Europe, generally net received amounts only can be provided by the survey respondents. However, the information is required as a standard set of \u2018target variables\u2019 involving both gross and net forms from all countries participating in EU-SILC. SM2 is specifically designed to meet this requirement. Furthermore, the model has flexibility to deal with an annual flux of data in different forms across and within countries and also with periodic changes in the national tax systems, which a longitudinal data source such as EU-SILC must deal with. Hitherto, SM2 has been implemented for constructing EU-SILC target variables by National Statistical Institutes of Greece and, as described in this paper, Italy; moreover, Portugal (<a href=\"#bib13\">Rodrigues, 2007</a>) and Spain have utilised procedures on the lines of SM2 (in the sense of using aspects of the SM2 logic and structure but developing country-specific software for implementation). Earlier, implementations using ECHP data were developed for Italy, France and Spain. It can be expected that, with the EU countries having to deliver to Eurostat microdata on household income components in the standard gross form (which became mandatory from 2007, EU-SILC wave 4), the need and opportunities for the use of SM2 are likely to expand further. Moreover, EU-SILC data are becoming available to a very wide body of researchers, including those engaged in tax-benefit simulations. Some of those may wish to use SM2 independently to generate more complete series of household income components in net and gross forms.",

Diverse academic and policy research may require income components in both net and gross forms in greater detail. As emphasised in this paper, SM2 is designed at the outset for multi-country application, as a flexible tool which is portable to the maximum extent possible across countries despite great differences in fiscal systems. As noted in <a href=\"#s4\">Section 4</a>, a distinguishing feature of SM2 is that it can handle diverse tax-benefit regimes using a common logic and a standard set of procedures making it particularly useful for multicountry comparative application.<a href=\"#fn6\"><sup>6</sup></a> Reflecting this, the system is designed such that its core consists of a standardised set of routines which can handle a great diversity of input data forms and national tax systems. Country-specific routines are required to specify parameters of the national tax system in an appropriately standardised form; they also standardise the input data format. These, then, form inputs to the central core of the system designed to generate the required standardised outputs. The system has been developed to maintain a clear distinction between the common and the country-specific parts, and even more importantly, to maximise the part which can be standardised. This feature makes the system an appropriate and convenient tool for multi-country application.",

At European level, the increasing need for cross-country comparison has led to the development of Euromod, an integrated multi-country model for the European Union implemented by a consortium of teams in 15 countries (currently being extended to 4 of the New Member States) for policy simulation. Euromod is a static tax-benefit microsimulation model that provides estimates of the distributional effects of national or European level changes in social and fiscal policy. EU-SILC now forms the reference source for Euromod at European level. Before the introduction of this reference, microdata from different sources were used, requiring a lot of efforts for harmonising national sources and for transforming available data into the required model database. One of the main advantage of using EU-SILC is that it potentially provides the microdata for policy simulation for all EU and closely related countries, and does so with increased comparability across countries (<a href=\"#bib8\">Figari <i>et al.</i>, 2007</a>).<a href=\"#fn7\"><sup>7</sup></a> In order to maintain and even enhance this comparability, it is highly desirable that uniform net-to-gross conversion procedures are followed, and if possible to even avoid country-specific development of net-to gross conversion procedures. Clearly, the development and implementation of SM2 for countries where necessary would help in the harmonisation of the conversion procedures, with advantages for national EU-SILC data bases, for tax-benefit modelling such as in the context of Euromod, and for the wider requirements of inter-country comparative research. An added but not-always-obvious practical advantage is that often it would be easier for individual countries to adapt and complete SM2 application than to develop their country-specific net-to-gross conversion procedures ad hoc.",
