To have confidence in the simulated data, it is necessary to validate the model, comparing the output to actual data (<a href=\"#bib8\">Edwards &amp; Tanton, 2012</a>). The validation process for microsimulation modelling has been broadly divided into two components: internal (in-sample, or endogenous) and external (out-of-sample, or exogenous) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Edwards &amp; Tanton, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">O\u2019Donoghue, Morrissey, &amp; Lennon, 2014</a>). Internal validation refers to the process of comparing values from the simulated data set to the original data set. This includes model calibration, whereby the model fit is assessed by comparing the actual and simulated values for constraining (or benchmark) variables. In-sample validation also occurs where actual and simulated outcomes are compared at an aggregate level (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ballas &amp; Clarke, 2001</a>).

The remainder of this paper will not directly discuss techniques for deriving confidence intervals or tests for difference. Techniques to derive confidence intervals, although their potential to aid in model calibration has been well argued, are not appropriate for deterministic models, where iterative runs of the model would not result in different simulated populations. (See Voas and Williamson (<a href=\"#bib26\">Voas &amp; Williamson, 2000</a>) for a discussion of bootstrapping for combinatorial models). Nor will hypothesis-driven tests be included in the comparison which follows, since validation seeks to find agreement, rather than difference, and using tests for difference presume that no observed difference can be interpreted as no difference. A discussion about the hazards of \u2018accepting the null hypothesis\u2019 is elegantly described by Altman and Bland (<a href=\"#bib1\">Altman &amp; Bland, 1995</a>).

Discussions about its use in repeatability studies, the use of confidence intervals, and interpretation are helpfully collated on Martin Bland\u2019s website (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bland, 2011</a>). The method is now well established in medical measurement comparison studies. A systematic review found the method was adopted in 85% of studies validating medical instruments (<a href=\"#bib30\">Zaki <i>et al</i>, 2012</a>). As a result, most standard statistical packages now include options to produce the plot with limits of agreement. In Stata, for example, BA plots can be generated using the \u2018baplot\u2019 command (<a href=\"#bib20\">Seed, 2014</a>). Alternatively, it is possible to generate Bland Altman plots with trend lines rather than limits of agreement (using the \u2018batplot\u2019 command (<a href=\"#bib13\">Mander, 2016</a>)) where the assumption of normally distributed error is not met (and straight limits of agreement could be misleading).

In contrast to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, where the scatterplots indicate near perfect correlation, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> demonstrates the variability of counts within individual wards, as well as the heterogeneity across ward sizes. For all categories plotted, the majority of data points fit along the horizontal 0 line, showing exact agreement for these wards. However, we can also identify which categories are less well fitted: population counts for the oldest age category, for example, Category 7, have been under- or over-simulated by as much as 15 individuals for several wards. (Readers should take note of the y axis scale on each plot.) In addition, we can tell that this discrepancy is prevalent only amongst the smaller wards, with the wider spread data points confined to the left-hand side of the graph. Conversely, the simulated population in the youngest age group is almost perfectly calibrated with census data, with a discrepancy of only 1 extra individual in each of 2 wards. Finally, it can be seen that the total simulated ward counts either match exactly with census numbers or under-represent by 1 individual (this under-estimation likely reflects the flooring function employed by SimObesity in the optimisation algorithm, which prevents partial people \u2018existing\u2019 in the simulated dataset).",

Local fit is typically examined using absolute or relative error or z-scores. If tables are large, it is challenging to identify which are key sources of error. The E5 is helpful in summarizing how many areas could be considered key sources of error, though it is still necessary to locate these. Most other metrics offer a summary measure of category fit (R<sup>2</sup>, SEI, TAE, SAE, RMSE, zm<sup>2</sup>). In other words, these metrics give an overall summary of the accuracy across all of the small areas.

For example, Tanton and Vidyattama (<a href=\"#bib23\">Tanton &amp; Vidyattama, 2010</a>) employ a criterion in validating the GREGWT model: the \u2018TAE criteria\u2019 is met where the TAE for all constraints does not exceed the population of a small area (in their paper, a statistical local error, SLA). This has the advantage of making validity assessment transparent and uniform. However, the authors themselves point out that there is no statistical basis for this criterion, and although based on modelling experience, it represents a somewhat arbitrary cut-off.",

For example, a range of further validation methods have been proposed for probabilistic models (e.g. deriving confidence intervals using multiple iterations (<a href=\"#bib22\">Tanton, 2015</a>)) or regression-based models (this is covered well in a review of regression model validation by Scarborough <i>et al</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Scarborough <i>et al</i>., 2009</a>)).

It seems unlikely that there is a one-size-fits-all quantitative tool to meet all needs. The information that we require of a validation exercise \u2013 the size, direction, source and distribution of the error \u2013 is perhaps too much to ask of a single, summary measure, and it may be misguided to seek one. Comparing models according to a single measure may hide the nuanced differences between models \u2013 where one performs well for low-density areas for instance. The impact of these differences will depend on the purposes of the microsimulation. The choice of validation will remain dependent on the nature of the research (<a href=\"#bib12\">Lovelace <i>et al</i>., 2015</a>), as well as taking into account comparability with previous literature and other models.
