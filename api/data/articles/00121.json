                "text": "The objective of this study was to develop a synthetic database which would be used with a microsimulation model to evaluate alternative health care financing options in Canada. The Social Policy Simulation Database (SPSD), developed by Statistics Canada, was enhanced with population-based data on health status, disability, disease status, health service use and costs from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) and other relevant data sources. The Social Policy Simulation Database and Model (SPSD/M) is a microsimulation tool designed to investigate the financial interactions between governments and individuals in Canada. Typically the SPSD/M has been used to inform policy around income tax, commodity tax, and cash transfer reform. We supplemented the model\u2019s database with health data to enable analysis of alternative health care financing options in Canada. Data on health status, disability, disease status, health service, medication use and out-of-pocket spending on health care were drawn together from population-based surveys (including the CCHS, the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS), Survey of Household Spending (SHS)), health administrative data (the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD)) and estimates of health service use and cost available in the literature. Costs of health services and drugs were assigned to individuals in the CCHS 2009/2010 (host health dataset) through imputation. The resulting health dataset was merged with the SPSD. Models using the enhanced SPSD-Health will allow health policy makers and academics to \u201ctry-out\u201d alternative health care financing options, and consider their monetary impacts on individuals and families in Canada.",

One of the critical issues is how to control total costs. Another issue is how to raise the necessary resources to pay for the full range of health care services, and the implications of different approaches for doing so. In Canada health care is under provincial, not national jurisdiction and the health system is a public contracting model with private delivery, known as Medicare (<a href=\"#bib11\">Deber <i>et al</i>., 2014</a>). A single provincial/territorial government-run insurance plan pays for a specified set of services, with others being covered through a mix of private insurance and out-of-pocket spending. Canada\u2019s current legislative framework mandates full public coverage for medically necessary services delivered in hospitals or by physicians. When care moves from hospitals and physicians to other providers working in the home or the community, coverage may vary by jurisdiction and client group. As one example, prescription drugs are fully covered if delivered to hospital inpatients, but may not be if the patient is treated on an outpatient basis.",

In 2012, approximately half of private sector spending on health care was derived from out-of-pocket expenditures ($29 billion) from private households and 40% from private insurance ($24 billion). Note that, in keeping with Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) standards, health expenditures also include non-consumption (which amounts to about 10% of private spending, and includes but is not limited to hospital non-patient revenue, capital expenditures for privately owned facilities and health research) and does not include non-professional services delivered in home and community care settings (<a href=\"#bib5\">Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2014</a>).",

There are several financing options being considered in Canada. One possibility is to increase the use of private insurance, with or without tax deductibility. Another is to increase the extent to which individuals pay for some or all of the care they receive, again with or without tax deductibility. Another is to increase public coverage. Another is to deem some or all of the value of the health services received to be a taxable benefit. Therefore, a clear understanding of the likely implications of these approaches for both government and individuals is essential.",

                    "text": "While economic theory and reviews of international experiences provide some information regarding the potential impacts of these alternative financing options (<a href=\"#bib32\">Musgrove, 1996</a>), there is currently a lack of empirical evidence regarding the potential effect of these options on the population at the individual level (e.g. with regard to equity, gainers and losers, total expenditures etc.). Furthermore, many models that have attempted to estimate the impact of various financing theories have failed to adequately account for the heavily skewed distribution of health expenditures in the population (<a href=\"#bib11\">Deber <i>et al</i>., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Deber &amp; Lam, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Forget <i>et al</i>., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Roos <i>et al</i>., 2003</a>). One possible reason for the lack of empirical evidence is the fact that data is typically not collected on how individuals interact with the tax and health systems concurrently. These data sources are usually collected independently and used for very different types of analyses. Microsimulation is a technique that can integrate multiple and diverse data to simulate large samples of individuals in order to project economic, socioeconomic, demographic or health developments of a society in the short-term and the long-term. The explicit microanalytic foundation of these models is important in representing realistic population heterogeneities and is suitable for simulating the effects of policy interventions, like alternative health care financing options. In the field of social science, microsimulation modelling began in economics, with simulations of tax and transfer policy, where tax and transfer rules could be applied to an individual or family and the distributional effects examined (<a href=\"#bib43\">Spielauer, 2007a</a>).",

                    "text": "An ideal approach would be to study the long term impacts of alternative health care financing polices, however this was not possible given data constraints. Instead, a static microsimulation tool was created in order to be able to analyze policy changes in a given year. The tool begins with an existing static microsimulation database and model developed at Statistics Canada, the Social Policy Simulation Database and Model (SPSD/M), which simulates the income, expenditures, taxes and cash transfers, of a representative sample of Canadian households (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bordt <i>et al</i>., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hicks &amp; Murphy, 2007</a>). SPSD/M users can add new policy options and can customize the database to suit their policy needs. For this project, the Social Policy Simulation Database (SPSD) was enhanced with population-based cross-sectional data on health status, health service use and costs derived from a range of data sources including the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), health administrative data sources and the Survey of Household Spending (SHS). This resulting database, SPSD-Health, along with custom versions of the SPSM, will allow researchers and policy makers to assess the financial impacts of alternative health care financing options on individuals and families in Canada and will allow them to examine interactions with existing medical expense tax credits. This paper describes the construction of the SPSD-Health database.",

In the CCHS visits to physicians were self-reported in three categories: family physicians, specialist physicians and eye-doctors. Physician costs were calculated by multiplying the annual number of self-reported visits per-individual, to a physician (by type) by the cost per-visit (by type). Because fee schedules are set on a provincial basis, cost per-visit will differ by province; therefore, different costs for each physician category were applied to respondents by province. If respondents had more than one type of physician visit per-year then the costs for all visits were summed to get an annual cost by type of physician.",

Annual numbers of visits to speech language therapists, audiologists, occupational therapists (reported as 1 group), physiotherapists, chiropractors, and psychologists, were self-reported in the CCHS. Costs were calculated by multiplying the number of self-reported visits per-individual to a health professional by the cost per-visit. If respondents had more than one visit to an allied health professional per-year then the costs for each visit were summed to get an annual cost. The list of health professionals above is not exhaustive and visits to other professionals, for instance dentists, social workers and counsellors were also self-reported in the CCHS; however, costs per-visit to these professionals were not available.

If the numbers of visits are under-reported then assigned costs will under-represent true costs. Studies which have looked at the correspondence between self-reported and routinely collected health care utilization data have shown inconsistent results. For example, an Ontario study which investigated agreement between self-reported and routinely collected health care utilization data among seniors found near perfect agreement between contact utilization measures. Seniors tended to over-report their contacts with General Practitioners but under-report their contacts with other medical specialities (<a href=\"#bib37\">Raina <i>et al</i>., 2002</a>). Alternatively, an American study of women with co-occurring disorders concluded that self-reporting provides reliable data on service quantity and is adequate for economic evaluations (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chung <i>et al</i>., 2008</a>). Other characteristics can also affect ones\u2019 ability to accurately report health care system contacts. In general, males aged 75 or older, of lower socio-economic status, and in poorer health have more difficulty accurately recalling health service use (<a href=\"#bib37\">Raina <i>et al</i>., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chung <i>et al</i>., 2008</a>). In addition the CCHS represents community-dwelling Canadians, who are in general healthier than those living in institutions. In the absence of detailed information about health care use in institutionalized populations the information on the CCHS was statistically matched on to institutionalized people in the SPSD. We discuss this limitation of the model in more detail below. Only information about the costs of physician by type were added to the SPSD during statistical matching, information on the number of visits by individuals were not included.",

To ensure that the distribution of costs was adjusted for the main socio-demographic variables (age, sex and income) that would be available to match records with the SPSD, we did separate hot-deck imputations for males and females and then used age group, income category, chronic disease status and disability status as matching variables in the hot-deck imputation between the CCHS 2007 and CCHS 2009/10.",

The survey represents Canadians living in private dwellings with certain exclusions (see <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a> for more details). Cycle 1 took place from March 2007 through February 2009, and collected information from respondents aged 6 to 79 living in private households in 15 locations across Canada. Cycle 2 took place from August 2009 through November 2011, and collected data from respondents aged 3 to 79 living in private households in 18 locations (<a href=\"#bib20\">Giroux <i>et al</i>., 2013</a>). The total sample from Cycle 1 and 2 was 11,999. Information about prescription drug use was collected by asking respondents to produce the medication they were currently taking. Drug identification numbers (DINs) were collected from medication containers during the household interview and verified during the mobile examination centre visit. Current medication use was defined as any medication taken by the respondent on either the day of the household interview or the previous day; up to 15 medications were recorded for each respondent. Each DIN has a World Health Organization (WHO) Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification code assigned by Health Canada (<a href=\"#bib55\">WHO, 2014</a>). The ATC structure divides active substances into groups according to the organ or system on which they act and their therapeutic, pharmacological and chemical properties. The leading prescription medication classes are commonly defined using level-3 ATC codes, which represent major therapeutic or pharmacological subgroups. Information on prescription medication use was obtained from 11,999 CHMS respondents aged 3 to 79. Prescription medication information from the CHMS was found to produce similar patterns of drug use at the population level, compared with other Canadian and American studies (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rotermann <i>et al</i>., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Stagnitti, 2004</a>).",

If CHMS respondent took more than one drug they received more than one cost, which were added up across respondents. If there was no cost available for the drug (which was the case for approximately 30% of drugs reported in the CHMS) then respondents with missing values received an age-specific per-capita cost representing an average annual cost for all prescription medications obtained from the National Health Expenditures Report produced by CIHI for the year 2009 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2014</a>).",

Obtaining complete costing data for every drug reported in the CHMS was extremely challenging and therefore our estimates likely underestimate the total costs of medications used. Although we combined two cycles of the CHMS, the total number of records available for imputation was small (approximately 5,000 individuals taking prescription medications). This discrepancy in sample sizes could lead to less variability than realistic in the imputed values. In addition the CHMS likely represents a healthier sample of the Canadian population, given that respondents must be living in the community to be sampled for the survey and must be able to leave home to attend a clinic visit. As well the CHMS does not represent individuals living in institutions, who are likely heavier users of medications. This survey, although comprehensive, only provides a snapshot of medication use in time therefore we likely underestimated the true cost of medications because cross-sectional data collection underestimates use of medication overall. Another limitation of this approach was using BC as the sole source of the costing information. The BC drug Atlas provides the most comprehensive picture of drug spending of any province in Canada however analysis in 2 consecutive versions of the Canada Drug Atlas found that BC also has some of the lowest costs for drugs across the country (<a href=\"#bib30\">Morgan <i>et al</i>., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Morgan <i>et al</i>., 2008</a>).",

The SPSD-Health, along with customized versions of the SPSM, is one such tool and is unique in Canada in its ability to integrate data related to health and health system costs with detailed income and tax information. By extending an existing social policy database and model (the SPSD/M) we have incorporated the ability to do comprehensive analyses of tax implications at both provincial and the federal levels of government, as well as among individuals, families and households. Other Canadian microsimulation models such as the Population Health Model (POHEM) and Cancer Risk Management Model, both developed at Statistics Canada, are primarily focussed on projecting cases of disease and the impact of health policies in relation to prevention or treatment (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wolfson, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Evan <i>et al</i>., 2013</a>). However, these models do not include detailed health care costs or enough tax data to address the implications of alternative financing options (<a href=\"#bib44\">Spielauer, 2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Decarie, 2011</a>). Internationally, several social policy microsimulation models such as DYNASIM3 and CORSIM, both developed in the US, include selected measures of health status, such as disability, and the need for institutional care but have limited functionality in terms of health care costs and implications of different financing options (<a href=\"#bib44\">Spielauer, 2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Urban Institute, 2015</a>). More recently Parente and colleagues have assessed uptake of private health insurance and Medicaid following the United Stated Supreme Court decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act. These researchers supplemented employer data with information about Medicaid eligibility and costs of health care services to project future increases in insurance coverage (<a href=\"#bib35\">Parente &amp; Feldman, 2013</a>).",

Models using this data should not be used to estimate health services use or total health care costs. In Canada better sources of data exist to accurately estimate health services use and total costs, such as the CCHS series of surveys and CIHI\u2019s health administrative data.",

Furthermore, three significant data issues remain to be discussed. First the institutionalized elderly population, although represented in the SPSD, is not represented in the CCHS 2009/10 PUMF, the linked hospital or drug use data from the CHMS. Essentially health status and health care costs of the community dwelling non-institutionalized population were assigned to the institutionalized population. This limitation may be overcome in the future when better sources of cost information are available nationally that represent the institutionalized population. Second, while children are represented in the SPSD they are not well represented in the health data. The CCHS 2009/10 PUMF represents children only 12 and over, while the CHMS represents only children 3 and over. Although age is an important criteria used in the statistical match, all individuals under age 20 are grouped together in the imputation. Health care costs are very variable in this age group, with children under 1 year old having considerable costs, mainly due to hospitalization for birth (<a href=\"#bib5\">Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2014</a>). Third, individuals that died are not represented in the SPSD, neither is this very important and costly subpopulation specifically represented in the health survey data. Health care costs increase substantially with proximity to death (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tanuseputro <i>et al</i>., 2015</a>), however the SPSD-Health data is not capturing this interesting phenomenon.",

The development of health care cost estimates using a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach based on individual level data versus per-capita or average expenditures is expected to more accurately reflect the skewed distribution of health care costs. Despite best efforts to replicate these distributions at the population level, the resulting health costs data added to the SPSD may reflect reduced variability in health care costs. This may be a result of two factors. First, the lack of representation of sub-populations known to be high users of health care (i.e. the institutionalized population, young children and those who died (discussed above)) in the donor data would result in the exclusion of those high costs estimates. Second, the use of imputation may also reduce the variability in the imputed data compared to the source data, with, for example, extremely high values not fully represented. Hot-deck imputation was the method of choice in this application because it had been used previously, performed well and was easily implemented in SAS (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hennessy <i>et al</i>., 2011</a>). Many other statistical matching techniques, including multiple imputation (<a href=\"#bib38\">R\u00e4ssler, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rubin and Schenker, 1991</a>), are available and would likely perform equivalently compared to the hot-deck. With regard to the hot-deck method, the quality of the imputation is also influenced by the number of donor data points available. In the case of the CHMS and the CCHS 2007 (rapid response component for prescription drug insurance) a small number of donors were available compared to the number of observations in the CCHS 2009/10 PUMF.",

In this case various methods of implementing MSAs can be examined, including MSAs administered by governments and employers. As well, the impact of using MSAs to cover out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs and health services currently covered under Medicare (like physician services) can be interrogated. The MSAs administered by government and employers would be subject to different tax-treatments, resulting in downstream effects on the disposable income of individuals and families.",
