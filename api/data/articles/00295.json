One reason is that an economy is populated by agents with autonomous price setting leverage and with individual agendas that may run counter to the ambitions of policymakers (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eliasson, 1985</a>). This is particularly so when it comes to policies that influence relative prices and production structures, and therefore also the market self-coordination mechanisms of the economy that regulate short- and long-term intergenerational tradeoffs. Hence, boundedly rational Governments must attend not only to the intended outcomes of their policies, but also to unintended, and not controlled for, side effects in the wider economy. In this paper this wider economy is represented by the Swedish Micro \u2013 to \u2013 Macro (MM) model, the market self-coordinating mechanisms of which are sufficiently complex to make all standard macro forecasting and policy models biased predictors of MM model performance.",

We study goal satisfaction and side effects. The objective policy variable targeted is unemployment that Swedish Government attempts to keep at the low Swedish rate through public recruitment based on various forecasts and using different model specifications. One side effect that we study is the consequence on macro-economic growth over the <span class=\"underline\">very</span> long term. We find that the Government generally fails to forecast and to attain its unemployment targets. In the short- and medium-term Keynesian demand policies to raise employment may temporarily raise macro-economic growth and employment. In the process of doing short term good, the Government may however reduce long-term economic growth, because it misunderstands the consequences of short-term feedbacks on, and market reactions of agents, a Stockholm School feature of the model. In the <span class=\"underline\">very</span> long run (beyond 25 years) these consequences tend to cumulate and macro-economic growth is significantly affected. <i>Thus, a seemingly benevolent Government may cause permanent long-term harm by slowly transforming a once wealthy economy into a relatively poor state by consistently, year after year aiming for very short-term targets</i>. Hence the social costs of maintaining an unreasonably low open unemployment, reducing economically motivated reallocations of labor for a long time, will be carried by the next generation. Since these long-term effects depend on the inability of Government \u2013 using inadequate forecasting and policy tools \u2013 to understand long term economy wide market dynamics the conventional policy conclusion changes to: do less. We concludewith a general discussing how to interpret very long-term simulations by quarter for up to or more than 50 years.",

Hence, agents will commit systematic expectational mistakes. For each agent (firm) this means that it becomes rational to learn how to cope with mistakes, rather than to try to learn to improve forecasts. Even if the agent varies its business decisions repeatedly, they will never be right in expectation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eliasson, 1990a</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Eliasson, 1990b</a>). The situation will be the same for the policy maker or government, which faces the additional problem that its actions significantly affect the actions of all agents and thereby the entire economy. When agents are not passive recipients of Government policy, but play games with Government, which then in turn play games with agents, the whole idea of a better informed, or a fully informed central Government with perfect overview, will have to be abandoned. Central Government rather runs the risk of making things worse, trying to beat the market, with large and even permanent negative consequences for the entire economy.

While the macro mapping of the MOSES economy looks Keynesian, behavior at the micro market level is Austrian/Schumpeterian featuring firms that form price expectations and make up production and investment plans to climb ex ante perceived profit hills, the peaks of which they never reach, because the landscape of ex ante profit hills keeps endogenously changing because of all the climbing going on. Firms react on that experience by modifying their anticipations and revising their plans, constantly together changing existing production structures. Hence the economy will never approach a stable and exogenously determinate equilibrium. Agents hence constantly make expectational mistakes that affect their expectations and decisions for the next period. This Stockholm School Economics feature, or the constant making of expectational mistakes of agents, becomes the natural order, as well as a natural transactions costs for economic development. We do not assume a priori, by making the appropriate assumptions, that those transactions\u2019 costs are stochastic. If they are it becomes an \u201cempirical \u201cquestion that can be investigated by simulating the model economy and testing for it. Economy wide market self-coordination of boundedly rational agents thus determines the equilibrating properties of the model economy. Since no exogenous and analytically determinate equilibrium exists it becomes inappropriate to talk about \u201cout of equilibrium behavior\u201d of the economy. Market circumstances furthermore determine how far from the exogenous upper technology limits the economy will operate (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eliasson, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Eliasson, 1991a</a>).",

Since these market confrontations are managed individually by firms and only involve partial consistency checks, the final market clearing each quarter means (for almost all firms) that inconsistencies must be cleared by price and inventory adjustments, the absorption of unexpected losses, or the registering of surprise profits.

For the simulation experiments of this study this treatment of the public sector becomes important because it becomes, as has been the case in Sweden for long, the main cyclical regulator of employment. As is conventional in national accounting, the public employment in these experiments is proportional to the value-added component of the public sector. The public sector, however, draws resources produced in other sectors as well as imports and must be financed. Regulating employment through public sector expansion therefore has consequences throughout the markets of the entire economy. Also, the implicit assumption is that the decision to tax and to increase public spending, and therefore also public employment, is something households and individuals have voted for politically and not with their private money through the consumption expenditure system.

Analyses of that kind have also been run, and the lessons learned so far are that <i>policy control of the MOSES model economy</i> is quite restricted. Even knowing its complete specification does not help improve central policy control of the model economy. It often becomes frustratingly impossible to achieve ambitious policy targets because the MOSES economy is (1) extremely complex, but still much less complex than a real economy, and (2) that it is populated by agents with own independent agendas and individual market leverage to pursue them (<a href=\"#bib16\">Eliasson, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Eliasson, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Eliasson, 1990a</a>). Policy makers therefore commit errors, and often massive blunders when pushing their ambitions too far. In an Experimentally Organized Economy (EOE) no policy maker can be confident that it can win a market game against all agents in the market. The application of this essay is however much simpler. The Government now has no MOSES model to consult, and even though it could hire the two of us to generate thousands of experiments it would never be capable of learning the specification or code of the MOSES model economy from only studying the data the model generates.

The public deficit explodes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), as does the trade deficit, and the domestic interest shoots up. Obviously, this is not a sustainable policy scenario. If the government had not been intending to transfer all production to the public sector it would have called off the policy experiment at the latest after some ten years in order not to cause large cumulating welfare losses for later generations. The problem is that using its crude macroeconomic models and watching aggregate data, signals of an impending collapse do not show clearly until after some 15 years. So careless policy makers and inept economists/advisers may cause long-term disaster in the MOSES model economy.",

Workers will increasingly (because of policies) go to the shrinking share of very productive manufacturing firms capable of paying more,<a href=\"#fn7\"><sup>7</sup></a> or to Government. Low productivity firms are forced to contract production or to exit. Average productivity in manufacturing temporarily increases because of an <i>improved static allocation of workers</i>.

Manufacturing output and productivity developed as in the EQBASE scenario, and a slight loss in GDP during the first period was concentrated to the other sectors. A slower demand for workers lowered wage increases, and increased competitiveness of exports, but pushed up the unemployment rate. Over the 30-year period the public deficit practically vanished. Interestingly, it appears as if a sustainable and acceptable policy alternative would fall somewhere between ZEROBASE and EQBASE, a slowly expanding and small public sector, a steady expansion of the economy and a sustainable unemployment rate around 4.5 percent, which is more or less what is achieved in the calibrated BASE case.",

So, the levels generated in the simulations are reasonably accurate. We know that pursuing the more ambitious unemployment targets in SIMP1, SIMP2 and RAT2 lead to unacceptable long run economy wide outcomes. We also know that the unemployment rate as defined includes a transactions component of normal labor turnover associated with the normal structural change that always accompanies economic growth. It is difficult to tell how large that normal component is, but it should be placed significantly above the 1 and 2 percent levels targeted in the SIMP1 and SIMP2 experiments. The sustainable 4 to 5 percent in the EQBASE and BASE scenarios place is still below the long run US case, which many would regard as normal for a functioning labor market. So raising public recruiting and sector growth very little above the EQBASE to the BASE case a modest increase in real wages is achieved with no inflationary consequences (CPI change is hardly affected), while manufacturing output growth does not change much, and GNP increases because of faster public sector growth. Instead of almost disappearing, as in the ZEROBASE, the public deficit stays large in the BASE case, even though not disastrously large as in the extreme policy cases. So even a US level of unemployment comes with a maintained deficit on public account, and while the ratio of public debt to GNP may not increase, in the longer run (beyond our simulation period) further ambitions to hold down unemployment will tilt the scenario in the direction of the non-sustainable macro balances of the SIMP 1 and SIMP 2 policy experiments.",

In early 1993 (dated February 8) one of us (Gunnar Eliasson) received a letter of positive criticism of the original working paper from Professor Odd Gulbrandsen, an old IUI associate, with experience from large scale modelbuilding at IIASA, and just retired head of the research division of UNCTAD, who had read the paper carefully. Professor Gulbrandsen brought up the principal problem of extreme \u201cpredictions\u201d associated with the longer term dynamic simulations of complex models that were always partial however well founded. Since the original working paper of this study is of interest in itself because it became a direct input in the IUI Long Term survey (<a href=\"#bib3\">Andersson et al., 1993</a>), and there came out in the form of strong recommendations to reduce ambitious unemployment policies and make sure that workers were transferred to growing firms from crisis industries, even at the cost of a higher transactions unemployment. Gulbrandsen\u2019s critique therefore also relates to the way our simulation results were used, even though the <a href=\"#bib3\">Andersson et al. (1993)</a> study had not been published when he wrote his letter. It rather points to the general methodological problem of the empirical relevance associated with large scale initial state dependent and difficult to estimate microsimulation models like MOSES. We therefore chose to complement the revised document with this methodological postscript, and in particular comment on <i>the relevance of extreme model predictions of the outcomes of extreme policies</i>.",

Sometimes, therefore variables not targeted for calibration exhibited unexpected data constellations, sometimes fine details that we could explain in terms of their generation in the model, but that were far from what you would expect in reality. Firms, even flagships of Swedish manufacturing industry could go bankrupt and exit. Since we had no ambition to predict correctly at that level of fine detail it was not documented, in this case for confidentiality reason.

Even though Swedish policy making had been extreme during the 1990s it was never that extreme, and the policy ambitions of SIMP1 would most probably have been abandoned long before the end of the simulation.

Some odd constellations of predictive output that even the modelers would not discover before printing the table are likely. And when discovered and technically explained they may be found to be of methodological interest, or perhaps even a relevant possibility to consider. Above all, they are properties of the model economy that we study. So of course, we should document all data and wait for observant criticism, and then decide whether we are arguing about a real economic phenomenon, or an abstract theoretical possibility.
