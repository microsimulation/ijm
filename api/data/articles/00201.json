By exploring alternative scenarios to our baseline forecasts and their implications for GDP growth, we find that the gap between male and female participation is mostly explained by (i) differences in the individual conditional behaviour of older female cohorts, (ii) inadequate family policies. In particular, our results show that the conditional behaviour of younger women in the low-participation countries is similar to that in Sweden. In a nutshell, what is needed is not a change of behaviour on the side of women but a change of mentality on the side of institutions and firms.",

The employment gap is highest in Italy and Greece (19.4 and 18.3 ppt respectively) and lowest in Sweden (4.6 ppt), Lithuania (2.5 ppt) and Finland (1.9 ppt). Fostering the higher participation of women is crucial to meet the Europe 2020 target of achieving an overall employment rate of at least 75% by 2020; this in turn would be crucial to reduce the risk of social exclusion and poverty for women and to achieve inclusive growth (<a href=\"#bib17\">European Comission, 2013</a>). In this framework, <a href=\"#bib12\">Richardson et al. (2018)</a> present medium- and long-term projections of female participation and employment rates for a selected number of EU Member States (Sweden, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Hungary and Greece) and suggest that by 2020 none of these countries except Sweden will have reached the employment rate target (though Ireland will be close). In the present paper, we analyse the role played by some key drivers (demography, education, participation behaviour) and by some policy actions in shaping future female labour market participation in the same selection of countries, in order to obtain indications on which are the factors having the highest bearing in the unsatisfactory projected evolution of participation in those countries. To be more specific, we explore the implications of different scenarios for the parameters of the microsimulation model introduced in <a href=\"#bib12\">Richardson et al. (2018)</a>, and contrast these scenarios with the baseline projections for the selected EU Member States that were also presented in that paper.",

The model on which we base our exercise is a reduced form one, estimated exploiting both within country variation and cross-sectional variation<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup>. However, although these are reduced form equations, the inclusion of lagged values of individuals\u2019 participation (as discussed in Section 2 below) can control for a large part of unobserved individuals\u2019 heterogeneity as well as for persistence in individual\u2019s behaviour. This will make the estimated parameters closer to structural ones and produce a reasonably reliable descriptive exercise about policy changes. Then the projections are made under the implicit assumption that the underlying structural relationships between variables on which the model is built will remain stable over the simulation period. They could indeed change either endogenously, because of feedback mechanisms that operate at scales not observed in the data, and therefore not considered in the model, or for exogenous reasons, because of the arrival of unexpected shocks (as a surge in migration flows) that modify both the characteristics and the behaviours of the population. Therefore, we stress that our projections should be considered as <i>benchmarks</i>, rather than forecasts: these benchmarks are useful insofar they point to the implicit consequences of the dynamics that are currently under way in the society, and that could trigger or require at some point in the future the activation of corrective mechanisms. Such benchmarks allow us to investigate, <i>par diff\u00e9rence</i>, the effects of specific scenario or policy parameters, and the determinants of the results. This is what we do when we contrast the results obtained in the baseline scenario with those obtained under alternative scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, there is no straightforward way of improving on this. A structural labour supply model based on a tax-benefit model (EUROMOD) may be a challenging way to improve on it, and it is high on our agenda for the future. However, we reckon the present exercise interesting and informative in a descriptive \u2013 not normative \u2013 way, as it is a way of showing which determinants have the highest bearing on the dynamics of the long run trends in female participation and occupation rates.",

In each period, agents first go through the Demographic module, which deals with evolving the population structure by age, gender and area, based on Eurostat official demographic projections. Then, individuals above an individual-specific age threshold retire. Retired individuals remain in the simulation until they die but nothing else happens to them, except the ageing process. Students enter the Education module. If they remain in education, nothing else happens to them until the next period. If they exit education, they join the ranks of potentially active individuals. Females enter the Household composition module, where it is determined whether they form or remain in a union and whether they give birth to a child.

The <i>Swedish participation</i> scenario assumes that in all countries, all covariates have the same effect as in Sweden, with respect to participation. Hence, differences in outcomes must be attributed to composition effects only.

Second, the aggregate unemployment rate that enters the employment equation is measured in the estimation data and also reflects the effects of the crisis. In the simulations, the estimated coefficient of the flag is kept constant, but the flag itself, signalling the presence of the crisis, is allowed to \u201cshrink\u201d towards zero. In the baseline scenario, the value of this flag decreases linearly from one to zero, and reaches zero in 2020 (2030 in Greece).

In the participation equation, the only other individual characteristics considered are household composition, and participation and employment history (<a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>). However, the share of women in the 20\u201344 years old age range that are living in a union is higher in Sweden than in all other countries under analysis, so differences in household composition, if anything, play a role in attenuating the participation gap, rather than in explaining it. Part of the answer has to be found in the path persistent dynamics of participation itself: in Sweden it is easier to find employment; women are encouraged to participate in the labour market, even if only marginally, from an early age, and re-entry after maternity leave is facilitated. This has dynamic consequences as attachment to the labour market increases even at later ages.",

Moreover, the behaviour of younger women is not detrimental to participation, their lower educational attainments are only partly responsible for the participation gap, and demography doesn\u2019t help either in explaining it. The last source of the participation gap for women in childbearing years \u2013 in the model \u2013 is the role of family-friendly policies, and in particular the presence of public, affordable childcare, maternity leave, and part-time opportunities. As it turns out, inadequate family policies and part-time opportunities are important determinants of the low participation rates of younger women, thus completing our picture of the causes of the female participation gap: in short (and with some inevitable simplification) it is the adverse behaviour of older women, and insufficient policies and lack of opportunities for younger women.",

According to our model, education plays a limited role, as older women with high education also participate little, and younger women in childbearing years are constrained by factors other than their level of education. An increase in the minimum retirement age is effective in keeping more women close to retirement in the labour force: however, due to the small number of women affected, the aggregate effects are small. Finally, a prolonged state of labour market distress due to the consequences of the Great Recession would push countries further away from the Europe 2020 targets, though again a lack of aggregate demand is not a primary explanation for the low observed female participation rates, and their incomplete projected convergence to the Swedish benchmark.",

Interestingly, this result turns out to be driven by older cohorts, i.e. people aged 45 years or more in the initial population. The conditional behaviour of younger women is not too different from their counterparts in Sweden, and if anything it is even more favourable to participation. Putting it differently, this indicates that there is not much room for manoeuvre to increase participation through higher education, and little can be done about the effect of choices made far in the past by older cohorts of women regarding their participation in the labour market.",

Whilst population ageing might well create important labour supply shortages in the future, differences in the demographic trends cannot explain the incomplete and inadequate expected convergence to Swedish participation rates. Indeed, as many low-participation countries in the past few decades have experienced a stronger demographic transition than Sweden, with dramatic shrinkage of their younger cohorts, demographic evolution will contribute positively to convergence, as the relatively larger older cohorts, characterised by low participation rates, will gradually exit working age.",

Education matters a lot in explaining <i>current participation levels</i> of the older cohorts, as older women with low education often never considered entering the labour force, and is still significant in explaining current participation levels of younger generations because of the lower returns women with low education can expect from their participation in the labour market, both in terms of a lower probability of finding a job and lower wages. At the same time, education is less relevant for explaining <i>future participation changes</i> because (i) younger women in low-participation countries have already closed most of their education gap, with respect to benchmark countries like Sweden, and (ii) the premium that education commands with respect to unemployment and pay for younger women has also shrunk, partly due to increasing work insecurity and labour market dualisation, with young women getting a disproportionate share of \u2018bad\u2019 jobs, irrespective of their education level (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berton et al., 2012</a>).",

Moreover, such policies require cooperation on the side of firms, which should accommodate (costly) part timers and on-leave mothers without penalizing their career. Incentives and support from the Governments are clearly needed to achieve this goal. For instance, most Swedish companies are flexible regarding parental duties, and employees still get 80 per cent of their pay when they have to stay home with sick children or dependents. Yet, this does not happen at the expense of productivity: Sweden ranks ninth in the Global Competitiveness Index 2015\u20132016 (Ireland is 24th Spain 33rd, Italy 43rd, Hungary 63rd and Greece 81st; see <a href=\"#bib18\">Schwab, 2015</a>).",

                    "text": "Our reference country, Sweden, is also a leading example for parental leave policies. In Sweden, parents are entitled to 480 days of paid parental leave when a child is born or adopted. For 390 days, parents are entitled to nearly 80\u00a0per cent of their normal pay, up to a ceiling; the remaining 90 days are paid at a flat rate; those who are not in employment are also entitled to paid parental leave. The measure is financed to a large extent by employers\u2019 contributions and for the remaining part (about a quarter) by general taxation. Parental leave can be taken up until a child turns eight years old. The leave entitlement applies to each child (except in the case of multiple births), so parents can accumulate leave from several children. In this period, parents also have the legal right to reduce their normal working hours by up to 25%. The duration of parental leave in Sweden is very high by international standards and is perhaps Sweden\u2019s most famous argument when it comes to being a child-friendly system. Generous parental leave is not sufficient by itself though, to ensure a family-work balance. Hungary provides even longer periods of parental leave: 156 weeks for either parent, with cash benefits totalling 70% of previous earnings, up to a ceiling, for insured parents in the first 104 weeks, and flat rate benefits for non-insured parents or for insured parents in the last 52 weeks (<a href=\"#bib1\">Addati et al., 2014</a>). However, participation rates in Hungary are among the lowest in Europe, and are projected to grow only at a comparatively slow rate. The reason is that parental leave can backfire when gender equality is not firmly rooted in the workplace, as women might lose their attachment to the labour force, or end up being discriminated against. It is difficult to separate the directions of the causal link between attitudes and behaviours, a positive attitude towards female participation being both a prerequisite and a consequence of increased female participation. However, policies aimed at promoting gender equality favour both. In Sweden, for instance, each parent has two months of paid parental leave reserved exclusively for him or her. Should a father \u2013 or a mother for that matter \u2013 decide not to take them, they cannot be transferred to the partner. 85% of Swedish fathers take parental leave, and men in Sweden take nearly a quarter of all parental leave. Those who don\u2019t take the leave face questions from family, friends and colleagues. And in an effort to further improve these figures, the government provides a gender equality bonus, consisting of an extra daily payment if 270 days of the paid parental leave are divided evenly between the mother and the father.",

In our reference country, Sweden, public childcare is guaranteed to all parents and it operates on a whole-day basis: most childcare facilities are open from 6.30 a.m. until 6.30 p.m. Pre-school is free for children aged between three and six years old for up to 15 hours per week. Aside from paid leave, the government provides an additional monthly child allowance until a child reaches the age of 16 years old, which covers the cost of additional childcare in pre-school years. Education for children aged six years old to university level is free of charge. The list of family friendly policies could proceed further. In 2010, for instance, the Swedish government introduced a new rule into its social insurance scheme to help single parents who fall ill and cannot look after their child. The rule allows another insured person (i.e. a person legally living and/or working in Sweden) who forgoes paid work to receive temporary parental benefits to look after the child. Low income parents may be entitled to a housing allowance. Parents pushing infants and toddlers in prams and pushchairs can ride for free on public buses. All in all, the government is an active player in structuring the whole society around the needs of young families.",
