Successful to the extent that static microsimulation models have become a standard tool for policy evaluation in most Western governments, but at the same time less accepted among academic economists, who sometimes find unacceptable the compromises between theoretical and methodological rigor and what is feasible given insufficient data and resources. They have not seen a microsimulation model as a useful tool in developing and testing theory.",

(1980)</a>, <a href=\"#bib76\">Orcutt et al. (1986)</a> and <a href=\"#bib43\">Harding (1996)</a>. Many microsimulation models are static without behavioral relations, and this is in particular true for models run by government agencies, international organizations and consulting firms. Behavioral modeling is still to a large extent an academic exercise. <a href=\"#table1\">Tables 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#table3\">3</a> list models which at least include some behavioral relation. These tables have been put together using primary as well as secondary sources, for instance the survey articles mentioned above, which implies that a few models could well have become misclassified. What defines a behavioral relation is not crystal clear. A matrix of transition probabilities differentiated by age and sex is a simple behavioral relation in the sense that behavior is differentiated by age and sex. Some models include relations derived from economic theory but this is not a requirement for a model to become classified as behavioral. For instance, demographic models of transition matrix type have been included. Although these models include behavioral heterogeneity in a broad sense many of them do not capture any behavioral response to policy changes. Their behavioral relations do not include the relevant policy parameters.",

Most of these models are large and cover the whole household sector in a country and include modules which age their populations as well as modules which are more central to the general purpose of the models, for instance, labor supply relations which capture behavioral adjustments in the labor market to tax changes. The behavioral relations of all models, however, are not specified such that behavior directly depends on the policy instruments, some are more of a demographic type. Also, in dynamic modeling the Americans were pioneers. In Europe German scientists would seem to have worked relatively early with dynamic microsimulation models.",

If X<sub>2</sub> can be related to X<sub>1</sub> by way of a behavioral model then the model can be estimated from the second, external data set and used in the micro simulation model to simulate X<sub>2</sub>. Such a relation need not be based on theory about behavior, what is needed is a good predictive relation, but if it is delivered from good theory, one would probably have more confidence in its predictive ability.",

This is usually done by introducing mortality tables, relations for the birth of new individuals, marriages, separations etc. Similarly, behavioral relations could update other characteristics of the population like the labor force participation, unemployment, hours of work, wage rates, housing, childcare etc. As long as the purpose is limited to updating, behavioral relations are only needed to the extent that they yield more stable and precise predictive relations compared to alternative ways of updating the population. In practice many models use matrices of transition probabilities estimated separately for a few subgroups of the population, for instance, by age and sex, but with no strong connection to theory.",

A necessary requirement of a behavioral model to satisfy this purpose is that the policy parameters directly or indirectly enter the model. This is normally not the case in the simple transition matrixes used for aging and updating. For instance, in a study of the distributional effects of income tax changes the labor supply function should be such that labor supply depends on the tax rates (and virtual income). A second requirement is that the behavioral relation is stable such that its parameters do not change as a result of policy changes. This is an issue much discussed, for instance, in relation to the recent major tax reforms in many countries. Can labor supply relations estimated on data collected before the reforms be used to predict or evaluate the effects of the reforms? Are the parameter estimates stable in spite of the large tax changes in some countries? The same kind of concern could be raised when microsimulation models are used to simulate processes of long duration, for instance changes in pension systems. Is it possible to extrapolate long into the future earnings and labor supply relations estimated from short time spans of data?",

In the first two cases one estimates (average) probabilities conditional on certain individual characteristics and the deviation from the most probable outcome is accomplished by chance, by throwing a \u201dloaded dice\u201d. In the third case we simulate deviations from the average by adding random disturbances to the \u201dsystematic\u201d part of the model. In random assignment schemes like statistical matching, the model structure is implied and never estimated. It is only defined by the variables which define \u201dcloseness\u201d. The idea is to find a donor of data among the observations in the population which in some sense is similar or close to the receiving unit. Suppose for instance, that the original data set includes observations on income for two consecutive years for each individual. A simulated income distribution for a third year could be obtained by defining closeness between the donor\u2019s income in the first year and the receiver\u2019s income in the second year perhaps also between other variables like age and sex and then randomly select a donor among those who have the (approximately) same age, sex and income as the receiver. The donor\u2019s income for the second year is then used as a prediction of the receiver\u2019s income in year three. The implicit model assumption is of course that income transitions remain unchanged. With a similar but somewhat more elaborate approach <a href=\"#bib46\">Hussenius and Sel\u00e9n (1994)</a> linked short panels of income data to life-cycle income paths to analyze how like-cycle incomes were influenced by tax and transfer changes. In the MICROHUS model (<a href=\"#bib57\">Klevmarken et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Klevmarken and Olovsson, 1996</a>) the technique was used to simulate the properties of the house a family was predicted to buy (size, tax assessed value, size of mortgage and interest paid).",

A disadvantage though is that the statistical properties of the resulting \u201dpredictions\u201d are incompletely known. Results from the imputation literature might be relevant. Another practical disadvantage is that the random assignment technique can never predict beyond the range of values already present in the original sample.",

There is thus a need to use more than one time unit within a micro simulation model. This could be accomplished in several ways. One approach is to run simulation loops within a year for those sub models which operate on a shorter time unit, another approach is to use count models which simulate the number of days, weeks or months a person is sick, unemployed, etc in a year. A third approach is to use a continuous time model, for instance an event history model, to simulate the date when a person enters and leaves a certain state.

It is hard to know if this is the result of the nonexistence of stable micro relations, that the behavior of economic agents changes as the result of new policies, new institutions and other external changes, or of insufficient data and inadequate research approaches in economics (for a discussion see <a href=\"#bib56\">Klevmarken, 1994</a>), or that the research process simply has to take more time.

In each module of a large microsimulation model modeling meets with the same difficulties as in more conventional economic modeling, but in addition it has the difficulty of making the different modules fit together. There are obvious problems when modules have to be tested and estimated on different data sets, but there is also a requirement of an internal consistency of the model structure. For instance, if one module needs a particular explanatory variable, then another module is needed to simulate it such that the simulated values can be fed into the first module. To handle these problems the model builder needs a strategy as to the general model structure, as discussed above. A piecewise approach in which one starts with one module and then takes decisions about subsequent modules depending on the outcome of the research for the first is likely to lead to inconsistencies and to force the model builder to painful compromises for practical purposes.",

Depending on the purpose it would seem essential to have at least the key policy and effect variables included in the same data set. Assumptions of independence or conditional independence should be limited to relations which are of second order importance to the uses of the microsimulation model. If the dynamics of behavioral adjustments is important, which is almost always the case in policy simulations and evaluations, then panel data are needed. The large household panel data sets collected in several countries are thus essential for the construction of general microsimulation models of the household sector.",

Such an approach would make feasible an analysis of the same policy carried out in each country separately, but it would not permit the analysis of any interacting effects across boarders. If, for instance tax policies and social policies in one country are likely to attract or detract workers from another country, then a data collection design is needed which permits the survey people to follow respondents from one country to another to make feasible an analysis of the region wide policy effects mediated by migration.",

Because simulated data can be aggregated, the data used to \u201dcalibrate\u201d against could either be micro data or aggregate data, for instance from the national accounts.
