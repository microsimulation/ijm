This model was also to act as an \u2018umbrella\u2019 under which results obtained from analysis of the HUS-project database could be successively collected (<a href=\"#bib8\">Klevmarken and Olovsson, 1993</a>). These data, a random sample of Swedish households, provide the sample of individuals and households on which the simulation model operates. They have also, with few exceptions, been the empirical base for the estimation of behavioral relations. The attempt to build a microsimulation model which includes the tax and transfer systems, as well as behavioral relations, is a never-ending one, as there are always improvements that can be made. In order to get something which can run before all research funds have been used up, it has occasionally been necessary to sacrifice the ambition of front-line research for less sophisticated and quicker solutions. In this sense the model, now christened to MICROHUS, should be considered work in progress!",

The latter type of model typically includes all or almost all details of the tax and transfer rules and, depending only on the accuracy of the data used and coding detail, it can reproduce the distribution of income with almost no error. In contrast, any attempt to model behavioral factors will necessarily imply sizeable specification errors and, as a result, it might not be necessary to include the tax and transfer system with the same degree of detail as in the accounting models. The key goal of this study was to get some indication of the <i>relative size</i> of the behavioral adjustment effects. If they are small, then accounting models will suffice. But if the adjustment effects are not negligible, more effort has to go into modelling behavior.",

For instance, in a microsimulation study one might analyze the impact of an income tax change on the distribution of income - who loses and who gains. The microsimulation approach is thus primarily designed for studies of the distributional effects of economic policy, and one of its main advantages is that it permits assumptions of heterogeneous behavior. Every individual, household or firm does not necessarily behave as the average economic agent. When economic relations are highly nonlinear, when tax laws and rules of transfer programs introduce censoring and truncation, and when subpopulations differ in behavior, models of average behavior inadequately evaluate the impact of policy changes. In such cases, a microsimulation model can do better. A good example is one of the first microsimulation models actually used for policy evaluation, namely the model of the Swedish supplementary pension scheme (<a href=\"#bib2\">Eriksen, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Klevmarken, 1973</a>).",

In these models it is only necessary to simulate the behavior of each subgroup. Population totals and means are then obtained by weighting each group by its relative size. An alternative, and usually more general and flexible, approach is to simulate each individual, household or firm. In this case, the simulation model usually operates on a real sample of individual units. Gradually, through the simulation process, the sample values of each unit are updated. An advantage of this approach is that the analysis is not limited to certain preselected subgroups of units. Rather, the analyst can choose any mode of analysis of the updated sample. If this sample was a probability sample from some population, for example, the sampling weights could, in principle, be applied to the updated sample to infer to the population.",

The more schooling a woman has, the higher the probability she will enter a consensual union and marry. Work experience also increases the probability of forming a union.

The probability of having a child also depends on these variables and on the woman\u2019s wage rate and the disposable income of the household. Females with relatively long schooling postpone their first child but tend to have their next child (children) quite soon thereafter. Females with just a few years of work experience have a smaller probability of having a child than women with both less and more experience.

In MICROHUS every individual is assumed to decide about his/her future education at the age of 15. <i>A</i> model for the total length of theoretical education and vocational training was estimated from HUS-data. Due to the major changes in the educational system in post-war Sweden, this model was estimated for three groups of birth cohorts (those born between 1935 and 1944; 1945 and 1954 and from 1955 on) and also by gender. In simulating the behavior of future cohorts, the estimates for the youngest cohorts are used. The length of schooling depends on the father\u2019s and the mother\u2019s schooling, the father\u2019s occupation and whether the simulated individual grew up in a big city, abroad or somewhere else. <i>A</i> general result is that the parents\u2019 background is of less importance for the young cohorts than it is for the older cohorts.

The absence of economic incentives to join the labor force is a weakness of the model which will be removed in future model revisions.

Most previous estimates for Sweden are limited to males aged 25-55 years. There is a range of results depending on data set, model and estimation method (see the surveys in <a href=\"#bib3\">Gustafsson and Klevmarken (1993)</a> and <a href=\"#bib1\">Aronsson et al., 1994</a>). Most uncompensated and compensated elasticities are close to 0.1 and the corresponding income elasticities are very small. The few estimates of compensated wage rate elasticities available for females are higher than those for men, ranging from 0.3 to 1.3. The income elasticities are also relatively small for females. Compared to these results, our estimated compensated elasticity for males of 0.131 is of the same magnitude, while the estimate for females of 0.112 is much smaller. Our estimates also differ from previous results as to the relative importance of the income and substitution effects. For couples, the income and substitution effects are almost of the same magnitude and the result is that any change in marginal tax rates will have almost no effect on the labor supply of couples. Singles, however, are more responsive to tax changes. Both the income and the substitution effects are relatively large, but the latter dominates the former - and a decrease in marginal tax rates will thus result in an increased labor supply.",

Above a certain threshold, high income earners had to pay an additional 20 per cent state tax. In principle, the new tax system had only two tax brackets, one with a tax of about 30 per cent and one with 50 per cent. In practice as a result of a political compromise, a few additional tax brackets with a marginal income tax rate higher than 30 per cent were introduced for low incomes.

One might also note that many households included a full-time working, and sometimes well paid, male and a part-time working, and less well paid, woman - which would tend to even out the tax effects within the household.

The official estimates show a weakly increasing rate of participation in the labor force for males until 1990 and then a declining rate.

Given the difficulty in comparing weekly hours with the annual hours simulated by MICROHUS, the slightly increasing trend for males is a little underestimated by MICROHuS, while the more strongly increasing trend for females is reproduced even less well. A closer look at the distribution of annual work hours for females as simulated by MICROHUS reveals that the dispersion of hours increases. Women who work part-time decrease their hours, while those who work full-time or almost full-time increase their hours. This increase in dispersion is particularly strong in 1991-1992 and might be the result of the tax reform. There is no similar increase in dispersion for males.",

The resulting disposable income per equivalent adult is assigned to each household member. The unit of observation used when computing measures of central tendency and inequality is thus the individual household member. The simulated average real income fluctuates around a more or less constant level until 1991, when it increases. This increase is smaller for households with children than for the entire population. The relative income of households with children decreases from about 90 per cent of average income at the beginning of the period to just above 80 per cent at the end. The tax reform might thus have favored households without children, although the reform package included an increase in the child allowances to balance the tax changes.",

The direct effects of the tax reform are an increase in the average level of disposable income and increased income inequality. For instance, applying the 1992 tax and transfer system to the 1989 incomes and taking the difference in price levels into account results in a median real income and a Gini coefficient which are respectively 15 and 12 per cent higher than is the case when the 1989 tax and transfer system is used (<a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a>). The increase in inequality is even higher (22 to 32 per cent) among households with children than it is for the whole population. These estimates are higher than those obtained before the tax reform was implemented. A partial explanation is that MICROHUS does not include the benefits which were not liable for taxation before the tax reform but became taxable after the reform.

If behavioral adjustments other than in hours of market work are permitted in 1991, the income level decreases by three per cent (Simulation 2). If a full adjustment is allowed, it decreases by four per cent (Simulation 1). Parallel to this decrease in income level there is an increase in income inequality. When everything else but hours of market work can deviate from their 1989 levels, the Gini coefficient in 1991 increases by seven per cent (Simulation 2). However, when market hours are also allowed to adjust to the new tax system, there is only a five per cent increase in inequality (Simulation 1). A general conclusion is that the behavioral adjustments cause income levels to decrease and inequality to increase. For households with children, the decrease in level is marginally stronger - and the increase in inequality marginally weaker - than for the entire population. The behavioral adjustment effects on inequality for all households amount to about one-third of the direct effects while, for households with children, they are smaller.",

Panel C shows that (nominal) wages increased for both genders, in particular in 1991 and 1992. Wage dispersion also increased (more for women than for men). The increased inequality in income due to behavioral changes can thus, at least partly, be traced to increased wage dispersion, increased dispersion in work hours among women and, to some extent, to increased unemployment and retirement.

The model might have inherent dynamics which could have produced increased inequality independently of the tax reform. This is likely in particular for the sub-model which updates wages. A fourth approach to assess the effects of the income tax reform is to compare the income distributions which would have resulted if the 1989 income tax system had also applied in 1990-1992 (Simulation 4). Thus while the earlier simulations examined the impact of the 1991 tax-transfer system upon either the 1989 or the early 1990s worlds, this simulation tests the impact of the 1989 system upon the early 1990s world. <a href=\"#table6\">Table 6</a> shows what changes in work hours, wage rates and income that the model would produce if the 1989 tax system had also applied in 1990-92. Panel B indicates that the inequality of <i>wage rates among</i> males, as measured by the coefficient of variation, increases by 15 per cent from 1989 to 1991 and by 16 per cent from 1989 to 1992. These increases <i>exactly equal</i> the increase shown in <a href=\"#table5\">Table 5</a>, Panel C.Thus, the conclusion is that the increase in wage rate inequality for males cannot be the result of the tax reform. The same conclusion also holds for women. The rise in wage rate inequality during the early 1990s is thus due to labor market and other changes, rather than to the tax reforms in 1991 and 1992.",

The direct effects have been estimated at about 17 per cent in 1991 and 12 per cent in 1992 for the whole population of households. Our initial estimates of the effects of behavioral adjustments (Simulations 1 and 2) suggested about a 5 to 10 per cent additional increase in inequality once behavioral changes were also taken into account. However, most of this effect cannot be attributed to the tax reform but to the dynamic specification of the model which captured, for instance, the rising inequality of wage rates in Sweden in the early 1990s. A second approach to evaluate the effects of the tax reform involved comparing the income distributions obtained with the 1991-1992 tax systems (Simulation 1) with those which would have resulted if the 1989 tax system had still applied in 1991 and 1992 (Simulation 4). According to this comparison, the new tax system generated an increase in inequality of about 15 per cent. When this estimate is compared with the 17 per cent estimate of the direct effects, the indirect behavioral adjustment effect would thus seem to be very small.",

In MICROHUS the labor supply adjustments are small, partly because the decision to join the labor force is independent of incentives from the tax system (by assumption) and partly because the estimated wage rate and income elasticities for those already employed are relatively small. The labor supply literature has shown that the participation decision depends more on wage rates and income incentives than does changes in hours of work. A re-specification which introduces more economic incentives into the module, and which simulates entrances to the labor market might thus increase the adjustment effect. The application of supply functions for hours of work of the Hausman type could also be criticized. There is certainly scope for improvements and alternatives. For instance, a good labor supply model should give a better representation of the joint decisions of two spouses.",

It might also take longer than a year or two before these effects become manifest.
