                "text": "Up-to-date, nationally representative household income/expenditure data are crucial for estimating poverty during the Covid-19 pandemic and to policy-making more broadly, but many developing countries lack such data. We present new pandemic poverty estimates for South Africa, simulating incomes in pre-pandemic household surveys using contemporary labour market data to account for job losses between 2020 Q1 and 2021 Q4. Improving on much of the existing literature, we use observed rather than simulated shocks and allow for uneven impacts of the pandemic by employment sector and demographic characteristics. We present three updating methods, each of which give primacy to a different data source, and include diagnostic and robustness checks. Giving primacy to the 2017 National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) Wave 5 produces the largest estimate of pandemic-period job-loss-induced poverty: a headcount ratio increase at the upper-bound poverty line of 5.2 percentage points (3.1 million people/13 per cent) and poverty gap increase of 3.8 percentage points (21 per cent). Giving primacy to the contemporaneous Quarterly Labour Force Surveys (QLFS) data produces the lowest estimated change: a headcount ratio increase of 3.0 percentage points (1.8 million people/7 per cent) and poverty gap increase of 2.5 percentage points (12 per cent). Giving primacy instead to the official 2014/15 Living Conditions Survey (LCS) results in poverty increases between these outer bounds. Simulating receipt of a new pandemic-period social assistance cash transfer, the Special COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress social grant, substantially mitigates poverty effects, with a poverty headcount increase of 1.1\u20133.4 percentage points and a poverty gap increase of 0.2\u20131.5 percentage points.",

At the time of our analysis, the latest dataset released was for 2021 Q4, which follows the ending of the stricter lockdown measures. While there are many aspects to our updating procedure, the core of the approach is changing individual employment statuses in the LCS and NIDS to match the pandemic employment effects evident in the QLFS, and then applying attendant changes in incomes.

Note that this aggregate is based on income, rather than consumption, and therefore not the same as the official welfare aggregate. As a result our results do not provide an update to the official poverty statistics but provide estimates of the change in the poverty level. We also do not conduct a full tax and benefit microsimulation model, which means we do not take into account the changes in indirect taxes due to the impact of the loss of income and Special COVID-19 SRD benefits on indirect taxes, and the resulting impact on the estimates of the change in poverty.

To take a simplified example, consider matching on levels in NIDS, using gender as a demographic characteristic and formal/informal employment as employment sector. In this simplified case there are only three different possible employment groups\u2014formally employed, informally employed, and non-employed\u2014and only two different demographic groups\u2014female and male. Our matching algorithm does not directly adjust employment rates in NIDS so that the <i>aggregate</i> NIDS employment rate matches the <i>aggregate</i> 2021 Q4 QLFS employment rate; rather, it matches the distribution of employment groups <i>for each demographic group</i> so that women (and men) have the same proportion of individuals in formal employment (and informal employment, and non-employment) in NIDS as in the QLFS. This ensures that aggregate employment rates approximately match while reflecting the prevailing labour market structure, which is essential for poverty and inequality outcomes.

A fully interacted version of this would be equivalent to the cell-by-cell approach that we implement. The advantage of such a regression approach would be that one could include fewer interactions, which would increase precision especially since there is an issue of a small number of observations in many cells. On the other hand, the disadvantage relative to the fully interacted approach would be that any non-interacted covariates rely on extrapolation which may be outside the common support of the actual employment probabilities of these groups, and also rely on a particular (variance-based) weighting of the covariate effect which may be less desirable than a proportions-based weighting in a prediction context.

As is the case with NIDS, the LCS has higher baseline employment rates than the contemporaneous QLFS. The matching process seems to work well for the demographic categories we match on, as the implied changes over time in the LCS match the QLFS better than is the case for NIDS. Contributing factors for this may be that the larger sample size of the LCS and the lack of industry information means matching with substantially fewer cells, thus leading to less noise from matching on small cell sizes and distortions caused by empty cells in the QLFS or base data. The trade-off of less industry information is that the updated LCS likely does not reflect changing industrial structure\u2014types of jobs\u2014as well as NIDS does.",

Only imposing employment losses is likely to lead to a potentially substantial overstatement of the net employment loss over the February\u2013April period, and indeed <a href=\"#bib3\">Barnes et al.

However, in reality, those who became unemployed over the pandemic would be unlikely to increase their grant receipt\u2014indeed, SASSA offices were frequently closed and the social grant application process takes time in any case. This means the reweighting may erroneously increase grant receipt in 2020, or other characteristics associated with non-employment.",

We do not adjust grant receipt from what is reported in NIDS 2017 (and LCS 2015), and to the extent that the distribution of grant receipt changed in the years preceding the pandemic this may cause some inaccuracies in our analysis. In contrast, <a href=\"#bib3\">Barnes et al. (2021)</a> and <a href=\"#bib56\">Van de Heever et al. (2021)</a> simulate grant receipt based on <i>de jure</i> eligibility, which may account for some changes in grant receipt over time but then risks introducing simulation errors. These decisions in turn raise the question of how grant values are adjusted over time. Because we do not separate grant income out from disposable income at large, we inflate grant values by the same factor as market incomes, as discussed in Section 3.1. This could create inaccuracies, but we do not expect it to be particularly consequential because grant increases over these periods were roughly in line with headline inflation.<sup><a href=\"#fn23\">23</a></sup>",
