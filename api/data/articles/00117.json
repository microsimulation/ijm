                "text": "Microsimulation models seek to represent real-world processes and can generate extensive amounts of synthetic data. The parameters that drive the data generation process are often estimated by statistical models, such as linear regression models. There are many models that could be considered for this purpose. We compare six potential models, discuss the assumptions of these models, and perform an empirical assessment that compares synthetic data simulated from these models with observed data. We chose six regression-style models that can be easily implemented in standard statistical software: an ordinary least squares regression model with a lagged dependent variable, two random effects models (with and without an autoregressive order 1within-unit error structure), a fixed effects model, a hybrid model combining features from both fixed and random effects models, and a dynamic panel model estimated with system generalised method of moments. The criterion for good performance was the proximity of fit of simulated data to the observed data on various characteristics. We found evidence of violated assumptions in our data for all the models but found that, for the majority of data characteristics assessed, all the models produced synthetic data that were a reasonable approximation to the observed data, with some models performing better or worse for particular characteristics. We hope more modellers will consider and test the assumptions of models used for parameter estimation and experiment with different model specifications resulting in higher quality microsimulation models and other research applications.",

In a continuous-time DMSM events can occur at any point in time and thus time-to-event models are the primary statistical estimation technique. In a discrete-time DMSM, which is the focus in this paper, values are simulated or updated in discrete time steps, most often, annually. Discrete-time DMSMs have primarily used dichotomous or categorical variables and transition probabilities have been estimated by constructing tables from available data or using logistic regression models. Continuous variables, especially those where the value of the variable in one time period affects the value in the next time period (i.e. state dependent variables), pose more of a challenge and a range of techniques have been used in this instance. These techniques include a variety of regression models as well as more theoretically driven equations that maximise a utility function (<a href=\"#bib35\">Spataro, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bianchi, Romanelli, &amp; Vagliasindi, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">van Sonsbeek, 2010</a>). <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a> shows the regression-based techniques that have been used for continuous variables in a number of DMSMs. The choice among these techniques is not simple, yet there been little formal discussion or comparison of regression-style estimation techniques for DMSMs.",

We use the development of a discrete-time DMSM to model the trajectory of a birth cohort as an opportunity to assess the performance of six candidate regression-style models in generating continuous data that closely reproduces the empirical data. For this purpose we used an established longitudinal study in a New Zealand city (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fergusson &amp; Horwood, 2001</a>). In our empirical assessment we included techniques that have been used in other DMSMs (as outlined in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>), even where fundamental statistical assumptions may have been violated. Our interest is whether the parameter estimates from a given model, are able to inform a DMSM that accurately reproduces empirical observed data, regardless of whether the assumptions of the model are met. Although the assessment performed here is specific to our dataset and the results cannot be generalised to others creating an MSM, we trust that it encourages modellers to experiment with different model specifications and provides ideas on what models to consider and on how a comparison between then can be undertaken.",

The simplest way to do this is to use the Anderson-Hsiao levels estimator (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson &amp; Hsiao, 1982</a>), a two-stage least squares approach.

Two broad categories of GMM dynamic panel estimators are difference GMM and system GMM.

Since this technique estimates an equation in differences, it does not give estimates for time-invariant variables.

This is possible by making an additional assumption that allows another set of instruments to be used for an equation in levels (as opposed to the equation in differences). The lagged values used as instruments for the equation in differences are transformed (e.g. by differencing) to make them exogenous to the individual effects. System GMM estimates parameters using a system of these two sets of moment conditions. The additional instruments can dramatically improve efficiency over difference GMM estimation.",

It simulates from birth to age 13 and assesses the influence of child, parental, and family factors on various outcomes. Time-variant attributes are updated at each year and no new individuals enter or leave as the simulation progresses through time. The primary dataset used to estimate parameters for the MELC micro-simulation was longitudinal data from the Christchurch Health and Development Study (CHDS) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fergusson &amp; Horwood, 2001</a>). This dataset was used to test and illustrate the statistical models assessed. The CHDS cohort consists of children born in 1977 in Christchurch, New Zealand. The original birth cohort consisted of 1265 children, however we only used the data collected annually from ages 8 to 13 (as these were the years for which our outcome variable for the empirical assessment, reading score, were collected). By age 8 there were 1171 children remaining in the cohort; this remained relatively stable over time with 1172 children at age 9, 1067 at age 10, 1073 at ages 11, 12, and 13.",

It was important to choose a state-dependent variable for the empirical comparison as the within-person consistency or dynamism is a key aspect of the synthetic data to assess.

For the RE, RE-AR(1), FE, and hybrid models it is possible to simulate reading scores at age 8 but, for consistency and a fair comparison, year 9 was also the first simulated year for these techniques.",

Third order autocorrelation in the differences was only found for 3 of the 30 training datasets. The final model had 44 instruments to estimate 16 coefficients.

The degree of dynamism in the simulated reading scores under the various statistical techniques was compared to that in the observed reading scores. The measure used to quantify the degree of dynamism was the correlation between the reading scores with the lagged reading scores (the LDV). For a child with reading scores at every age from 8 to 13, five pairs of values are used to calculate this correlation (where a pair is a set of one current and one lagged value). This was calculated individually for each child in the data, providing a vector (length equal to the number of children in the simulation) on which 101 percentiles from 0 to 100 were calculated.

In the first we treated the \u2018means by time-invariant predictors\u2019 and \u2018means by time-variant predictors\u2019 characteristics as a single data characteristic when taking an overall average summary measure. Using a weight of 1/5 for each of the five \u2018means by time-invariant predictors\u2019, a weight of 1/3 for each of the three \u2018means by time-variant predictors\u2019, and a weight of 1 for all other data characteristics accomplished this purpose. In the second weighting scheme the eight \u2018means by predictors\u2019 characteristics were considered a single data characteristic To accomplish this, the weights for the five measures for time-invariant predictors should sum to 0.5 (giving each a weight of 0.5/5 = 0.1) and the weights for the three measures for time-variant predictors should sum to 0.5 (giving each a weight of 0.5/3 = 1/6).

The empirical assessment aims to test which models perform the best on our specific dataset, even though, for each, there is evidence of violated assumptions. Although the system GMM dynamic panel model does not make many of the assumptions the other models make, the violation of the assumption regarding the additional moment conditions (necessary to estimate effects for time-invariant variables) could be very important; again, the empirical assessment aims to give some light as to how important.",

Our assessment here aims to encourage modellers to experiment with different models in the process of making this choice. We demonstrated various criteria that can be used to assess the performance of parameter estimates from a model in reproducing observed data. For our specific data we found that data simulated from parameters from an OLS regression model with an LDV most closely represented the observed data. The fixed effects model performed second best followed by the standard random effects technique, and then the system GMM dynamic panel model and the hybrid model. The random effects AR(1) model ranked last. For the most part, however, all of the models generated synthetic data that replicated the observed data to a reasonable degree, with certain models performing better or worse on particular data characteristics. Although the simplest technique of an OLS regression including an LDV was found to perform well in our case, this result cannot be considered generalizable. Given the potential bias in the estimates from this model due to the violation of assumptions, it will be important for other modellers to perform their own sensitivity analysis to gain insight into the confidence they can have in using this technique (or any others where assumptions are broken) for their MSM or research application. We hope the comparative assessment performed here will result in more modellers comparing the effects of different modelling choices, which will ultimately help to improve the quality of, and strengthen the confidence in, microsimulation models and other research based on statistical models.",

We had available to us a number of variables that had not been included in the any of the models. These were tested to see whether they were potential instruments by testing for instrument relevance and exogeneity (using routines in the ivreg2 suite). We identified nine instruments. We were not able to test the exogeneity of all the predictors in a single joint test due to there not being enough instruments to identify the model, so each predictor was tested for exogeneity individually while treating all other variables in the model (the set of predictors, including the LDV) as exogenous.",

For the OLS-LDV model the LDV was included in the model and the cluster option was not used meaning that the panel structure of the data would be ignored (as in done in the OLS-LDV model). For the RE model, the cluster options was used such that the panel structure was recognised and the LDV was not included in the model. No convenient tests were available to mimic the RE-AR(1) model and so the tests for the RE model should be referred to for the RE-AR(1) model. For the FE model, the xtivreg2 function was used with the fe and cluster option and the LDV was not included in the model. For the hybrid model, the same options and as used for the RE model were used except that the meaned and deviation score forms of the time-variant predictors were used in the model instead of the variables in their original forms. The tests were not conducted for the GMM dynamic panel model as this model does not need to assume exogeneity of predictors.",
