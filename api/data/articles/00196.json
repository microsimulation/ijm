                "text": "A key challenge facing developing countries when they are gradually building up their social protection system is the presence of a large informal sector. Social safety nets should be expanded to reduce poverty but financing social protection through higher taxes may reduce the number of formal-sector jobs available. The aim of this paper is to quantify the impacts of a revenue-neutral expansion of social protection in a developing country on both income distribution and efficiency which we measure via the impacts on formal sector work. Results from a new tax-benefit microsimulation model for Ghana, GHAMOD, are combined with the extensive margin elasticity of the share of formal work with respect to the tax wedge on formal labour, derived from repeated cross-section econometric estimates. The size of the estimated formality elasticity is modest and therefore the distributional gains of expanding cash transfer programmes are considerable, even when taking into account behavioural impacts.",

Many of these countries are in the process of scaling up programmes and planning social protection systems, as opposed to isolated programmes. If one takes seriously the first of the new Sustainable Development Goals (\u2018Ending poverty in all its forms\u2019), and the fact that not all households can have members who actively participate in income-earning activities, at least some level of social protection should be deemed necessary. In developed countries, the system-wide impacts of social protection policies are often examined ex ante using tax-benefit microsimulation models, but few developing countries have access to such models.",

The estimates are based on a repeated cross-section approach, where the data are divided into groups that are formed using exogenous characteristics of household members (such as their age, education, and sex) and the impact of taxes on the share of formal work is identified from group-time interactions in a model with group and time fixed effects.<sup><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup> The implied increase in the tax rate that is needed to finance the social protection policies is combined with the estimated elasticity of formal sector work, and therefore the impacts of the policy reform are calculated also taking into account behavioural responses.

Ghana has experienced substantial growth in non-farm self-employment since the late 1980s, which many consider the outcome of large structural changes in the mid-1980s; see for instance <a href=\"#bib6\">Bank of Ghana (2007)</a> and <a href=\"#bib19\">Osei-Boateng and Ampratwum (2011)</a>.

While around four out of five of workers in the formal sector (83 per cent) in 2012 had completed secondary education or higher, this was true for less than half of workers in the informal sector (46 per cent). Formal sector workers have better education and they reside in urban areas more often than informal sector workers do. Formal sector workers are often employees and they typically work for the service sector (which includes public sector workers), whereas many informal sector workers work in the agricultural sector.

Second, we use GHAMOD, the microsimulation model for Ghana, to simulate two different policy reforms: a stand-alone expansion of social protection and a revenue-neutral expansion of social protection financed through an increase in employee payroll tax. Next we combine the changes arising in the net pay differential between the formal and informal sector due to the policy changes with the formality elasticity estimated in the first step, to gauge the effect on the size of the formal sector. Finally, we recalibrate the weights taking into account the changes in the size of the formal sector, before calculating the overall effects of the policy and behavioural changes on poverty and distributional outcomes and the government budget.",

According to conventional economic incidence analysis, a reduction in the income tax paid by workers can lead to a reduction in their asking wage, and therefore increase employment. Such a mechanism is, however, not possible, if the tax cut affects workers whose employment probability is distorted by the presence of a minimum wage. For such workers, even if a tax cut would lead them to be satisfied with a lower gross wage, this would only lead to an increase in the supply of labour and not to an increase in employment (which is restricted by the minimum wage).<sup><a href=\"#fn7\">7</a></sup> It is for this reason that in the estimations below we mostly focus on workers who are paid wages above the legally binding minimum wage. Another potential complication would arise from general equilibrium effects on wages\u2014gross pay could be a function of the changes in the number of workers, but as in most micro-econometric tax studies such issues are assumed away in the basic set-up.",

One is that the key regressor on the right, (<i>x<sub>f</sub> \u2212 x<sub>s</sub></i>), is endogenous: if a person moves from the informal to the formal sector, net income changes. Second, net income is only observed for one state (informal/formal) at a time. The solution is to utilize a group-based pseudo panel approach, where the data are aggregated to groups, defined based on exogenous characteristics (such as sex, age, education), and the equation is estimated at a group level. Then, group mean values are used to get an estimate for (<i>x<sub>f</sub></i> \u2212 <i>x<sub>s</sub></i>) for each individual. The approach can also be interpreted as an instrumental variables approach, where group-time interactions are used as excluded instruments for (<i>x<sub>f</sub></i> \u2212 <i>x<sub>s</sub></i>) in a model with group and time fixed effect added to an equation like (2).",

Both reforms together thus amount to a total of GHS 710 million of additional expenditure for the state budget. In a revenue-neutral setting, on the other hand, government more than doubles its income from employee SSC (from 486 to 1192 GHS million, Column 3 in <a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a>) to offset the additional expenditure due to the extension of social protection.<sup><a href=\"#fn14\">14</a></sup>",

Specifically, the share of the formal sector increases in (i) the initial size of the formal sector, (ii) the relative change in net pay, and (iii) the elasticity of formality. The difference in the poverty and government budget implications of the reform between the static and dynamic calculation is therefore directly related to the magnitude of these three terms. Out of these, we would argue that the first, the share of the formal sector, is fairly reliably measured in the data; our estimate of its size is also close to external information from <a href=\"#bib3\">Alagidede <i>et al</i>. (2013)</a>. We therefore conduct sensitivity analysis with respect to the latter two parameters, the elasticity of formality and the change in the net wage.",

We therefore repeat the calculations by assuming an elasticity equal to 0.75. We also experiment with changing the relative change in net pay (which is around \u221210 per cent in the base analysis). One could argue that using mean values of net incomes for all formal and informal sector workers could overestimate the wage difference between the two sectors, if for instance a high proportion of informal sector workers are relatively immobile rural agricultural workers with low pay. This would, in turn, underestimate the relative change in the net pay when taxes are increased. A more detailed analysis of the data reveals that the pay difference across sectors is indeed somewhat smaller in urban areas. However, the urban formal sector gross wage is also higher on average, implying that the relative change in net pay is approximately \u221213 per cent when calculated among the urban sector workers only. This reasoning led us to check the implications of using a \u221215 per cent change in the net pay in the dynamic analysis.",

The cost of the programme would be approximately GHS 700 million and financing it with an increase in the social security contribution of formal sector employees would imply raising the rate by approximately eight percentage points.

First, the estimated elasticity could be larger, and we have carried out some sensitivity analysis with respect to the size of the elasticity. Second, since the data set was originally prepared to study consumption, the income data are not necessarily as reliable. Third, the poverty eradication effects would be greater if, instead of modelling the tax increase via the flat social security contributions, progressive income tax were used. One further issue is that all those working in the formal sector are modelled to pay taxes. However, while their income from their main job is subject to third-party withholding by employers, they can still evade taxes from other income they earn and, arguably, the extent of evasion may also depend on the tax rate. This means that the exact size of the tax rate increase is only estimated with some margin of error. As always in microsimulation models, we have not allowed for any \u201cleakage\u201d due to administrative costs or misspent revenues by the social protection administration: a point with perhaps more relevance in a poor-country context with more limited government capacity.
