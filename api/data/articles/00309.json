While this provides valuable insurance to those who lose their job, a stronger link between unemployment benefits and previous earnings can exacerbate the moral hazard created by unemployment insurance. We examine strengthening this link for unemployment benefits in Ireland using SWITCH \u2013 a tax and welfare microsimulation model for Ireland \u2013 to simulate the financial work incentive impact of a proposed reform to current unemployment benefit policy. We find that implementing an earnings-related unemployment\u2019s benefit leads to reduced short-term incentives to work for all those currently in employment, with the impact being greater for full-time employees.",

The median NRR values in the baseline are quite high across all quintiles, ranging from a low of 63 percent in the richest quintile to a high of 71 per cent in the second quintile, which indicates that many households are well insulated from unemployment shocks under the current system. The median NRRs increase under the reform across all quintiles, showing the increased unemployment protection it provides. The share of these gains is distributed quite evenly across all quintiles, with the richest quintile benefitting least, but only by a small margin. The median NRR increases from 67 per cent to 79 per cent for households in the first quintile and the same increases from 63 percent to 73 per cent in the richest quintile. This increased protection under the reform comes with the cost of reducing the incentive to work in each quintile, again to roughly similar levels. Results for PTRs by decile follow a somewhat similar pattern (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), although greater increases occur in the poorer quintiles. The median PTR increases for those in the poorest quintile from 47 per cent to 71 per cent and for those in the richest quintile from 47 per cent to 62 per cent.",

A disproportionate number of households in the richer quintiles reached the maximum cap for their out-of-work income under reforms that use the PUP caps. These households can now augment their out-of-work income, up to the level of the new higher cap. Many lower-income households also increase their out-of-work income, but not to the same extent as individuals from richer quintiles. Hence, richer quintiles benefit by a disproportionate amount under this reform.",

This means that in the event of an unemployment shock, an individual\u2019s JB payment would equate to a higher share of their employment income compared to the current JB policy. This would ensure smoother income and consumption patterns across the job status transition, leading to increased welfare in unemployment compared to current policy. Under Reforms that use the PUP rate as a maximum cap (main reform and reform 3), the share of these gains is distributed quite evenly across all quintiles, with the richest quintile benefitting least, but only by a small margin.<sup><a href=\"#fn23\">23</a></sup> Under Reforms that use the median earnings as a maximum cap (reform 2), the richer quintiles observe the greatest reduction in the incentive to work, as well as the greatest increase in unemployment protection. High-earning individuals end up with the lowest absolute incentive to work. This indicates that lower maximum caps not only reduce the additional fiscal spending required but distribute the gains from the reform in a more equitable manner.",

This highlights the very significant effect of cushioning the negative income shock of unemployment. In contrast, under Reform 3 which uses a maximum cap set at the median earnings, the biggest increase in this share is for individuals in the richest quintile, with the two poorest quintiles having the smallest increase in the share. The absolute values of the shares demand careful consideration, as they highlight a low incentive to work, particularly for those in the lowest four quintiles. The vast majority in these quintiles face an NRR greater than 70 per cent. Additionally, we examine those with NRR greater than 70 per cent separately for part-time and full-time employees. We find that the share of individuals with NRRs greater than 70 per cent is higher for part-time employees in the baseline. Possibly for this reason, part-time employees face a lower increase in this share after the reform. Full-time employees seem to benefit more from the reform.",

Indeed, research has shown that a vast majority of those with NRRs close to 100 per cent in Ireland are actually in paid work (<a href=\"#bib35\">Savage et al., 2015</a>). A number of reasons could explain this. For example, young individuals could have weak financial work incentives at the beginning of their career but remain in employment as they expect their situation to change in the future (<a href=\"#bib26\">Keane et al., 2021</a>). In addition, individuals could take up paid work even where there is a weak financial incentive to do so because they fear otherwise being subject to some form of sanction or disqualification from social welfare payments, with previous research finding that such measures increase re-employment rates for jobseekers (e.g. <a href=\"#bib3\">Abbring et al., 2005</a>). Lastly, non-financial factors, such as social interaction or status linked with a particular job, could encourage individuals to stay in employment even when the financial incentive to do so is weak (e.g., <a href=\"#bib29\">Kosfeld et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rosso et al., 2010</a>).",

This highlights the trade-off between insurance and incentives that linking unemployment benefits to previous earnings involves, and that governments must ultimately attempt to balance. One way of doing so is by applying time-limits to the duration of benefits (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pavoni and Violante, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pavoni et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, such an approach is already applied in Ireland with the duration of jobseekers\u2019 benefit limited to a period of 9 months for most claimants, down from 12 before the financial crisis.<sup><a href=\"#fn26\">26</a></sup> As well as helping balance the trade-off between insurance and incentives, more tightly time-limiting the level of jobseeker\u2019s benefit or setting a replacement rate that declines stepwise with the duration of jobseeker's benefit, increase the importance of considering interactions between jobseeker\u2019s benefit and (means-tested) social assistance payments like the jobseeker's assistance. How to best design these payments in combination is a question on which there is not a clear consensus, with the heterogeneity in welfare effects across groups, emphasised by <a href=\"#bib40\">Haan and Prowse (2024)</a>, worthy of further study in both Irish and international contexts.",

SWITCH simulates the direct tax liabilities and social welfare entitlements of the Irish population using the nationally representative Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC). SILC is an annual household survey conducted by the CSO that collects detailed information on individuals\u2019 incomes, along with detailed demographic information. The data have also been reweighted to match 2019\u2019s official statistics about employment, unemployment and the gender-age profile of the population \u2013 as reported by the CSO \u2013 as well as a forecasted version of the 2019 income distribution for employees and the self-employed. In the reweighting process, existing targets set by the CSO for the SILC weights about the household composition and the regional distribution of the population were also kept. We uprate these quantities to 2022, then use SWITCH to simulate the net change in household disposable income for each of the reforms examined in the paper.",
