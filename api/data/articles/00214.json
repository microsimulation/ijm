The first version was operative in 1990, and its main use has been projections and policy analyses regarding the design and evaluation of the Norwegian pension system. The aim of the paper is to provide an updated overview of the model with technical platform, comparison with other dynamic microsimulation models, the main events included and its main use.",

These probabilities are estimated from observed transitions in a recent period. For years with actual observations simulation and transition probabilities are aligned to these. As common in several other dynamic microsimulation models (cf. <a href=\"#bib31\">O\u2019Donoghue and Dekkers, 2018</a>), events like births, deaths, migration, marriages, divorces, educational activities, labour force participation, retirement, income and wealth are included in the simulation.

Like models in France, Canada and US, MOSART is situated in a statistical office and thus benefits from easy access to microdata. In addition, the MOSART project is fortunate to be embedded within a strong tradition of model-based policy analysis. Laying the groundwork for policymaking in Norway has for more than half a century been a collaboration between The Ministry of Finance (and other ministries) and Statistics Norway, with theoretical support from the academic sector, especially the University of Oslo.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> It is still the case today that Statistics Norway operates a wide selection of planning models actively used by the government, including both static and dynamic microsimulation models, macro models and environmental models.",

This has resulted in emphasis being given to developing and maintaining a large, detailed and up to date database, and to doing simulations where current behaviour (often in the form of constant transition probabilities) continues indefinitely into the future. This constant behaviour assumption is unrealistic, but uncontroversial and easy, at least in principle, to understand. This facilitates planning because it precludes difficult discussions of how to model future behaviour (and governments might have their own thoughts on behaviour), while providing a consistent framework within which to discuss policy. Since MOSART has a central place in policy discussions it is also occasionally used by other public institutions, private organisations and the media. Even though policy analysis has priority, academic work is important in maintaining the quality of the model. An example of this is the work on mortality and life expectancy documented in <a href=\"#bib2\">Brinch et al. (2018)</a>.",

The order of the processes in recursive simulation is important since earlier events may affect later events in the same period. The modelling in MOSART also follows the classical structure of such models with \u2018recursive blocks\u2019 that simplified may be presented as (i) the demographic block, (ii) the education block, (iii) the retirement block, (iv) the labour market block, (v) the earnings and income block, (vi) the pension benefits block and (vii) the fiscal block.",

As common in the other models, simulations are based on the confrontation of the deterministic part of a logistic regression model with a logistic random variable. The simulation will normally also use variance reduction methods. The simplest (and most common) variant is binomial events, where the expected number of events is equal to the sum of transition probabilities. By adding up these probabilities as each individual is handled, an event occurs every time the sum passes an integer value. The number of events will be constrained to its expectation value, and each individual will with some precautionary steps have a probability of experiencing an event that is equal to its transition probability. Variance reduction methods have a decisive effect on clarity, particularly that even small deviations cannot be explained away as mere simulation noise.",

The reason for this apparent complication is the pension reform. Old age pension benefits will by this procedure depend on time of withdrawal <i>and</i> possible earning of pension entitlements after withdrawal. Full access to all modules for historical years is also an upside. We will for this reason have a close to seamless transition from history to simulation, with access to data and tables for historical years and improved possibilities for testing the model.

Large variations in the annual number of births and thereby TFRs during the first half of the 1900s are still important for understanding the dynamics of the number of elderlies and projections of pension expenditures with the MOSART-model. The most important aspect is the low number of births between the two World Wars due to the economic depression. An increase in fertility from 1935\u20131946 measured by periodic TFR can probably be explained by postponing births until the economic depression and the following war was over. The large birth cohorts from 1946 until about 1970 replacing the small cohorts born between the wars is in combination with higher life-expectancy the main reason behind the expected large increase in Norwegian old-age pension expenditures from 2015\u20132040.",

Moreover, realized educational transitions are a combination of the behavior of individuals making choices and institutions offering places in education. To disentangle the two is challenging. Any trends in observed educational transitions could therefore not be interpreted as trends in behavior. Moreover, educational enrolment varies over the business cycle, and using an average over several years makes it possible to make projections that are neutral to business cycle conditions.",

It is therefore important that decisions on stopping to work and the withdrawal of pensions must be linked together. In MOSART we therefore have found it convenient to model retirement before the other elements of labour supply. This also helps model the new system for old-age pensions which gives individuals great flexibility in combining withdrawal of pensions when still working. The model includes three different types of retirement; old-age retirement (including early retirement), disability and work assessment allowances (WAA). It is most convenient to model all these decisions in the same block of the model. Although the focus in MOSART is on long-term benefits, WAA is included because a period with this allowance is almost mandatory before disability pension may be granted. For those receiving a disability pension, MOSART simulates the degree of disability (between 50% and 100%).",

In general the probabilities for retirement into old-age or early retirement from the age of 62 and onwards depend on age, gender, achieved education level, and which sector one works in. In the private sector the probabilities for retirement shifted because of the reform in 2011. After the reform probabilities are mainly adjusted so that the desired average age of retirement neutralizes changes in life expectancy (the desired age of retirement increases just enough so that the present value of the pension is unchanged). In the public sector probabilities for early retirement are calibrated to reflect the proportion retiring at different ages observed in the past years. With the present system persons on early-retirement in the public sector will be transferred to old-age pensions at the age of 67. Those in the public sector born in 1963 will be the first cohort embraced by the new system built on the same principles as in the private sector when they reach the age of 62 in 2025. We model changes in sector for individuals until they reach the age of 61. Persons on WAA or disability pensions are also transferred to old-age pensions at the age of 67.",

A stable career path is a characteristic derived from an individual\u2019s working history. We hope, at a later point in time, to incorporate information on immigrant background and the sector in which a person is working. A stable career path is given by a dichotomous variable which is one if a person, for every year from the age of 23, has lived in Norway and had an income of 1 BPU or more or been under education. This variable has a strong positive effect on the probability of working and a strong negative effect on becoming disabled during the following year. The probabilities are adjusted, by changing the constant term in the probability equations, so that the aggregate number of individuals working (as defined above) for historical years is consistent with observations from Statistics Norway\u2019s Labour Force Surveys.

(2012)</a>, and not influenced by the reform of the system in 2011, NIS is an integrated part of the Central Government budget and financed PAYG. Yearly expenditures do not have to be balanced by specific contributions, and pension expenditures are financed by general tax revenues. From 1973 until the reform in 2011, old-age pensions in NIS could be claimed with defined benefits (DB) from age 67 and were earnings-tested until age 70, until a stepwise repeal of this test was imposed between 2008 and 2010. Because of the early retirement schemes introduced in 1989 covering about 60 per cent of the employees in the private sector and all employees in the public sector, it was possible for employees belonging to these schemes to retire from the age of 62 without any consequences for benefits from NIS after the age of 67. Towards the end of the 1990s it was evident that growing longevity and large cohorts born after World War II would cause expenditures in this DB-system to increase substantially in the coming decades.",

Two agreements in the Norwegian Parliament in 2005 and 2007 indicated that a broad political majority supported a reform along the suggested lines, with some adjustments. Based on a tripartite agreement between the Government, the trade unions and the Employers\u2019 Confederation the early retirement scheme in the private sector was incorporated in the new system from 2011. No corresponding agreement was reached between the Government and the trade unions in the public sector. The early retirement scheme and occupational old-age pensions in the Government sector were therefore only partly adapted to the new system leaving the early retirement scheme unaffected. However, by new negotiations an agreement to change these schemes corresponding to the system in the private sector was reached in 2018 with major effect from 2025 when those born in 1963 reach the age of 62.",

Early retirement leads to lower annual benefits because accumulated entitlements must be divided by more years. This is also the case when life expectancy increases for a given retirement age.

But because life-expectancy adjustments are more lenient for minimum pensions, persons in the first decile are less hurt by the reform than others. Although persons with high labour market incomes also seem to lose less from the reform than persons with medium incomes, NIS for old-age pensions is still highly redistributive over the lifecycle. Because of longer life expectancy for women and elements in the system for accumulation of entitlements favouring women, NIS also redistributes incomes from men to women. After the reform total lifetime pensions are only around 20 percent of total lifetime earnings for men from the third decile and above.",

Among those components that are classified as generally redistributive (from rich to poor) the income ceiling appears to be the most important for closing the gender gap followed by the guarantee pension and the tax system.

Using a microsimulation model, pension wealth may be calculated under realistic and detailed assumptions about job market behavior, choices of retirement age and individual expected longevity (based on socio-demographic characteristics). As pointed out by <a href=\"#bib1\">Blanchet et al. (2017)</a> the complexity of the pension system implies that an approach using dynamic micro-simulation seems to be far more efficient in projecting pension entitlements than an aggregate approximation. Micro-simulation allows a detailed account of the pension legislation at the individual level, applied to a heterogeneous population. An additional strength of the MOSART model is that the individual work histories are quite accurately embedded in the model due to long panels of register data. Furthermore, due to the Norwegian pension reform introduced from 2011, accumulation of entitlements from both the old and the new system can be considered.",
