                "text": "In 2007, a major tax reform was put into place in Uruguay with the explicit goals of promoting both greater efficiency and equity in the tax system. Overall, the reform substantially increased direct income taxes by establishing higher and rising marginal rates; lowered indirect taxation; reduced the corporate tax; harmonized employer contributions to social security across sectors and eliminated some highly distortionary taxes. We assess the joint effects of these changes on macroeconomic and labor outcomes, poverty and inequality using a top-down static CGE microsimulation approach. Overall we estimate a 1% increase in GDP and a 2% increase in employment due to the reform. We find substantial general equilibrium effects of the full implementation of the reform that tend to reinforce the reduction of poverty indicators, exclusively due to the modifications of the direct personal income tax without considering behavioral responses. Regarding poverty, the general equilibrium effects are significantly greater than the direct effects. Overall, we estimate a one-point reduction of the Gini coefficient due to the reform.",

The shift towards direct income taxation in replacement of indirect instruments such as commodity or production taxes, in order to achieve equity and efficiency goals, follows some important results from optimal taxation theory (see <a href=\"#bib17\">Diamond &amp; Mirrlees (1971)</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Atkinson &amp; Stiglitz, (1976)</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Saez (2004)</a>).

Nearly 70% of fiscal revenues (excluding social security taxes) originated from the value added tax (VAT)and other indirect taxes. A corporate tax accounted for a further 13% of these revenues. The direct personal income tax amounted to only 5% of total fiscal revenues, and it only affected wages and pensions, while capital income was not taxed. As such, the system did not respect the criterion of horizontal equity (see <a href=\"#bib27\">Perazzo, Robino &amp; Vigna, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barreix &amp; Roca, 2003</a>). The value added tax rate was one of the highest in Latin America (with a basic rate of 23%) and a large number of sales taxes only contributed to a small share of fiscal revenues. Finally, some studies pointed out the regressive nature of the pre-reform tax structure, showing that there was scope to use the tax reform as an instrument for redistribution (<a href=\"#bib23\">Grau &amp; Lagomarsino, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barreix &amp; Roca, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">2006</a>).",

Using this methodology, Amarante, <a href=\"#bib5\">Arim and Salas (2007)</a> assess the effects of these two modifications on poverty and inequality, finding small positive effects. The impact on poverty is largely explained by price reductions resulting from the change in the value added tax, assumed to be entirely translated into consumer prices.",

Household behavioral responses to variations in their budget constraint following the shock on the personal income tax include changes in consumption demand and labor supply. Modified VAT rates result in new market-clearing prices and quantities via consumer and producer optimization, and can lead to variations in the sectoral structure of the economy. The employer contribution to social security is part of the labor costs in each sector, so its variations affect labor demand. Finally, the reduction of the corporate tax should affect returns to capital. This would affect relative factor prices, as well as the level and allocation of new investment.",

CGE models allow simulating behavioral responses and adjustments on several markets, while enabling some flexibility in setting macroeconomic rules to assess the impact of different government revenue allocation policies. Combining the CGE model with a microsimulation model makes it possible to include the general equilibrium effects of the tax reform and account for full household heterogeneity (see <a href=\"#bib14\">Colombo (2010)</a> for an analysis of alternative CGE-microsimulation approaches). CGE models have been widely used to analyze tax policy since the seminal papers of <a href=\"#bib30\">Shoven and Whalley (1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">1984</a>).

It consists of simulating, at the micro level, the labor market and income structure obtained from the CGE macro simulations (\u201ctop-down\u201dapproach).The counterfactual microsimulation methodology follows a non-parametric technique. It does not specify income and labor-choice models as proposed in Bourguignon, <a href=\"#bib11\">Fournier and Gurgand (2001)</a> or in Bourguignon, <a href=\"#bib10\">Ferreira and Lustig (2001)</a>. Instead, it assumes that occupational shifts may be approximated by a random selection procedure within a segmented labor market structure. A Monte Carlo procedure is then used to obtain confidence intervals for the outcomes of the simulations (poverty and inequality coefficients). The important assumption made is that, on average, the effects of the random changes within segments correctly reflect the impact of the actual changes in the labor market.",

Increased disposable income leads to higher aggregate household demand, mainly due to the combined changes involving the personal income tax and the VAT. This demand is met by increased imports and domestic production, with a related increase in factor demand.

Replacing VAT revenues with the direct personal income tax increases disposable income for all household groups except the richest decile (see <a href=\"#table7\">Table 7</a>). Furthermore, the elimination, reduction or uniformization of some indirect taxes (such as the intermediate consumption tax, the health tax or ECSS), together with the shift towards direct taxation, tend to reduce price distortions on markets for good and factors. 5 As factors are assumed to be perfectly mobile across sectors, this change induces a better reallocation of resources and stimulates economic activity.",

These results are clearly driven by the greater progressiveness of the direct income tax. Per capita household income grows by an average of 0.2% in the 1st decile and 0.6% in the 2nd decile.

The most important counterfactual changes driving these results are reduced unemployment and growth in average wages and capital income indicated by every CGE simulation. Moreover, general equilibrium effects strengthen the observed \u201cnext day\u201d reduction of the incidence of poverty, the poverty gap and the severity of poverty. The size of these effects is much greater than the \u201cnext day\u201d effect. The average 2% increase in the wage rate and the approximately 2 pp reduction in the unemployment rate, with particularly notable effects for the unskilled workers that are predominant in lower income households, are the most important labor market changes underlying this poverty reduction. As for inequality indicators, general equilibrium effects lead to a minor additional reduction of the Gini coefficient for total household income (in the same direction as the arithmetical simulation) and do not affect the Gini coefficient for labor income.",

Taken together, they tend to reinforce the progressive nature of the \u201cnext day\u201d effects of implementing its main policy, i.e. the introduction of a direct personal income tax with higher progressive marginal rates to replace the previous wage and pension tax. Although this is an expected result, it reinforces the importance of evaluating these types of macro reforms using methodologies that account for potential reallocation of resources due to changes in prices of goods and factors due to the policy.",

In other words, when government revenues increase due to the tax reform (and allow an increase in either government provision of public services or government savings), the reform also results in employment and wage growth and reduced unemployment, generating positive general equilibrium effects on average household income and poverty. This obviously does not mean that the government\u2019s use of additional revenue is irrelevant. The simulations that alter either government consumption or savings accounts tend to crowd out private consumption or savings, with probable future negative effects on private capital accumulation. When the government budget is held fixed and additional reductions of the VAT rate are allowed, the reform generates the most positive effects in relation to economic activity, poverty and inequality.",

This is done through the elimination of the intermediate consumption tax and the health tax, and reductions in the VAT and ECSS, with any revenue losses being compensated for by an increase in direct taxation. Reduction, elimination or harmonization of these taxes tends to reduce price distortions of goods and factors. In a context of perfect factor mobility across economic activities, this leads to a better reallocation of resources, stimulating an expansion of economic activity.",

Despite an elastic labor supply in the model, the final simulated changes in participation rates were insignificant and robust to sensitivity analysis. However, progressive marginal tax rates on household income could also have negative impacts on private savings, with negative implications for dynamic capital accumulation. In the long run, non-linear marginal rates on income may also induce negative effects on human capital accumulation by lowering the wage premium for the more educated. These aspects are not considered, and they would require further analysis using a dynamic framework.",
