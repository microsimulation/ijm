                "text": "We present ongoing work on the construction of a spatial microsimulation model to assess the influence of demographics on residential heat consumption for Hamburg, Germany. Demographics are important for urban energy planning as: (1) Buildings are becoming more energy-efficient and building occupant behaviour accounts for a growing share in the variation of consumption; (2) building occupant needs are changing along with demographic change; and (3) the share of small decentralized district heating grids, in which fewer customers mean less averaging out of heterogeneous occupant profiles, is set to play a bigger role in the country\u2019s heat supply. We construct a spatial microdata set for the city of Hamburg (of roughly 1.8 million inhabitants and 370 000 buildings), with households populating geo-referenced buildings, in three steps: (a) Synthesizing the population of small scale \u201cstatistical areas\u201d, comprising up to around 2000 people (we do this by selecting households recorded in the German microcensus and fitting them into the statistical areas); (b) assigning energy relevant properties to the geo-referenced buildings from the Hamburg digital cadaster (we do this by making use of a well-established building typology developed for energy assessment) and constructing dwelling units in these buildings; and (c) matching households to the dwelling units in these buildings (which we do again by using household data from the microcensus). This last step \u2013 allocating households to buildings \u2013 may be the most interesting and challenging task. As of to date, we use a combinatorial optimization algorithm to achieve this. Once we have a microsimulation model of buildings and households living in them, including their demographic composition, the range of questions that can be explored is immense. The illustration presented here is a simple heat balance computation of individual buildings, using the constructed socio-demographic data and the digital cadaster data as input parameters.",

The impact of occupants and their behaviour on building heat consumption is increasingly drawing interest from the urban energy planning community. In the past, the influence of occupants on building heat consumption was considered negligible. Building heat consumption was dominated by the nature of the building shell and the heat transmission losses it allowed. The last couple of decades, however, has seen a tightening of energy efficiency standards in building construction, greatly reducing transmission losses through the shell, thus increasing the impact that occupant behavior has on heat consumption. This also applies to the building stock in the course of retrofitting.",

More ambitious efficiency requirements are on the horizon. The building stock, too, has shifted into the policy focus of the German energy transition, as German buildings are largely already built, and the rate of new construction is only about one percent of the total building stock <a href=\"#bib20\">Kleemann and Hansen (2005)</a>. This means that the challenge lies in reducing energy use and CO2 emissions of existing buildings. This is done with: (1) energy-efficiency retrofitting of the building shell (reducing heat transmission losses through heat insulation); (2) increasing the efficiency in the heat supply, and (3) replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources or heat from co- generation.",

Because we only allow integers for the number of dwelling units, the total number of dwelling units may differ from the total number of households. This may be seen as realistic, as there may be some vacant dwelling units in the statistical area. The other possibility, that there are not enough dwelling units for the households in the area, may also arise during the simulation. To solve this problem, we implement a factor in the computation of the average dwelling unit size specific for each statistical area.

From the building typologies of the digital cadaster we compute the following parameters that are used as input to the heat accounting method: (1) Building dimensions, as absolute northing and easting displacement difference, thus implying an orientation of the building; (2) Building height, as number of stories times 3 meters, needed for the computation of the envelope area; (3) Roof slope, estimated based on the roof type, needed for the computation of the envelope area; (4) Percentage of glazed area, for the computation of transmission losses and solar gains, taken from the attributed building type; (5) U-value for the roof, for the computation of transmission losses, taken from the attributed building type; (6) U- value for the walls, for the computation of transmission losses, taken from the attributed building type; and (7) U-value for the windows, for the computation of transmission losses, taken from the attributed building type.",

In order to estimate the average working hours of the single individuals we use the parameters describe in <a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a>. With these parameters, we estimate the working hours of every single individual. Because we use the parameter of working hours as an indicator of presence in the dwelling unit, we take the minimum number of working hours out of the set of all household members, thus aiming to describe the presence hours of the one household member that is at home the most. So, for example, for a family with one parent working full-time and the other parent working part-time, the working hours of the household will correspond to the working hours of the parent working part-time. Another important variable is variable ef163, which describes if one of the individuals belonging to the household works at home.

Most of the defined energy balance norms or models take a limited number of parameters as input; in particular there are few parameters that are related to occupant behaviour. This is because the aim of the standard method is the estimation of heat demand for the \u201caverage\u201d occupant.

We use a method from the microsimulation community (the Hill Climbing algorithm) to select families from the census database and allocate them into small statistical areas within the city. From the digital cadaster we attribute the corresponding buildings with energy relevant characteristics. In a third step we allocate the selected families into individual buildings. The buildings with it inhabitants serve as input data to a simplified heat balance model following the German DIN V 18599 standard.",
