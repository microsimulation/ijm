                "text": "Illicit heroin use is a worldwide problem, with significant health and social costs. Treatment is known to be effective in changing heroin use habits, but it often needs to be provided over a lifetime, with people cycling in and out of treatment. It is therefore important to capture a long-term perspective on heroin use careers. The aim of this project was to build a lifetime microsimulation model of heroin using careers. This paper describes the conceptual logic of the model, the input parameters and the verification and validation results. A microsimulation model was chosen as the most appropriate simulation platform with 9 states, and 111,400 individuals (aged between 18 and 60) each with gender, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and HCV (hepatitis C) status, and treatment history. Probabilities associated with crime commission and individually calculated lengths of stay in each state were determined from multiple datasets. The model included costs associated with treatment provision, healthcare services, criminal activity, life years lost, and family benefit of treatment. The final model represented 42 years of a heroin use career for a cohort based on Australian (New South Wales) data. Individuals cycle into and out of heroin using states (including abstinence), as well as treatment and prison states. We were able to build a stable, tractable model and verified all parameters. Validation against external data sources revealed high validity. While there are limitations associated with any model, the heroin career model now has the potential to be used for simulations of alternate policy scenarios.",

                    "text": "Heroin is an illegal drug that is widely abused. It is estimated that there are around 16.5 million heroin users worldwide (a 0.4% population prevalence rate). This does not include pharmaceutical opioid misuse, which is growing at a very fast rate (<a href=\"#bib93\">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2015</a>). Australia has one of the higher rates of heroin use internationally and is estimated to be around 1% of the general population (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare [AIHW], 2013a). In Australia, heroin is purchased on the black market and usually injected. A person dependent on heroin will inject three to four times a day, and will experience withdrawal symptoms if they reduce or cease using heroin. The costs to society of heroin use and dependence are substantial and include both healthcare costs and the costs associated with crime. The social costs of illicit drugs has been estimated to be AUD$8,189 billion (<a href=\"#bib15\">Collins &amp; Lapsley, 2008</a>) in Australia with similar per capita estimates from other nations (European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addition [EMCDDA], 2008, 2011, 2014). Given the size of the economic burden, it is not surprising that governments across the globe expend considerable funds in trying to better manage illicit drugs. In Australia, the federal and state governments spend about AUD$1.7 billion per annum in prevention, treatment, harm reduction and law enforcement to combat illicit drugs (<a href=\"#bib71\">Ritter, McLeod, &amp; Shanahan, 2013</a>). Of the total spending, the majority was allocated to law enforcement, leaving a small proportion to prevention, treatment and harm reduction. There is increasing pressure from both the government and the public to know whether the current spending is optimal or what needs to change to increase the benefits of spending. This is particularly important for complicated social problems, such as heroin use, where there are many external costs.",

As per <a href=\"#bib83\">Siebert <i>et al</i>. (2012)</a>, a typical STM consist of a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive health states where individuals can transition among health states based on predefined transition probabilities. STMs are flexible and transparent computer-based decision making models which include both Markov model cohort simulation and individual-based microsimulation. Cohort-based Markov model is one of the predominantly used STM in the substance abuse field (<a href=\"#bib77\">Schackman, Leff, Polsky, Moore, &amp; Fiellin, 2012</a>). Cohort-based Markov models are relatively simple to develop when the number of health states is not large. These models are restricted by the Markovian assumption, where transition probabilities do not depend on individual history or memory (i.e. past health states or state duration) (<a href=\"#bib83\">Siebert <i>et al</i>., 2012</a>). In the case of heroin use, it is recognised that an individual\u2019s history of incarceration, treatment, and length of time in treatment has an effect on the state transition for that individual (<a href=\"#bib42\">Hser, Evans, Huang, &amp; Anglin, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Zhang, Friedmann, &amp; Gerstein, 2003</a>). Therefore, MSMs, which are not restricted by the Markovian assumptions and number of health states, are more appropriate for modelling heroin use careers. MSM reduces the number of health states required as it simulates an individual\u2019s history by using tracker variables.",

MSMs can model individual characteristics, treatment and heroin use history as continuous variables, whereby future transitions depend on current and past individual history. MSM has been widely used to evaluate health policies and other social and economic policies in many countries. It serves as an effective tool for policy evaluation, decision making and allocation of scarce financial resources. Many large MSM models have been built in Australia and overseas (<a href=\"#bib10\">Briggs &amp; Sculpher, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Harding, Keegan, &amp; Kelly, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Karnon, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Ringel, Eibner, Girosi, Cordova, &amp; McGlynn, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Rutter, Zaslavsky, &amp; Feuer, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Zucchelli, Jones, &amp; Rice, 2012</a>). However, there are very few MSM models that have been built to specifically evaluate illicit drug treatment policies (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hoang <i>et al</i>., 2016</a>). It is noted that it is important to build an MSM specifically for a country/state due to the differences in health care financing structure, costs and benefits, as well as the substantial difference in the availability of treatment methods and drug use.",

The participants were then re-interviewed at 3, 12, 24 and 36 months to observe the change in the modalities of treatment, as well as some critical aspects of heroin use such as demographics, criminal activities, health and employment over time. The transitions out of the modalities of treatment started at the baseline are expected to reflect the path/progression for people who use heroin.

Several verification tests were defined for each of the modules to verify the intermediate simulation outputs. The logic for transition of individuals within the conceptual model was matched with the output from the simulation model using Eclipse IDE debugger. To verify that the conceptual logic was correctly coded in the computer program, we randomly selected 100 individuals in the simulation model and traced their behaviour and matched that against conceptual logic. The transition summary from the model for these 100 individuals was manually compared against the expected transition summary. The transitions for these individuals matched the conceptual logic implemented in the computer program. In this situation, we verified the simulation response by running a simplified version of the simulation program with a known analytical solution. A simplified version of the model was run according to the changed parameters, i.e., age was fixed to 20 years, treatment history of individuals were assumed to be 1 episode each of S4 \u2013 S7, LOS for all individuals was assumed to be 360 days, initial population was considered to be 100,000, mortality rates for HIV, Hep-C was assumed to be zero, and initial population was distributed equally from state 1 to 10 (i.e. 10,000 each). The analytical solution obtained by using the above mentioned parameters in the transition functions was then used to compare with the simplified simulation model.",

In relation to treatment patterns, there was excellent validation for the no treatment state movements (62% of the MIX sample, who were not in treatment at baseline, were not in treatment one year later. For our model this percentage was 63%). However, the simulated state transitions from OST did not match validation data: MIX showed that a large majority of participants remained in OST one year later (81%), whereas the model kept only 33% of individuals in OST one year later. The likely cause was the shorter LOS in S6, and the model insistence on individuals going to S1 (for at least one day) after S6. We undertook two adjustments to improve the model\u2019s validity: revision to the S6 LOS and verification of the age/sex S6 formulae (which were initially incorrect). In the final model, the pattern from the MIX (validation data) was largely upheld, especially in the later years in the model. For S6, the MIX validation data show significantly increasing percentages over 5 years (from 36% at baseline to 67% at year 5). In the modelled result, the increase over the first five years is more modest (from 36% to 53%). However, by year 21, it is 68% and commensurate with the MIX data.",

There also appears to be very good validation of the treatment exposure over time compared to ATOS year 11 results (median number of treatment episodes and days in treatment).

The model development described herein followed good modelling practice described in <a href=\"#bib48\">Karnon <i>et al</i>. (2012)</a>. The model has been verified internally by extensive logic reviews with domain experts and by analysing the simulation response by running a simplified version of the simulation program with known analytical solutions. All of these were consistent with expected modelling parameters and assumptions. Various features of the model were validated against external datasets and published data in this field, which were not used as an input for model parameterization.

In real-life, there are more than nine possible states for heroin use, including some other, relatively minor treatment types, such as injectable heroin. It is not possible to represent every possible treatment state in the model: the data are simply not available and the model itself would become intractable. Additionally, there are gradations in heroin use. Our model somewhat crudely provides for three heroin use options: abstinence, irregular use or dependent use. While these three capture the broad array of heroin use, within each of the three, there can be much heterogeneity; for example our abstinence state (S1) includes both, those who are temporarily abstaining for a brief period of time, and those who have \u2018recovered\u2019 and will never resume heroin use. The parameterisation of LOS by individual characteristics overcomes this to some extent. In the prison states only one treatment type was considered (OST) for individuals receiving treatment in prison. This was due to the paucity of datasets informing different type of treatments received by drug using individuals. There was a lack of past research data to drive the mortality probabilities beyond those determined by state and LOS, but this is an important area for further work. Finally, the individual level model required a significant amount of data for modelling various aspects such as individual history, LOS, incarceration, mortality, and transitions to community. Moreover, the computational time required to run the model is generally higher than the simplified cohort based compartmental models.",

The main outcome of policy interest from these simulations is to compare the Net Social Benefit under the current status quo (that is the basecase model results) with the Net Social Benefit produced by the alternate scenarios.
