                "text": "Microsimulation studies typically assume that all entitlements to means-tested benefits are actually claimed by eligible households, despite a large body of research that suggests that take-up rates are substantially below 100%. The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform. This paper investigates the impact of non-take-up for two hypothetical scenarios, namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by \u20ac100 per month. We find a substantial effect of considering non-take-up on the simulated change in fiscal costs and in particular on the change in caseloads, where the full take-up assumption exaggerates the latter change by a factor of about two.",

We find that having a high (low) qualification significantly reduces (increases) the probability of take-up, with a high marginal effect (in absolute value) for being highly qualified. Contrary to our expectations, we find a significant, but small positive effect of being a male head of household. The dummy for home ownership shows a very strong negative effect on the probability of claiming SA. From the set of regional dummies, the dummy for residing in eastern Germany is significant for all specifications, with a very high positive marginal effect on the take-up probability, which probably reflects a worse labor market situation than in western Germany. Finally, the dummies on migration status are in general insignificant, with the exception of the dummy which indicates being a migrant from an EU state, which has a negative impact on the take-up probability for the pooled probit and IV probit, but not for the RE probit.",

The approach of <a href=\"#bib21\">Pudney <i>et al</i>. (2006)</a> reflects that the probability of take-up should change with the level of the benefit and thus with the rules of the benefit system and that individuals with observed welfare benefit take-up will likely experience lower costs of take-up than those who did not claim their entitlement. The framework also considers sunk costs of take-up, i.e., the possibility that a share of take-up costs will be non-recurring in nature.",

Therefore, en- dogenizing the take-up decision is a crucial component for analyzing means-tested benefit policies using a microsimulation model. These results are robust with respect to the estimation approach employed for the take-up equation.

This means that persons who are eligible for HB and CA and whose total entitlements from these two benefits are at least as high as the entitlement to social assistance would be have to take up the former benefits. In our analysis non-take-up of SA implies non take-up of either an SGB II or an SGB XII entitlement. In order to determine eligibility for SA, a person first has to be classified as either employable or not employable. The legal definition of employability is rather vague.<sup><a href=\"#fn19\">19</a></sup> Thus, employability in the sense of the SGB II cannot be precisely determined using information from the GSOEP. In the model, we categorize a person as employable if he or she is aged between 15 and 64, does not work in a sheltered workshop, and either has a degree of disability smaller than 80%<sup><a href=\"#fn20\">20</a></sup> or receives earned income. If a household is categorized as unemployable and passes the eligibility check for SGB XII benefits, the model compares the claim of SA to a possible claim of HB. The model assumes that the household will take up the greater benefit. If, on the other hand, the household is classified as employable and passes the eligibility check for SGB II benefits, the model also checks eligibility for CA. Households are eligible for CA if the parents\u2019 income is high enough to cover their own basic needs (determined by the SGB II), but not the basic needs of children in the household. In the case of eligibility for CA, the model compares the sum of CA and a possible claim to HB to the SGB II benefit and again assumes that the household claims the higher benefit.

We define the available SA benefit as the amount of SA the household is eligible for according to our microsimulation model. A number of additional household characteristics are used to approximate the utility from claiming SA. For example, both singles and households with children (single parents and couples) will be more likely to claim SA, since, on the one hand, the absence of a partner removes a source of potential income for the household and, on the other hand, children represent dependents for whom the parents are responsible. This holds in particular if young children are present in the household. A higher degree of needs might be perceived if members of the household are in need of care, particularly if the head of the household is disabled. From a dynamic perspective, the latter household characteristics will also tend to increase the perceived duration of being needy, which in turn should lead to a higher probability of claiming SA.",

In some cases (e.g., \u201csingle parents\u201d or \u201cdisabled head of household\u201d) the assumed effect on information and/or stigma costs works in the same direction as the effects on utility. In the case of single parents we assume lower stigma costs, since single parents may perceive themselves as being more needy than couples, who can share the burden of work and childcare. For this reason we expect these variables to have an unambiguous impact on the likelihood of take-up. This is not the case for variables like \u201cage\u201d or \u201cqualification\u201d, implying that we are agnostic about the sign of these coefficients. Additional variables, which should mainly be related to the costs of claiming SA, are \u201csex of the head of household\u201d (higher social stigma for males), \u201carea of living\u201d (rural or metropolitan relative to intermediate area, where stigma in rural areas should be higher because of higher social control), a dummy for living in eastern Germany and for home owners. We hypothesize a positive relationship between living in eastern Germany and the degree and duration of needs, which should mainly reflect a worse labor market situation than in western Germany. Home owners, on the other hand, are likely to need SA for a shorter period than non-owners, if the earning potential of owners is higher on average. At the same time, a home owner\u2019s fear of being forced to sell her home may detain her from claiming SA. We are agnostic about the impact of the migrant dummies on the take-up decision. Migrants \u2013 on average \u2013 have a higher degree of needs, but at the same time face higher information costs (language barriers).
