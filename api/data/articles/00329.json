Combining a microsimulation model SIMTASK with Household Budget Survey data lets us quantify the net effect of the shock after government relief measures and adjustments in wages and social transfers. In line with literature, we show that government measures along with automatic valorisation mechanisms helped to offset welfare decline mainly for low-income families. For high-income families wage growth was the crucial component offsetting their purchasing power drop. Considering inflation-related effects solely, our results indicate a welfare drop of 7% for an average family in 2022. The reversed result for 2023 (increase by 5%) is mainly due to the delay in economic adjustments. On the two-year horizon, the combination of policy measures and economic adjustments, on average, almost fully mitigated the negative effects of the inflation surge. Assessing total changes (also including inflation-unrelated effects), an increase in disposable income exceeded the inflation burden significantly for all analysed family categories. A generous permanent income support for families with children was the main driver of the welfare increase of 9% on average. We also point to high heterogeneity of the impact across families. Despite positive average effects, 14% of families faced a welfare drop.",

First, we want to see the uncompensated effect of surprise inflation, without any government measures related to the shock or consequent economic adjustments. Therefore, if there is a price cap on energy prices, we regard it as a government measure and, in this scenario, we introduce a price increase without the price cap. In the next step, we add the effect of economic adjustments. By these we mean the difference in economic indicators according to the pre-shock and after-shock forecasts \u2013 for example a wage growth in the inflation scenario above the originally expected wage growth. In the final step we add the effects of government measures. We choose to add this scenario at the end, because the effect of some of the government measures may depend on final wages or pensions. In this scenario we also include the energy price cap. Simulating these four scenarios, and by their differences, we obtain all the effects we want to evaluate: the uncompensated effect of price increase, the cushioning effect of economic adjustments, the cushioning effect of government measures and the resulting final net effect.",

So, the families in the model are not able to adjust their consumption habits even if the prices are different. In a richer setup, wealthier families would have more options to cope with higher inflation, they could decrease their savings or change their consumption habits and buy cheaper alternatives of the products they were used to. Therefore, the results presented in the paper represent an upper bound of static (\u201cday after\u201d) effects on purchasing power. But as shown by <a href=\"#bib19\">Sologon et al.

The variation in the total welfare effect is significant within the income categories. The variation, when measured in nominal terms, increases with income. However, the fact that government policies were targeted at specific population groups plays a role as well. This is most obvious in case of the no-shock scenario.

The more children a family has, the stronger is the cushioning effect of government measures. This is a result of the fact that the anti-inflationary measures were disproportionally targeted at families with children. The share of all one-off payments allocated to the child benefit reached 75%, with families receiving a one-off benefit per each child. However, government measures along with economic adjustments were not sufficient to outweigh the effect of increased prices. As a result, families in all categories faced a drop in purchasing power, ranging from negative 4% (single parents with 3 and more children) to negative 7% (categories without children).",

In 2023 the price cap significantly compensated for the drop in purchasing power. The shape of the resulting net welfare impact is determined mainly by the effect of valorisation.

The drop in purchasing power was most frequently faced by singles without children (23%). On the other hand, there are no families with three or more children facing a drop in purchasing power. Families with more children were protected from the drop as they received more generous support by the government. Even if using this categorisation, the variation in the size of the effect is still high (see <a href=\"#A1-F7\">Figure A7</a> in the Appendix). One of the reasons being the fact that only families with labour income are eligible for child tax credit, while at the same time the amount of the child tax credit is restricted by level of earnings of the family. Thus, e.g. a family with two children, depending on level of its earnings, might be eligible for any size of child tax credit between not being eligible at all to a full amount. Another source of variation relates to income structure as well. The higher the share of pensions in the income, the more the family benefits from governments measures targeted on pensioners.",

The relative impact for the bottom decile was almost 6 times larger than the average support, while the impact for the top decile was less than one third of the average support. For high-income families, economic adjustments were the component that helped to offset a significant part of their purchasing power decrease.

It turns out that despite high inflation, the compensating effects of macroeconomic adjustment, hand in hand with a generous price cap on energy prices and government measures, more than offset the decrease in purchasing power for an average family. The recipients of pension benefits are the part of the population that received the highest compensation. Thanks to the automatic indexation mechanism, high inflation from 2022 was transferred into significantly elevated 2023 pension benefits. On top of that, pensioners received an extra increase in pensions due to adopted government measures (earlier indexation of pension benefits and a one-off allowance of 300 euros). According to our estimates, the overall net effect on purchasing power for an average family is positive and reaches 5%. However, our results show that families with the lowest income faced the lowest welfare increase (1%), mainly because the share of pensions in their income is much lower compared to other income deciles.",

We conclude that, on average, the compensatory effects almost fully mitigated the negative effect of price increases. As most of the anti-inflationary fiscal measures were targeted at pensioners, they are the only part of the population facing an increase in purchasing power when looking strictly at the effects related to the inflationary shock.

Initially, the increase of children-related benefits, announced by policy makers, was proposed as to cope with the income poverty of families with children. Later, these measures started to be officially interpreted as government interventions to cushion the effects of high inflation. Child benefit and child tax credit were substantially increased from July 1st, 2022, and in the second step from January 2023. The child benefit is a flat payment per dependent child to parents and the increase is adopted in the legislation as permanent. Working parents with dependent children are eligible to receive child tax credit (only one of the parents can apply). Child tax credit has also been increased from July 2022 and in the second round from January 2023 but, as opposed to the child benefit, this measure is valid temporarily until the end of 2024<i>.</i>",

Pensioners receiving old-age, early retirement, disability, or survivors\u2019 pensions got the one-off payment in December 2022, the so-called 14th pension (Since pensioners receive the 13th pension regularly every year, this payment is not considered as a special one-off to cope with high inflation.). Based on the amount of the pension, the one-off support, ranging from 35 to 210 euros, has been paid (pensioners with lowest pensions got the highest support). The average payment per pensioner was 143 euros and the total cost of this support reached 208 mil. euros. In addition, in January 2022 senior citizens over 60 years, who got vaccinated against COVID-19 disease, got the so called \u201cvaccination bonus\u201d. The bonus ranged from 100 to 300 euros, was granted by an automatic procedure, and the total expenses reached 278 mil. euros. In 2023 the parliament changed the valorisation rules for all types of pensions. As a result of new legislation and due to the high inflation rate at the beginning of 2023, advance indexation of pensions occurred in July 2023. All types of pensions were increased by 10.6% and the estimated costs of advance indexation are at 522 mil. euros in 2023<i>.</i>",
