The results suggest that income inequality increased during the 1990s, but that expenditure inequality remained stable. This paper is a revised version of Discussion Paper no. 56. This version corrects an incorrect equivalence scale used in the earlier work on expenditures for 1993-94 and adds results on current non-durable expenditure. In addition, it has now emerged that these results can be regarded as only preliminary, as the ABS revealed in April this year that it has concerns about the accuracy of the data for low income families in the income and expenditure surveys and intends to release revised versions of the unit record files.",

This study uses the various unit record files of national sample surveys undertaken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to look at this issue. Section 2 briefly summarises the methodology of this study. Much greater detail is provided in appendix A. Section 3 looks at trends in income inequality, first analysing results from the ABS Household Expenditure Surveys and then contrasting these with outcomes from the ABS income surveys (initially named the Income Distribution Survey but replaced in 1994-95 by the Survey of Income and Housing Costs). Arguably, spending is a better measure of economic resources than income and so section 4 examines trends in expenditure inequality in Australia. One of the key findings of this study is that, while income inequality has been increasing, current expenditure inequality appears to have remained stable. Consequently, section 5 explores the relationship between the income and expenditure patterns of Australian households, ranked by their income. This suggests that there was a marked change in the composition of the poorest 10 per cent of households in the past decade. Section 6 summarises the paper.",

One change is that the movement in the Gini coefficients between 1993-94 and 1998-99 is not statistically significant, again throwing uncertainty on how the income distribution changed over this period. In other words, the original data (when negative incomes were <i>not</i> set to zero) suggests that most of the increase in inequality occurred during the early 1990s, with lower unemployment perhaps helping to reduce the pace of inequality increases in the late 1990s (<a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>). It is also noteworthy that the gap between the \u2018set to zero\u2019 and \u2018not set to zero\u2019 Gini coefficients was greater in the 1990s than at the end of the 1980s, suggesting the possible increasing impact of negative incomes on the income distribution.

Thus it is valuable to compare income and expenditure inequality to determine whether this methodological choice alters apparent levels or trends in inequality. The Household Expenditure Surveys allow this comparison because they contain both income and expenditure data, whereas the income surveys do not collect expenditure data. Analysis of HES expenditure data also ensures that comparisons can be made back to the mid-1980s because the 1984 expenditure data are not affected by problems with the imputation of income tax.",

For example, a study using the Canadian Family Expenditure Survey over a number of years found that expenditure on non-durable items was more equally distributed than income in every year, with the difference being about 0.020 of a Gini coefficient (<a href=\"#bib21\">Pendakur, 1998, p. <span class=\"page-number\">266</span></a>). An Australian study using the HES data also found that expenditure inequality was less than income inequality (<a href=\"#bib8\">Barrett et al., 2000</a>). However, this result for Australia was derived from a modified HES dataset that excluded the top and bottom 3 per cent of observations and all households with a head aged less than 25 years or more than 49 years. This study also adopted a restricted measure of expenditure that excluded some consumer durables (see further discussion of expenditure measures below).",

For example, in 1998-99 the Gini coefficient for non-durable current expenditure of 0.277 is substantially lower than the Gini coefficient for current expenditure of 0.302. This is to be expected because many durables are luxury items (for example, jewellery, boats, golf equipment and cars) that are purchased disproportionately by households at the top end of the distribution. In theory, if the acquisitions approach to expenditure measurement causes spending on durables to be distributed somewhat randomly, this might tend to even out the consumer durables expenditure across the distribution.

This suggested a remarkably consistent relationship between spending and income for each income decile. The only area of major change was the sharp increase in the spending-to-income ratio of the bottom decile. This was not due to growing numbers of self-employed households in the bottom decile. Instead, it seems that the composition of the bottom decile had changed \u2014 more retired and childless \u2018working poor\u2019 households, and fewer social security dependent households with children. Thus it is possible that the entrants to the bottom decile had greater capacity than social security families with children to run down savings or to borrow to finance their spending, and that this had propped up the spending of the bottom decile in the face of their declining share of income.",

This seems to be inconsistent with the \u2018acquisitions approach\u2019 used by the ABS to collect expenditure data (see <a href=\"#bib5\">ABS, 2000</a>). Third, they ranked <i>households</i> rather than <i>individuals</i>, on the grounds that it could not be assumed that \u2018resources are equally shared within the household\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Blacklow and Ray, 2000, p. <span class=\"page-number\">325</span></a>). In other words, when constructing their inequality rankings, they counted a household with five people in it just once, whereas we counted it five times. In technical terms, this means that their results were \u2018household weighted\u2019 whereas our results are \u2018person weighted\u2019, which is the preferred approach in analysis of income inequality changes over time (<a href=\"#bib12\">Danziger and Taussig 1979</a>). Furthermore, Blacklow and Ray used the household as their unit of analysis and this typically implies an assumption that resources are equally shared within the household (see, for example, <a href=\"#bib5\">ABS, 2000</a>).",

There is conflicting evidence about the impact of this change (see \u2018Testing the inequality results for sensitivity to methodology\u2019 later in the appendix for details).",

It has not been possible to amend the data to fully account for these differences. Despite this, the scope of the most recent SIHC is fairly consistent with past income surveys, and similarly for the HES. Indeed, the scope of the HES and the SIHC is substantially the same (see <a href=\"#bib3\">ABS 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">2000</a> for details). First, the surveys are restricted to people living in private dwellings. These dwellings include houses, flats, home units, caravans and garages but excludes \u2018special dwellings\u2019 \u2014 hotels, boarding houses and institutions (for example, gaols or hospitals). The homeless were also omitted from these surveys, thereby ensuring that the following results fail to capture a group who are almost certainly at the bottom of the income distribution. Second, the survey population excludes Australian and non-Australian defence force personnel and diplomatic personnel of overseas governments and overseas residents. Third, the scope of the surveys excludes people living in \u2018remote and sparsely settled areas\u2019 (approximately 175 000 people in 1996-97). Finally, unit record files have weights attached, indicating what proportion of the population each record represents.",

In the 1975-76 and 1984 surveys, income tax was \u2018as reported\u2019 by the household with some imputation by the ABS. Such an approach sometimes results in households with low current incomes reporting relatively high income tax payments, as the tax payments relate to earlier periods when they enjoyed higher incomes. In the three surveys 1988-89, 1993-94 and 1998-99 income tax was entirely imputed by the ABS, based on the reported current taxable incomes of households.<a href=\"#fn4\"><sup>4</sup></a> In the 1984 Fiscal Incidence Study the ABS did go back and impute income tax for each of the HES households, and these estimates formed the basis of the estimates of income tax paid by gross income decile reported by the <a href=\"#bib1\">ABS (1987, p. 22)</a>. Our exploration of the data suggested that the \u2018as reported\u2019 income tax amounts are sufficiently different from the \u2018entirely imputed\u2019 income tax amounts that surveys using different approaches should not be compared. Thus, we believe that the 1984 results are not comparable with those of the later surveys if the \u2018as reported\u2019 tax variable on the public unit record file is used. As an interim measure we have run a regression equation through the published <a href=\"#bib1\">ABS (1987, p. 22).</a> estimates in the 1984 Fiscal Incidence Study and used the resulting coefficients to impute income tax to each household in the 1984 HES. Checks suggested that the results are far more consistent with the results for later years. It was not possible to use the same methodology to re-impute income tax in 1975-76, and this became a second reason for not using the 1975-76 data.<sup><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup>",

In 1982 current income is markedly more unequal than annual income, which is why studies using annual income have reported increasing inequality since 1982 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Saunders, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Harding, 1996</a>), while those using weekly income have reported stable inequality over some periods (<a href=\"#bib14\">Harding, 1997</a>).",

In some of the earlier years the variable on the total number of dependants did not always appear consistent with the total gained after summing the number of dependants within various age ranges. Accordingly, it was decided that the number and ages of dependent children could not be ascertained with complete reliability. As a result, when calculating needs-adjusted household incomes, only the total number of persons living within the household could be used with confidence within the equivalence scale. The equivalence scale used was thus the square root of the total number of persons living within each household.

None have received unanimous support. The three measures used in this paper have been chosen for their relative ease of interpretation and, to a lesser extent, their ease of calculation. One widely used summary measure of inequality is the Gini coefficient, which varies between 0 (when income is equally distributed) to 1 (when one household holds all income). Gini coefficients are derived from Lorenz curves, which compare the proportion of income (or expenditure) that is held by any proportion of the population. Thus, if income were distributed perfectly equally, the curve would be an increasing line: 10 per cent of the population would have 10 per cent of total income, 50 per cent of the population would have 50 per cent of total income, and so on. The Gini coefficient measures twice the area between this line of equality and the Lorenz curve and so, when the Gini is zero, the Lorenz curve is identical to the line of equality (hence, perfect equality).",

For the income inequality results derived from the expenditure surveys, the curves cross for 1993-94 and 1998-99 but evidence from other measures of inequality suggests that inequality continued to increase over this period. If, as suggested, we exclude the 1982 IDS and the 1996-97 SIHC from consideration, the only Lorenz curves that cross for the SIHC-based international scale household-level results are those for 1994-95 (Gini coefficient is 0.299) and 1997-98 (Gini coefficient is 0.302). The coefficients for these two years do not differ by a statistically significant amount anyway, so this does not constrain the analysis. The same argument holds for the analysis of current expenditure inequality: the curves cross for 1988-89 and 1998-99, for 1984 to 1993-94 and for 1988-89 to 1993-94.

Detailed information on the data collection process and relevant definitions can be found in user guides produced by the <a href=\"#bib5\">ABS (1997, 2000)</a>. As discussed in the paper, there is some level of agreement in the trends indicated by the expenditure and the income surveys. In particular, a consistent result is that income inequality increased from the late 1980s (HES 1988-89 or SIHC 1990) to the mid-1990s (HES 1993-94 or SIHC 1994-95). However, the Gini coefficients vary for the mid-1990s. The HES Gini coefficients increase (although, because the Lorenz curves cross, this does not unambiguously imply that inequality increased) while the SIHC results fluctuate but suggest that there was no real change between 1994-95 and 1997-98 (<a href=\"#A1-T2\">Table A2</a>). As noted earlier in the appendix, the choice of the unit of analysis can influence the trends. During the 1994-95 to 1997-98 period, the income-unit-level results tend to agree with the HES household-level trend (see <a href=\"#A1-T1\">Table A1</a>).<a href=\"#fn6\"><sup>6</sup></a>",
