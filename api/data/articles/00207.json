It documents how individual income components are aggregated into the EU-SILC target variables. Even though general and country-specific descriptions of income target variables are available in the EU-SILC methodological guidelines and in the national quality reports, it is often not clear how exactly each of the national income components is classified and aggregated into a target variable in practice. On the basis of a survey among national statistical institutes, we compiled a database which maps the exact classification of income components onto the EU-SILC target variables. The focus of the database is on EU-SILC 2015, covering 26 EU-SILC countries. The database contains information on the composition of variables regarding total income before and after transfers; income from benefits, work and capital; social contributions and taxes; as well as on recent and planned changes to the composition of the variables.",

The data are widely used for studying poverty and inequality in the EU and serve as the data source for official poverty reduction targets. Furthermore, EU-SILC is often used for monitoring the social situation both within countries and across countries, and for carrying out both ex-ante and ex-post policy evaluations. It is also the main dataset for European countries covered by EUROMOD, the tax-benefit microsimulation model for the European Union. The quality and comparability of the income variables in EU-SILC are therefore of paramount importance. The data collection of EU-SILC follows a so-called ex-ante output harmonization model: target variables that countries must collect are specified, but the exact way in which these variables are collected is up to the participating countries. Furthermore, the fact that tax-benefit systems differ considerably across countries, makes it sometimes difficult to aggregate income components in a consistent way into the relatively generic target variables of EU-SILC. As a result, the collection and categorisation of specific income components varies considerably across countries.",

This implies that researchers sometimes do not realise the wide variety in types of income sources that some variables cover, potentially undermining the validity of the conclusions of their analysis. Also, this constitutes an important hurdle for researchers who want to use EU-SILC for tax-benefit microsimulations, given that it is essential to know which income sources are categorised under which variable in order to simulate tax liabilities and social security contributions, or to validate simulated benefits and allowances. Often, it can be a cumbersome process to identify the exact classification of each income component.",

In the report, for each income variable used to construct total disposable household income (see <a href=\"#app1table1\">Table A.1</a>), we discuss compliance with Eurostat guidelines, misclassifications and omitted income sources that could undermine cross-national comparability. The sections for each target variable contain a summary with main findings, the variable definition in the Eurostat guidelines, general results on cross-national comparability, and a section with detailed remarks by country. In the working paper, we bring together the main findings from the report, highlight prospective changes to EU-SILC in response to our report, and formulate some recommendations regarding how comparability can be improved in the future. Apart from updating and expanding the MetaSILC 2015 database, our main recommendations include the establishment of an expert panel which would help Eurostat to improve the description of the target variables and help NSIs to aggregate all income sources into the EU-SILC target variables in a way that is consistent across countries. Also, the ex-ante output harmonization model could be strengthened by providing concrete examples of a \u2018preferred way\u2019 to ask questions regarding income in the EU-SILC questionnaires, especially with regard to the level of detail with which questions are asked and the examples that are given as income sources to be included (eg, when asking about income from capital), in line with what is already done for the variables on material deprivation. Other recommendations include setting up a repository for research that documents the impact on the income variables of moving from survey data to register data, and creating more consistency, and transparency, regarding the way in which NSIs convert net incomes to gross incomes and the other way around.",

In our opinion, the MetaSILC 2015 database, set out as a onetime survey among the data producers, proved to be very helpful for collecting detailed metadata on how specific income components were aggregated into the EU-SILC income target variables. Therefore, we believe it is a useful strategy to repeat and expand MetaSILC in the future, preferably by Eurostat, as it clearly provides essential information that is nowhere else available. Ideally, this would be done during the data production process, as at that point all required information is already available to NSIs. We are confident that for future updates, it should be possible to limit the required time investment on the part of NSIs. One can also think about ways to facilitate data users to share more information on the comparability of specific variables for specific research purposes.",
