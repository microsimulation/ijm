                "text": "In this paper we cross-validate two sources of data, administrative and sample survey, addressing an issue commonly faced by analysts regarding the relative reliability and comparability of these two data sources. By way of case study, the paper uses data presently available in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg. While administrative data extracted from the recently implemented Social Security Data Warehouse contains information about the whole population of Luxembourg (449,000 observations) in 2003, survey data, extracted from the Luxembourg household panel PSELL3/EU-SILC for 2004 (incomes from 2003), provides a representative sample of only around 3,600 private households (9,800 individuals) living in Luxembourg. The attraction of the survey is the more detailed information it provides on incomes, family relationships and other socio-economic dimensions. Our paper first analyzes the advantages and limitations of each dataset, before outlining and addressing methodological difficulties relating to their cross-validation. Through the cross-validation that follows we conclude that the survey database performs reasonably well in capturing the relevant characteristics of the resident population and allows analyses with respect to characteristics not found in the administrative database, and vice versa. Importantly we find that even if, on average, some monetary variables are different in the two datasets, the shapes of the equivalised income distributions broadly coincide. Even so, we observe a few important discrepancies at the extremes of the curves. Finally, through use of the EUROMOD microsimulation platform, we are able to show that the discrepancies observed between these income data sources are insufficient to significantly affect the conclusions drawn from analysis of policy alternatives.",

For example, the PSELL survey data offer detailed information on incomes, family relationships, and other socio-economic dimensions. On the other hand, the kind of administrative data provided by the Luxembourg Social Security Data Warehouse offers some important advantages over survey data, including completeness, timeliness, and the availability of time series data of different granularity, such as yearly or monthly data.

The father\u2019s (fiscal) household is associated with an equivalised income of 2,110 whereas the equivalised income attributed to the rest of the family is 1,000.

A search for further explanations reveals that this difference appears to be mainly due to a discrepancy in recorded employment income (about 90% of primary income, excluding capital income), which is 9% higher in the survey than in the administrative records. Interestingly, <a href=\"#bib12\">Nordberg (2003)</a>, using Finnish data, finds a recorded level of \u2018earned income\u2019 (conceptually similar to our \u2018primary income\u2019) lower for register data in 1995 but higher in 1999.",

And, perhaps more significantly, the two datasets differ with regards to their treatment of institutional households (c.f. <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>). To test this possible explanation, all single individuals without a dependent aged more than 75 years old were dropped from both the administrative-based dataset (as proxies for \u2018institutional households\u2019) and survey-based data (for symmetry reasons). As a result, the mean primary income rose from \u20ac1,384 to \u20ac1,464 in the administrative dataset, and from \u20ac1,493 to \u20ac1,539 in the survey dataset, with the confidence interval changing for the latter to \u20ac1,459 \u2013 \u20ac1,619.

This point is clarified below. Consideration of the other results presented in <a href=\"#table6\">Table 6</a> (columns A and C) is deferred to <a href=\"#s3-5\">Section 3.5</a>.",

In contrast, we are focusing here on indicators relating to fiscal households. Indeed, we are constrained by the administrative-based data where no information is available about resident households. It would therefore make no sense to compare our results with others published at the European or national levels, and based on resident households. Rather, one must remember that our main objective is simply the comparison of our two input datasets for cross-validation purposes.",

However, a larger share of the population below the poverty line does not say too much about the distribution of the \u2018poor\u2019 along the income line. For example, it can be shown that the intensity of poverty, measured by the \u2018income gap ratio\u2019, is lower through survey-based data<sup><a href=\"#fn17\">17</a></sup> : the poor, relatively more numerous, are nevertheless benefiting from equivalised incomes closer to the poverty line, on average. This \u2018concentration\u2019 effect is also broadly visible through the Gini coefficient when computed within the population under the poverty line. The coefficient is lower for survey-based data (0.0847) than for administrative-based data (0.0884). Moreover, it is well known that the Atkinson index with a high aversion to inequality is very sensitive to the lower end of the income distribution. For example, dropping only the first percentile of the equivalised income distributions from both data sources results in indices that that are not only closer, but that also become statistically compatible<sup><a href=\"#fn18\">18</a></sup>. This result is perhaps not overly surprising, given that panel data like the PSELL3/EU-SILC, although well suited for income distribution studies, often lack precision regarding the lower end of the income distribution due, for example, to low response rates in specific categories of the population, including \u2018poorer\u2019 households (see <a href=\"#s3-3\">Section 3.3</a>).",

For example, the upper decile mean for the elderly is 233% higher than the global mean in the administrative-based dataset (211% higher in the survey-based dataset). In similar fashion the upper decile mean for singles with dependents is lower, compared to the population mean, in the administrative data (203%) than in the survey data (214%).

Regarding individual characteristics, the usual tendencies prevail. For example, the members of households with dependents are less often taxpayers than the population on average.

In so far as differences have been observed, the unanswered question remains: how sensitive will the microsimulation of alternative tax systems be to these observed differences? To address this question, we now compare the outcomes resulting from the two datasets after changing the fiscal rules.

In all cases it decreases, varying significantly more between fiscal systems (0.23 without tax reform; 0.25 with tax reform) than between datasets (where the measurable difference is of the order of only 0.002-0.003). This drop in the inequality coefficient is mainly due to vertical redistribution<sup><a href=\"#fn19\">19</a></sup> of the tax system (Reynolds-Smolensky index).

This is illustrated by <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, which shows the change in mean equivalised income by decile. On the whole, the 2001\u20132 tax reform increases equivalised income, with the size of the increase dwarfing the difference between datasets (5.6% according to our survey-based data; 5.8% according to our administrative-based data). Moreover, the higher the decile, the higher the relative change. A 9%-increase of mean equivalised income is observed when considering the highest decile compared with less than 1% for the lowest decile, whatever the dataset.

This case study is, we believe, of wider interest because of the lessons it has to offer regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of survey and administrative datasets as inputs for microsimulation models. In particular, the nature of any discrepancies and the importance of these discrepancies relative to the kinds of differences likely to be observed downstream when modelling changes in fiscal systems are examined in the paper. Given the lack of previously peer-reviewed work in this area, we also hope that this paper might offer some valuable pointers to others considering embarking on a similar cross-validation exercise.

As a result of this process of harmonisation we had to drop about 6% of the initial population in both datasets and adapt the calculation of variables such as those related to capital income-related due to missing information in the administrative dataset. For the same reason it also proved necessary to adopt the fiscal household as the unit of analysis rather than the more usual resident household. Because fiscal households nest within residential households, this led to an observed distribution of equivalised income that departed from the usually observed residential-based ones, with lower values for both means (5% less when fiscal households are used) and medians (-6%). The at-risk-of-poverty rate and the position of the different categories of population were also affected.",

For monetary characteristics, a discordance is observed, mainly stemming from a gap in primary income, which is, on average, 7% lower in administrative-based data. The difference in primary income implies downstream effects on equivalised income. Even so, while the average equivalised income differs, the shapes of the income distributions recorded in the two datasets broadly coincide. For example, the Gini coefficient and other overall inequality indices most often show a statistically compatible distribution of equivalised income in the two datasets. The same most at-risk-of-poverty categories also show up regardless of the dataset under consideration, including \u2019singles with dependent(s)\u2019 and the members of (fiscal) households in which either nobody or only one person is working.",

Moreover, inequality indices focusing on the poorest households, like the Atkinson index with a high aversion to inequality, show some divergence between the two datasets. In this latter case it can be shown that differences in the first percentile of the distributions are sufficient to explain the divergence. At the other extreme of the distributions, a few striking differences were also noticeable between the datasets. These deviations are explicable in terms of known distortions in the collection of data regarding higher income levels.",

Our results show that, with the exception of one measure (Atkinson index with inequality aversion = 2), the discrepancy between datasets in the estimated values of a wide range of inequality indicators was far smaller than the observed change in inequality indicators between fiscal systems.",

Even if some variables may differ, on average, the shapes of the equivalised income distributions are similar, and the changes due to policy alternatives are most often remarkably comparable.
