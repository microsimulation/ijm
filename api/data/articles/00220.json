We focus on the situation at the Slovak labour market, where the increased inflow of foreign labour between 2012 and 2019 was driven by the demand for labour arising because of a need for replacing workers leaving the labour market. Using data from the Labour Force Survey, SLAMM simulates the development of domestic labour supply by reproducing the demographic processes, educational attainment, together with decisions on economic activity and employment. The discrepancy between the domestic labour supply and structure of employment expected by a macroeconomic forecast drives the projected inflow of foreign workers. The deficit of labour, driven mainly by the demographic change, is expected to be balanced by labour immigration. Besides its potential in predicting future labour supply, we also show some of the policy-relevant scenarios simulated by SLAMM.",

While population ageing is observable across all European countries, patterns in attracting and accepting foreign labour vary substantially between European countries. Here we adopt a perspective of a small, rapidly ageing EU country, which is not the usual target country for immigrants. Slovakia has recently experienced exponential growth in the number of foreign workers. The main driver of this inflow was the lack of domestic labour able to meet the steadily growing labour demand in a situation of declining overall labour supply. A similar situation can also be found in other new EU member states, such as Slovenia, Poland, the Czech Republic, but even more remote countries such as Malta.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup>",

By 2050, the total dependency ratio (ratio of population aged 0\u201314 and 65+ per 100 population 15\u201364) is projected to increase sharply in Europe (by 24.8 percentage points). During the same period, the total dependency ratio for Africa is expected to decrease by 18.7 percentage points (<a href=\"#bib24\">UNDESA, 2017</a>). Ageing in Europe is linked with a decline in the labour supply. This pattern is observable universally across all countries of the European Union (EU) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Van Der Gaag and Beer, 2015</a>). It is not only the total size of the population which matters but also the age structure driving the decline in the total labour force (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bloom et al., 2003</a>).",

If countries in a case of an increase in the labour force yield positive demographic dividends (<a href=\"#bib8\">Headey and Hodge, 2009</a>), in the cases of a decline of the total labour force this dividend is expected to turn negative and become a <i>demographic burden</i> to the economic growth (<a href=\"#bib23\">Van Der Gaag and Beer, 2015</a>). Being aware of this problem the European Commission (<a href=\"#bib7\">European Commission, 2015</a>, p. 14) in the proposed European Agenda on Migration points that population ageing is expected to have a negative impact on economic growth, with implications also for the sustainability of European welfare systems. One of the potential factors mitigating the macroeconomic impact of ageing is migration, which is expected to <i>increasingly be an important way to enhance the sustainability of our welfare system and to ensure sustainable growth of the EU economy</i> (<a href=\"#bib7\">European Commission, 2015</a>, p. 14). Empirical research on increased migration after the EU enlargement in 2004, supports the expected positive macroeconomic impact of labour-related migration (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baas et al., 2010</a>).",

Since Parnes, MRM models are designed as a combination of an econometric model of the macroeconomic environment aimed to predict the demand for labour, with an additional, more detailed model predicting the structure of the labour force. For example, in the Skills forecast produced by CEDEFOP, the macroeconomic predictions of total employment are broken down by economic sectors and qualification levels (defined in terms of occupations). The supply side of the labour market is predicted by a stock-flow model (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cedefop, Eurofound, 2018</a>, p. 15).

Expansion demand for labour is a result of expansion or restriction of employment in that particular segment of the labour market. It can be positive (new jobs are appearing) or negative (existing jobs are diminishing) and is mostly driven by macroeconomic and structural factors. It is therefore usually modelled by a macroeconomic model. Replacement demand appears when an existing job needs to be filled in because of a worker exiting the job (<a href=\"#bib4\">CEDEFOP, 2012</a>, p. 65). Several types of exits should be accounted for, exits to retirement, exits to other forms of economic inactivity, or mobility between labour market segments (the so-called churn-replacement). Replacement demand is mostly driven by individual factors, as it is strongly determined by age-related life situations.<sup><a href=\"#fn6\">6</a></sup>",

In line with this tradition, we have developed a model combining a macro-level prediction of employment trends, with micro-level information on the population of Slovakia. SLAMM is a dynamic microsimulation model designed to predict the development of the supply side of the Slovak labour market. After importing individual-level information about the Slovak population, it simulates the demographic processes, educational attainment, decisions related to economic activity and entering employment.",

Here changes in the aggregate number of employed within age cohorts are tracked in time to quantify the probability of exiting employment, therefore the need for replacement. In a dynamic microsimulation model, such as in the case of SLAMM, individual-level probabilities of particular types of exits are implemented in every period of the simulation. Among the types of exits (inactivity statuses), we identify: the retired, early retired,<sup><a href=\"#fn34\">34</a></sup> disabled, and other types of inactivity.<sup><a href=\"#fn35\">35</a></sup> Detailed disaggregation of the types of exits allows capturing different dynamics related to various sub-groups of interest; it thus allows producing more detailed predictions, enabling straightforward interpretation of the expected trends.",

In the same model, while working with sub-populations of particular interest (e.g. disabled or the working retired), age-specific proportions and probabilities are extracted out of a less recent, but more detailed CENSUS.

From the perspective of assuring available labour force through immigration policy, prolonging the length of stay should be prioritised over adjusting the age structure of immigrants. The output of the model allows considering further implications, for example, for social security or pension systems. For the sake of brevity, we do not explore these alleys here. Instead, we try to document the connection of replacement demand for labour and the number of inflowing foreign workers. Such connection can be observed empirically on aggregate figures (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) or assumed while designing a microsimulation model.
