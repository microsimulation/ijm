In 1976 he took up a chair in Statistics at the University of Gothenburg and in 1985 he got a personal chair in Econometrics at the Swedish Council for Humanities and Social Science Research, first located at the University of Gothenburg and later at the University of Uppsala.

Survey research has featured prominently in his research agenda. He started the first and only longitudinal household survey (HUS) in Sweden and he was Swedish country team leader of the European SHARE/AMANDA project (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe). Coming from a statistical and econometric background, he contributed to the growing field of microsimulation modelling touching upon the most pressing methodological and applied questions: from data issues, to behavioural modelling and statistical inference.",
