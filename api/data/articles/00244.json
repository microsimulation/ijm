Anders is an important figure in microsimulation modelling, having made key contributions over a period of more than four decades.

He was appointed docent in Statistics in 1972 and in Economics in 1983. In 1976 he took up a chair in Statistics at the University of Gothenburg and in 1985 he got a personal chair in Econometrics at the Swedish Council for Humanities and Social Science Research, first located at the University of Gothenburg and later at the University of Uppsala. He is currently emeritus from the University of Uppsala, having also been visiting professor/scholar at the University of Georgia and at ISR, the University of Michigan.",

Survey research has featured prominently in his research agenda. He started the first and only longitudinal household survey (HUS) in Sweden and he was Swedish country team leader of the European SHARE/AMANDA project (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe). Coming from a statistical and econometric background, he contributed to the growing field of microsimulation modelling touching upon the most pressing methodological and applied questions: from data issues, to behavioural modelling and statistical inference.",
