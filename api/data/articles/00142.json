                    "text": "Research on private wealth accumulation and concentration has recently received more prominence (see e.g. <a href=\"#bib19\">J\u00e4ntti, Sierminska, &amp; Smeeding, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Piketty &amp; Saez, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Piketty, 2014</a>). Various publications have pointed towards increased income inequality over the past decades in many OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, thdereby also devoting attention to the role played by wealth (see e.g. <a href=\"#bib27\">OECD, 2015</a>). In this context the need for more comprehensive and integrated data on individual well-being is widely recognised, as for example highlighted in the Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress (<a href=\"#bib33\">Stiglitz, Sen, &amp; Fitoussi, 2009</a>). For the component of wealth new household surveys as those developed as part of the Luxembourg Wealth Study (<a href=\"#bib20\">J\u00e4ntti, Sierminska, &amp; Van Kerm, 2013</a>) and the <a href=\"#bib11\">Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Network (HFCN) (HFCN, 2013a)</a> represent a milestone in this ongoing process for better measurement. These databases can also be the corner stone for the analysis of policies that have been put forward as a way to reduce inequality, such as wealth and property taxation (e.g. <a href=\"#bib28\">Piketty, 2014</a>). For this purpose it is important to assess the role of the different wealth components across countries, in order to set appropriate tax-free allowances and concentrate the tax burden on the wealthy part of the population, given the increasing role of housing assets in the household's portfolio along the entire income distribution (<a href=\"#bib13\">Figari, 2013</a>). Furthermore, defining living standards in terms of income and wealth (e.g. <a href=\"#bib3\">Azpitarte, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brandolini, Magri, &amp; Smeeding, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gornick, Sierminska, &amp; Smeeding, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Haveman &amp; Wolff, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kuypers &amp; Marx, 2016</a>), opens up new perspectives on social policy. In light of current budgetary restrictions social benefits could be focussed on those who are most precarious, i.e. using the joint distribution of income and wealth as a means-testing tool (e.g. <a href=\"#bib26\">Menon, Perali, &amp; Sierminska, 2016</a>). Moreover, the framework allows for new policies to be introduced that focus on asset building among the poor (<a href=\"#bib25\">McKernan &amp; Sherraden, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Shapiro &amp; Wolff, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Sherraden, 1991</a>).",

The HFCS is a dataset covering detailed household wealth, gross income and consumption information (<a href=\"#bib11\">HFCN, 2013a</a>), and thus provides more information on wealth than the current database underlying EUROMOD, which is the European Survey of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), the standard database for poverty and inequality research in the European Union (EU). Both databases have their weaknesses and strengths and should be regarded as complements. Incorporating the HFCS data in EUROMOD will enhance empirical research possibilities in many ways. First, it will allow analysing the joint distribution of disposable income and net wealth based on information from the same survey, potentially comparable across countries and time. As the HFCS contains only gross income amounts which are not suitable for distributive analysis, we derive net incomes by simulating the gross-to-net transition with EUROMOD taking into account all important details of the social security and personal income tax system. Second, policy analysis will be enhanced in different ways, as the policy domains currently covered in EUROMOD will be expanded with dimensions like wealth taxation and asset building incentives, which recently gained much interest in the academic and the public debate. In addition, the model based on HFCS data would allow for an integrated assessment of taxable capacity taking into account direct taxes on income and wealth and tackling challenging issues such as those faced by \u2018asset rich/income poor\u2019 households (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hills, 2013</a>). Moreover, it would enable to estimate the impact of reforms in wealth policies in interaction with other tax-benefit policies.",

In <a href=\"#s3\">Section 3</a> we discuss the assumptions and transformations needed to construct a EUROMOD database on the basis of the HFCS data. Belgium and Italy are used as a case study (<a href=\"#s4\">Section 4</a>). <a href=\"#s5\">Section 5</a> then studies the results of the derivation of net incomes for the HFCS data and validates them against those based on the current underlying database, EU-SILC.

Unlike a macroeconomic model, a microsimulation model allows one to simulate individual decision units. These decision units are typically households and the individuals that live in them. As described in <a href=\"#bib15\">Figari <i>et al</i>. (2015)</a> different types of analysis are facilitated by using a microsimulation approach, among else the impact of tax-benefit policy changes (e.g. reforms regarding wealth and income taxation) on income-based indicators and related statistics and the impact of demographic factors on disposable income through the effects of tax-benefit policies (e.g. due to the presence of children). In order to exploit the cross-country dimension of the HFCS data, it is quite natural to build a database from the HFCS for EUROMOD, the EU-wide tax-benefit model, rather than for separate national tax-benefit models. EUROMOD simulates cash benefit entitlements and direct tax and social insurance contribution liabilities on the basis of the tax-benefit rules in place and information available in the underlying datasets for all EU countries. Instruments which are not simulated (mainly contributory pensions), as well as market income, are taken directly from the data (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sutherland &amp; Figari, 2013</a>). As such, EUROMOD is of value in terms of assessing the first order effects of tax-benefit policies and in understanding how policy reforms may affect income distribution, work incentives and government budgets in the short term. Moreover, EUROMOD is built in a way that maximises its flexibility and possibility to simulate tax-benefit policies on different databases.",

The first purpose of running EUROMOD on the HFCS data is to derive a proper measure of disposable income, as the HFCS contains only gross income amounts which are not suitable for distributive analysis. This allows us to consider the joint distribution of disposable income and net wealth based on information coming from the same survey, potentially comparable across countries and time. Incorporating the HFCS data will allow expanding the policy domains currently covered in EUROMOD with dimensions like wealth taxation and asset building incentives; this is the second purpose of our study. This expansion will among others enable simulations relating to issues like a tax shift from income to wealth. It will help to understand and measure the redistributive role of these policies, also in relation to the other tax-benefit rules. Moreover, with subsequent waves of the HFCS coming available, the microsimulation model will also enable to investigate changes over time and to determine to what extent these are due to changes in the underlying population or to changes in the policies.",

For most countries, the sample size is large enough although it might not be exploited to conduct analysis on small groups in some countries (it might be too small for Slovenia with 340 households; in the other countries the sample size of the first wave ranges from 843 households in Malta to 15,006 in France). Survey weights take into account the units probability of selection, coverage issues, unit non-response and an adjustment of weights to external data (calibration) (<a href=\"#bib11\">HFCN, 2013a</a>). An interesting feature of the HFCS dataset is that in most countries the very wealthy are oversampled such that a better coverage of the top of the income and wealth distributions is obtained. This is necessary because there exist large sampling and non-sampling errors as a consequence of the strong skewness of the wealth distribution. In particular the wealthiest households are less likely to respond and more likely to underreport, especially in the case of financial assets (<a href=\"#bib7\">Davies, Sandstr\u00f6m, Shorrocks, &amp; Wolff, 2011</a>). Hence, in contrast to the EU-SILC sampling design which focuses on the households at the bottom of the income distribution, the HFCS focuses on the top (<a href=\"#bib11\">HFCN, 2013a</a>, pp. 98\u201399). Since taxes typically have a larger impact on the top of the distribution the implementation of the HFCS in EUROMOD should lead to more accurate outcomes on the distributional and budgetary effects of taxation. The <a href=\"#bib12\">HFCN (2013b</a>, p. 21) indicates that this oversampling strategy in some countries comes at the expense of coverage at the bottom of the distribution, but it is not clear to what extent this is the case in practice. Consequently, the benefit side of the redistributive system may still be better covered by EU-SILC.",

More specifically, the HFCS gross income concept includes the following components: employee income, self-employment income, rental income from real estate property, income from financial investments, income from pensions (public, occupational &amp; private), regular social transfers, regular private transfers, income from private businesses and income from other sources (<a href=\"#bib12\">HFCN, 2013b</a>, p. 108). The major differences with the income concept of EU-SILC are presented in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>. First, it is clear that in the category of employee income the HFCS only asks respondents about cash and near cash income, while EU-SILC also captures non-cash income. Secondly, pensions from mandatory employer-based schemes are included in public pensions in EU-SILC, while they are covered under private pensions in the HFCS (<a href=\"#bib11\">HFCN, 2013a</a>, p. 100). Finally, income received by people under 16 is only covered in EU-SILC.

Overall, the composition is largely similar between HFCS and EU-SILC and also compared to the figures of the external source. For Belgium the HFCS appears to slightly overestimate the share of highly educated individuals. Since education is strongly correlated with income and wealth accumulation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Juster, Smith, &amp; Stafford, 1999</a>), this is likely due to the oversampling of the wealthy in the HFCS. Hence, the population weights do not seem to correct entirely for this overrepresentation in the sample.

The distributions of disposable income follow a similar pattern: median and mean income are lower in HFCS than in EU-SILC for Italy, while for Belgian disposable incomes, the medians are similar according to both datasets, while mean disposable incomes are higher according to HFCS. The comparison of the Gini coefficient shows very similar outcomes according to HFCS and EU-SILC for Italy. For Belgium, however, inequality indices are very different, with much higher inequality according to the HFCS data.

Therefore, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> shows average disposable incomes according to EM-HFCS and EM-SILC over income deciles for Belgium (see Annex: <a href=\"#tableA3\">Table A.3</a> and <a href=\"#tableA4\">Table A4</a> for Italy). It is clear that the difference in inequality is mainly driven by divergence at the top and the bottom of the income distribution. While the average equivalised disposable income in the 10th decile is equal to \u20ac 57,618 based on the HFCS, it is only \u20ac 37,832 for EU-SILC. The difference in average disposable income in the bottom decile is approximately 33% higher in EU-SILC than in the HFCS. <a href=\"#bib24\">Kuypers <i>et al</i>. (2015)</a> show that despite their methodological similarities, distributional differences between HFCS and EU-SILC already exist at the gross income level. Moreover, differences are mainly found with regard to taxes and social insurance contributions, which are typically based on the income level, while outcomes for the benefits received are much more similar as eligibility is often based on non-monetary aspects such as the presence of children in order to qualify for child benefits. Hence, we attribute the difference in outcomes between the two surveys mainly to the HFCS oversampling strategy. <a href=\"#bib22\">Kennickell (2008)</a> and <a href=\"#bib4\">Bover (2008)</a> argue that on top of its correction for nonresponse, oversampling of the wealthy also provides more precise estimates of wealth in general and of narrowly held assets as standard errors are much smaller. Since oversampling in the Belgian HFCS data is based on average income by neighbourhood of residence (<a href=\"#bib11\">HFCN, 2013a</a>), it also results in more accurate estimates of the top of the income distribution as well as of income sources that are typically received by a select group. Since what happens at the top of the distribution largely drives inequality trends (see <a href=\"#bib1\">Alvaredo, Atkinson, Piketty, &amp; Saez, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Piketty, 2014</a>), we expect the HFCS to capture the level of inequality more closely to reality than EU-SILC. <a href=\"#bib36\">Vermeulen (2014)</a>, however, shows that despite the oversampling strategy wealth shares of the top 5% and 1% are still underestimated. It is not clear whether this is also the case for the income distribution. A comparison of HFCS and EU-SILC with official tax statistics (see Annex: <a href=\"#tableA5\">Table A.5</a>) suggests that EU-SILC underestimates the number of tax units and mean net taxable income at the top of the income distribution, while the HFCS appears to overestimate it.",

We provide two illustrations of possible analyses. First, we consider the joint distribution of income and wealth according to quartiles. This may help to shed light to what extent income and wealth inequalities are jointly determined and interact with one another (see <a href=\"#bib27\">OECD (2015)</a> for an example of the United States). <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> shows the distribution according to income and wealth quartiles for the two countries. In the case of a perfect correlation, the options \u201811\u2019, \u201822\u2019, \u201833\u2019 and \u201844\u2019 should correspond to 25% each. This is, however, not the case, showing that there is considerable reranking of tax units if one would move from one distribution to the other. For instance, in both countries less than half of the tax units of the first income quartile are located in the bottom wealth quartile; a similar pattern is found for the top quartile. Nevertheless, the rank correlation between disposable income and net wealth at household level is positive (Spearman's rank correlation of 0.44 in Belgium and 0.62 in Italy), as one would expect given that higher wealth in general generates higher capital income. But given that the correlation is far from perfect, these outcomes illustrate that apart from income there are other drivers of wealth inequality that play an important role (e.g. gifts, inheritances, capital gains, etc.; see also <a href=\"#bib28\">Piketty, 2014</a>).",

It is important to look at the full distribution, as our outcomes show that there are some discrepancies at the bottom and especially at the top of the distribution.

The oversampling of wealthy households might result in more accurate estimates of income and wealth at the top, although other potential reasons for the discrepancies should be investigated in more depth. These outcomes also provide an indication of the complementarity of both HFCS and EU-SILC; while EU-SILC is probably more suitable for research questions relating to the bottom of the income distribution, HFCS is probably more accurate for research focusing on the top.
