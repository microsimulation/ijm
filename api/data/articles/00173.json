To answer such questions, complex high dimensional, agent-based and difficult to estimate models are needed. This soon takes the economist outside the range of mathematics s/he is comfortable with. Such was, however, the ambition of the Swedish micro firm to macroeconomic systems modelling project presented in this essay, initiated almost 45 years ago. This model is presented as a Reference model for theoretical and empirical studies, with the ambition to understand the roles of the \u201cbirth, life and death\u201d of business agents in the evolution of a self-coordinated market economy, without the help of a Walrasian central planner. Mathematical simulation is argued to be the effective tool for such theoretical and empirical analyses. Four problems have been chosen that demand a model of the Reference type to address, and that the Reference model has been used to address. They are (1) exploring the interior structures of the model for surprise analytical outcomes not previously observed, or thought of; (2) quantifying the long-term costs and benefits of large structure changing micro-interventions in the economy; (3) studying long-term historical economic systems evolutions, and asking what could have happened alternatively, if the historic evolution would have originated differently, and (4) generalizing from case observations.",

Orcutt\u2019s disapproved of the erroneous assumptions underlying macro modelling. Only under extreme and unworldly assumptions about \u201celemental decision-making units\u201d would macro relationships be theoretically acceptable, but those aggregates meant \u201ca disastrous loss of accuracy of representation\u201d. Klevmarken (<a href=\"#bib96\">1978</a>, <a href=\"#bib97\">1983</a>) also regretted the unnecessary loss of available microinformation that came with aggregation for macro modelling, and that simulation experiments on the Swedish agent-based macroeconomic model, referred to as the \u201cReference model\u201d in what follows (<a href=\"#s2\">Section 2</a>), already at that time had obviated. This critique was reiterated in the 1977 Stockholm microsimulation conference, perhaps the first ever, where Bergmann, Eliasson, and <a href=\"#bib112\">Orcutt (1980)</a> stated \u201cthat a criterion of good theory in economics can only be how well-grounded in relevant, empirical facts it is\u201d (op. cit. p. 12), and the obvious fact is that economic agents such as individuals, households and business firms are different, and that the role of this heterogeneity should be recognized in good modelling. On this <a href=\"#bib27\">Citro &amp; Hanushek (1997)</a> argued that sufficient knowledge of micro unit behaviour (in their case households) was not yet available for accurate specification of Micro based Macro systems models.

The modeller therefore often chooses to simplify the model, and instead faces the perhaps even more serious problem of mis-specification. With sufficient data and enormous future computer capacity the estimation problems of complex, selection based and non-linear models should, however, in principle be solvable. A richly parameterised model would therefore be the right reference for empirically credible and open-minded theorising (see <a href=\"#s5\">Section 5</a> on Surprise Economics). Then, there would be no need for macro models at all, since the process of aggregating behaviour in markets would be endogenised within the micro-based model, and aggregation would be reduced to summing up the outputs at the end. There would even be reasons to expect that most macroeconomic relationships would not be compatible with the inherent relationships of an empirically well-grounded micro-based economic systems model (see <a href=\"#s3\">Section 3</a>). However, the ambition of empirical credibility may still be out of reach as of today, implying a need to state objectively how to make empirical sense of less than perfectly calibrated complex models (<a href=\"#bib64\">Eliasson, 2016</a>, <a href=\"#bib65\">2017a</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Hansen &amp; Heckman, 1996</a>).",

While the birth, the life and the death of individuals concern well-defined entities, the life of business firms is that of constant structural transformation through mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. And indeed, demand for a better understanding of the nature and roles played by business firms in long-term economic development was the chief reason for initiating the project that led up to the Reference model of this essay (<a href=\"#s2\">Section 2</a>). Likewise, early on questions were asked about the economy-wide, long-term consequences of micro-interventions in the economy, and prompted the quantitative inquiry into the Swedish industrial support program of the 1970s and 1980s, that was based on the Reference model (<a href=\"#s6\">Section 6</a>). In a historical perspective, seemingly minor occurrences in the distant past, like a clustering of successful entrepreneurial activities, or the establishment of a new institution that improved the allocative performance of markets, may have nudged the entire economic system onto a different historical trajectory than it would otherwise have taken (<a href=\"#s7\">Section 7</a>). The Reference model described in the next section (<a href=\"#s2\">Section 2</a>) has been found to be appropriate for the quantitative study of the economic systems consequences such very long-term courses of irreversible events between consequences and such.",

These growth dynamics involve integrating familiar, often trivially true principles of economics. I conclude below that understanding such economic systems dynamics is not possible without understanding that market-based integration, and to do that mathematical simulation is the appropriate analytical tool. Even though simulation is a concept that has been subject to a large philosophical literature as computers have become increasingly capable (<a href=\"#bib79\">Fontana, 2006</a>), for me mathematical simulation is a branch of mathematics that is particularly suitable for addressing complex theoretical and empirical economic systems problems.",

How should aggregation over markets of micro behaviour be made a natural part of total economic systems dynamics? How intellectually restrictive is the economist\u2019s standard mathematical toolbox, the calculus of optimisation? What analytical potential does simulation mathematics offer in enhancing the understanding of economic behaviour? How can existing, often diverse and taxonomically incompatible microdata be combined for maximum information access? Perhaps most important of all: what usefulness is added by those complex, analytically non-transparent and difficult to estimate micro-based economic systems models when there are so many analytically transparent and familiar partial models, the parameters of which can be readily estimated?",

Some 40 years ago, however, mass unemployment caused by the then new micro-electronics technologies worried even famous economists (<a href=\"#bib101\">Leontief, 1982</a>). Since the workers destroyed the textile machines during the early industrial revolution, every half-century or so has seen technological unemployment return for debate. Since \u201cjob destruction\u201d and \u201cnew job creation\u201d usually occur in different industries, at different places and with a time lag, compared to the firms laying off workers because of technological advance, narrowly defined partial and static sector or macro models have little to tell on this issue. The first serious use of the Reference model occurred when the Swedish Government Committee on Computers and Electronics (DEK) asked the Industrial Institute for Economic and Social Research (IUI, now IFN), of which I had just become the director, to calculate the economy-wide long-term employment consequences under different labour market regimes, of the introduction of new microelectronic technologies (<a href=\"#bib42\">Eliasson, 1979</a>). The conclusion was that technologically laid off labour would soon be employed elsewhere, and the socially by far most costly policy (in terms of lost output) was to prevent the introduction of new technologies and/or delay the immediate unemployment effects caused by them.",

From the beginning in 1974 the Reference model also had a dominant theoretical orientation with a strong, but novel basis in traditional economic principles. The focus was on the complex economic systems consequences of the integration of those principles, which were studied numerically using simulation mathematics. The unique dynamic properties of the Reference model originate in the integration of Schumpeterian entrepreneurial economics with the dynamics of sequential feedback of the Wicksellian/Stockholm School emphasising the difference between <i>ex ante</i> plans and <i>ex post</i> outcomes, Keynesian demand feedback of all income (wages and profits) conveyed to the household sector and taxes collected by the public sector, with a touch of Kaldorian technical change.

I was at the time involved in a study on economic planning and budgeting in large western companies (published as <a href=\"#bib37\">Eliasson, 1976a</a>) and had a pretty good idea of how to structure a model of firm decision making. My condition for engaging in such an academic modelling venture was that the model be micro firm based, explicitly representing aggregation in markets up to the macro level, and be capable of portraying the dynamics of an evolving capitalist market economy. IBM took me around the academic world to check up on what was going on in the field, visits notably reaching out from IBM\u2019s own research centres with a social science orientation in San Jose (USA), Pisa (Italy), and Peterlee (England). One desideratum was that the model venture should not be a replication of something already achieved. There was a general agreement that this was an obvious novel approach to take. The study trips confirmed that there was no such project, excepting Barbara Bergmann\u2019s Transactions Model of the US economy, in the research pipeline at the time. I am particularly grateful to Kenneth Arrow who helped me to get in contact with unorthodox economists in the US. Those contacts led me to Barbara Bergmann and Guy Orcutt in particular, but also to several heretic theoretical economists, among them Richard Day, Harvey Leibenstein, Herbert Simon and Sidney Winter. <a href=\"#bib133\">Winter (1964)</a> was especially supporting in my ambition to begin building an economy wide systems model from a micro firm platform, and with a Darwinian orientation.",

For several years, IUI had three economy wide models up and running; the Reference model, one highly aggregated monetary model and a Keynes &amp; Leontief sectoral model. Since the two last models could be derived as special cases of the Reference model by aggregating up to sector levels and shutting down all the Stockholm School <i>ex ante</i> plans <i>ex post</i> outcomes dynamics, it was interesting for the long-term analysis of the Swedish economy published in 1979 (<a href=\"#bib88\">IUI, 1979</a>) to ask the same questions to all three models and then identify the reasons for the different answers.",

While the Reference model economy was difficult to control through available policy parameters, simulating the other two models conveyed the illusion of being in full control of the economy. Thus, for instance, pushing the Reference model economy too fast, and too far to lower unemployment, soon began to disturb the market coordination of production and investment, and resulted in worse countervailing labour market disturbances.",

The database work for the model, notably the Planning Survey and the complete stock and flow consistent micro-based National Accounts statistics put together for one initial year, that is 1982 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albrecht <i>et al</i>., 1992</a>), furthermore, has been found useful in other unrelated research projects. <a href=\"#bib13\">Bergholm (1985)</a> simulated the pull effects of the small number of very large and dominant engineering firms on the Swedish economy, and its exposure to possible negative market experiences of some of these firms. Dan Johansson used the model in his doctorate thesis 2001 at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), which was in part a study on the exposure of the Swedish economy to information and communications technologies for the Swedish Agency for Civilian Emergency Planning. In return a new firm based computer and communications (C&amp;C) industry was introduced in the model (see <a href=\"#bib70\">Eliasson &amp; Johansson, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Johansson, 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib90\">2005</a>). Most important, however, is the capacity of theoretical reasoning offered by the Reference model. The discussion in <a href=\"#s4\">Section 4</a> illustrates that complex high dimensional models of the Reference model type constantly come up with surprise phenomena that have not before been observed, but that may occur suddenly, that cannot be derived from within the confined neoclassical structures, or ideas about what may have happened that you may go and look for. My conceptualisation of an \u201cExperimentally Organized Economy\u201d dawned upon me during repeated simulation studies on the model, and its foundation in Stockholm School <i>ex ante</i> plans, <i>ex post</i> outcomes analysis, featuring the prevalence of more or less mistaken decisions at the micro-level, and the general ignorance of economic actors of circumstances that may challenge their very economic existence (<a href=\"#bib50\">Eliasson, 1987</a>, <a href=\"#bib63\">2015</a>). Since an eleven sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and a Leontief &amp; Keynesian (L&amp;K) model can be demonstrated (see below) to be special cases of the Reference model, any user of that model can easily relate to those more familiar models, and identify and evaluate the origin of unfamiliar surprise outcomes.",

This essay can be seen as an argument against the latter, and for the need of the former to address a number of urgent social economic problems credibly, for instance the four examples in this document. I will also make the point that simulation is a highly sophisticated mathematical tool that today makes it unnecessary to hold on to wrongly specified models to be able to use the old toolbox of economists. The Eurace@Unibi model appears to be of the new complex agent-based kind that I advocate (see for instance <a href=\"#bib31\">Dawid, Harting, Van der Hoog, &amp; Neugart, 2016</a>), that also incorporates many features of the original Reference model.",

Macro output so defined and empirically represented will then be a measure of something you desire to see, for instance a welfare index, or a quantification of available resources in an economy. When the micro foundations of heterogeneous, ignorant and behaving agents have been properly modelled and the final outputs summed up, there is no need for a separate macro theory. A separate macro theory may be needed if the micro foundations have been badly understood and erroneously represented, which <a href=\"#bib27\">Citro &amp; Hanushek (1997)</a> argued (from their experience with household data) would long be the case.

As many of the behaviours originally featured by the Reference model have been subsequently observed, and have been patched onto standard macro models as ad hoc and rarely consistent postfixes, it is legitimate to ask whether these early analytical conjectures could have served as signals of what to go and look for, without the need to learn it the hard way. One problem might have been the empirical credibility of the calibrated parameters of the complex model, and hence the relevance of those \u201ctheoretical\u201d results. But using falsely specified, but perfectly estimated models is worse, since then you cannot use your model to identify the reasons for this or that conjecture. Given an assessment of the overall empirical credibility of the model, such conjectures might therefore serve well as warnings of what may come, to be taken as seriously as a common sense appreciation would tell. They could also help empirical researchers to go out to look for new empirical evidence.

Mathematically, the selection based and highly non-linear Reference model simply cannot be solved for such an exogenous equilibrium.

The credibility objection is in principle more relevant, but credibility is associated with how carefully conducted the study is, again a matter of costs. The study itself may also carry extra social value. Even though an agreement has not been reached on the empirical credibility of the estimated parameters, which impinge on the results obtained, specifying a relevant cost benefit model and designing a proper study of a large project require that the entire project design and implementation is thoroughly thought through.

All the endogenous dynamics needed to simulate the economy wide long-term structure changing allocational effects were included. However, the parameters were calibrated in a rather primitive way. Thus the Reference model could provide quantitative answers in great detail to practically all sorts of questions, but their empirical credibility rested squarely on the calibrated parameters, and notably on the dozen parameters that regulated the sequential market feedback of mistaken firm decisions.

Using a more traditional model of the CGE type or a sector L&amp;K model (several of those were made available about a decade after our study, and frequently used to address similar cost benefit problems) would however have been wrong because of misspecification, even though no one might have objected to the estimated parameters. Using such models would have meant doing away with an almost perfect micro defined policy interface, assuming away important dynamic market feedbacks (less so in a L&amp;K sector model with Keynesian macro demand feedbacks), and eliminating by assumption all the dynamic resource reallocation effects, which in this case were negative, and large.

The main results of the <a href=\"#bib26\">Carlsson <i>et al</i>.

An interesting \u201ccorollary conclusion\u201d however is that when the industrial support program was terminated, and replaced by a radically different and pro-market oriented policy agenda in 1993, the manufacturing output lost during two decades of earlier stagnation compared to the OECD average, and apparently caused by the industrial subsidy program. Swedish manufacturing swiftly responded through improved resource reallocations, and caught up with the OECD average in a few years (<a href=\"#bib65\">Eliasson, 2017a</a>). This outcome is in keeping with the behaviour of the Reference model economy as it had responded in the alternative policies simulated for the Government Committee, the most effective policy alternative being to allow the firms in distress to die fast and support the economy at large with an equally large (as the support program) general reduction of the payroll tax.

Such innovative contracting (<a href=\"#bib65\">Eliasson, 2017a</a>) requires a very competent public customer, and an equally clever supplier. How to evaluate spillovers effects becomes crucial. An economic adviser to the government might argue that if the supplier would obtain a decent private return on its investment that should be enough. However, this would be an incorrect way of formulating the decision problem of the government, because if the purchase went to a foreign supplier, Sweden would have been deprived of the spillover benefits that were not understood at the time, but that have later been calculated to be significant.<sup><a href=\"#fn26\">26</a></sup> In fact, it should have been a concern of the public customer (if sufficiently competent to understand it) to set up a spillover study on its own to evaluate what the country and it citizens would get for their money (the Gripens, plus the spillovers) in the alternatives considered. Similarly, the supplier should have been even more concerned to make the external benefits (the spillovers) statistically visible to the public customer; first of all not to miss the procurement, but also to negotiate a better margin. Perhaps the government should obtain a share in the spillovers created, which was not the case with the Gripen procurement.<sup><a href=\"#fn27\">27</a></sup> Ironically, however, at the time of the Gripen decision, the Reference model was up and running, and was already being used to calculate the economy wide costs and benefits of the enormous industrial subsidy program mentioned above.

Spillover cases were identified and gross spillover values calculated. The database of the Reference model was used to determine opportunity costs manually approximating the endogenous market adjustments occurring in the Reference model.

Above all, however, since the Reference model explicitly integrates the case study method with an economy wide dynamic agent-based model (see <a href=\"#s8\">Section 8</a> on generalising from case studies) it could be used to explicitly relate the case study results to estimates obtained in a large number of econometric spillover studies based on macro or sector models.

Depending on the initial conditions (a problem of historic measurement), and the parameters of the model that guide the historic evolution (a matter of relevant specification and estimation), something entirely different might have occurred.

How should the very long time and bad future consequences of bad policy choices today, that can be discounted away (the political discount rate), be compared with the distress experienced by later generations, when the bad future has materialised? Evolutionary, micro-based economic systems models that are empirically well founded exhibit these properties. None of these historical questions furthermore can be meaningfully raised without the explicit context of such a model. Even though a tall order for the economic historian, complementing the analysis of <i>ex post</i> facts with simulated alternative economic histories should amplify the empirical credibility of the historical analysis. The Reference model of this article can simulate such alternative trajectories in great detail, and their long-term evolution is not, as in neoclassical growth models, governed by an exogenously imposed (assumed) equilibrium trend.<sup><a href=\"#fn30\">30</a></sup> Should we engage in such number crunching?

Hence, the simulation of alternative histories should be based on models that feature the cumulative importance of such historic choices. For instance, why have some regions, or entire economies, failed to be industrialised, while others have grown successfully for centuries, only to sometimes suddenly collapse and retard into a less advanced state? Literature abounds with alternative historical speculations of historical development, and models of the Reference type would allow evaluating these speculations in a logically consistent way.

Moreover, even when policy makers think they know, correcting the situation through policy may take more time than the political horizon: having a Reference model can help extending such a political horizon. However, forecasts to guide the model economy onto a desired long-term growth path may be impossible because of the immense number of future paths the model economy can take, the near impossibility to simulating them all to make an informed policy choice, and (above all) the bad empirical control of the calibrated parameters. This implies large risks of substantial policy mistakes, if a particular simulated forecast is taken seriously. Device policies that work \u201con average\u201d will not solve that dilemma.

For each of them it is possible to trace <i>ex post</i> and in great detail, as economic historians do, their origin and the details of the historic path the economic system has taken. While trying to police the model economy towards desired long-term outcomes is both futile, and involves significant risk of taking the economy in the wrong direction, trying to avoid bad future outcomes by steering around circumstances that create them makes more sense. In principle, it is possible to explore by simulation a large portion of the near term interior of the economic opportunities space of the model<sup><a href=\"#fn31\">31</a></sup>, and to determine circumstantial risk zones that policy makers should try to stay out of to prevent bad long-term outcomes. However, how much credibility should be attached to those calculated risk zones is again a matter of empirical credibility of the model used: (1) its prior specification, (2) the empirical credibility of its parameterisation, on which it might not be possible to reach consensus, and (3), not least important, the quality of measurement of initial conditions. On all three counts policy makers will have to apply both common sense and sound judgement. This second use of the model to help device risk reduction policies, as distinct from forecasting, should however require less in the form of empirically accurate parameterisation. The risk of missing a specific predicted policy target because of errors in parameters, must be larger than that of misguiding the economy with the help of the same model around a simulated undesired event. An analogy could be trying to bring an old car with a loose steering, driven at high speed on a narrow and winding road, to a simulated (\u201cpredicted\u201d) Nirvana.

Such generalisation is commonly practiced in business decision making in that decisions simply have to be taken on scant and unreliable evidence long before the environmental circumstances are understood, to prevent the business from being overrun by competitors that have taken the right decisions faster. Experience and observations are then filtered into an \u201cintuitively understood\u201d decision model of an individual, a group of individuals, or a firm (a \u201ccompetent team\u201d) based on the ad hoc experiences of business decision makers. <a href=\"#bib99\">Knight (1921)</a> made a rational case for such behaviour in arguing that the business decision maker used his own decision model, however conceived, to turn genuine uncertainty into subjectively calculable risks (<a href=\"#bib51\">Eliasson, 1990</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">1992</a>, <a href=\"#bib58\">2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">LeRoy &amp; Singell, 1987</a>). This behaviour can also be demonstrated to be rational in the Reference model, both for the business decision maker, and socially, because (1) innovative entrepreneurial decisions by definition cannot be objectively founded, and (2) that if intuitively well-grounded decisions are delayed on the belief that they will be better understood when more evidence has been collected, they may still be both misunderstood, and taken too late. Since (3) entrepreneurial ventures both succeed and fail, an interesting question is whether the expected outcomes are positive, and whether the business failures can be regarded as a necessary cost to incur for economic development to occur (<a href=\"#bib68\">Eliasson &amp; Eliasson, 2005</a>). A corollary question is under what institutional circumstances a free experimental trial and error process will have a positive long run outcome in expectation. On this <a href=\"#bib4\">Antonov &amp; Trofimov (1993)</a> demonstrated on the Reference model that forcing all agents in the model economy onto a centralised planning mode (a \u201ccentralised forecast\u201d) was not the optimal policy in the evolutionary and unpredictable economic environment of the Reference model, with constantly changing and unpredictable structures. Allowing each agent to form individually conceived views of the future, and designing their business experiments accordingly, meant that agents stumbled onto successful innovative action that would have gone missing for ever in the irreversible evolutionary environment of the Reference model.<sup><a href=\"#fn32\">32</a></sup> The number of failed business experiments increased as well as firm exits, but the long run macro growth outcome was larger than in the centrally mandated policy experiments. This better long run outcome was thus achieved at the social cost of more mistaken business decisions (firm exits), a result repeated on a later version of the Reference model in <a href=\"#bib72\">Eliasson <i>et al</i>. (2005)</a>. Paradoxically, therefore, even grossly ignorant agent decisions may together coordinate the entire Reference model economy towards a long-term outcome that is better than what a central planner or Walrasian auctioneer can achieve. The reason is that the information base for centrally guiding the Reference model successfully (even knowing its code), on the basis of data generated by the model, to an optimal and better outcome does not exist. This result derives directly from the Wicksellian/Stockholm School features of the model. In the Reference model, firms make their own autonomous decisions, discovering opportunities which the policy maker or central planner, relying on the limited or distorted information available at central levels, cannot see, or which the central planner, by imposing its decisions, can prevent them from exploiting. The theoretical conjecture is that the same thing might also occur in a real economy, and the scientific conclusion is that you need a complex economy wide, dynamic and agent-based model of the Reference model type both to understand, demonstrate and explain it.",

Large political projects may however be tested on the Reference model under various assumptions for the policy maker to get a \u201cfeel for\u201d the possible outcomes, and then for bad and disastrous outcomes in particular.

A business manager would then be able to simulate the consequences for both his individual firm, and for the economy at large of particular actions under different assumptions of how other firms would react. One example of that was the widespread worry in 1975 of what the first \u201coil price crisis\u201d would do to both the economy and an individual firm, on which the model would have immediate and precise answers, even though it was used much too early for such an exercise (<a href=\"#bib65\">Eliasson 2017a, p. 295</a>). Preparations to use the Reference model for such interactive simulation experiments also began early. Two divisions of Volvo, represented in the model, were set up to be operated by Volvo staff. In the late 1970s, even large mainframe computers were however not capable to handle such games on the Reference model. When this management experiment was conducted at the IBM computer centre in Stockholm in the late 1970s three mainframe computers were needed, one each for running the Volvo divisions, and one for running the rest of the model, including the interaction with the division models (<a href=\"#bib49\">Eliasson, 1985, p. 151</a>).

Stochastic linear process models are still popular simulation devices, and the observational equivalence of data generated between a deterministic non-linear model, a macroeconomic linear stochastic process model and reality makes it difficult to distinguish statistically between them. This makes many feel at home with simple transparent models that can generate some stylised facts of reality. Why bother with complexity when transparent linear models tell the same thing? On this <a href=\"#bib32\">Day (1996, p. 400)</a> concludes with a resounding \u201cno\u201d. Linear stochastic macro models tell nothing about the underlying dynamics that has generated a stylised descriptive, for instance, macro outcome.
