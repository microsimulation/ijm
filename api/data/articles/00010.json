                "text": "Microsimulation based on income tax statistics may be useful in tax reform discussions. Unfortunately, access to appropriate data is still rather restricted and expensive for ad-hoc analyses, and individual data is often even not available at all. In this paper we take Germany and its data situation as a proxy for many countries. restrictions in terms of tax data availability. Analyzing how much reliability and robustness of results we lose if we employ group simulation instead of microsimulation, we compare both methods. Investigating tax scale effects by the group model leads to very good results. Determining the financial effects of modified tax bases, the deviation from the microsimulation results increases, especially if tax base cuts vary between taxpayers. In addition, we take account of the class of taxpayers with a negative taxable income. Neglecting this class we identify a systematic underestimation of the financial consequences of a modified tax base with the group model assuming a progressive tax scale. If the group simulation data is not arranged according to the taxable income, but rather according to the total amount of income, we also find a tendency towards higher deviations from the microsimulation results. Quantifying the tax revenue effects of alternative tax settings the group simulation model represents a good compromise between the desire to capture the complex reality and the achievable accuracy when facing limited resources and data. Furthermore, for those cases in which group simulation is the appropriate tool, we provide a very simple method to interpolate a suitable income distribution and thereby the tax distribution within the classes. This interpolation makes future estimates of tax revenues a lot easier. We conclude that, although microsimulation in general is the superior approach, a group simulation model remains of interest, especially for analyses of rather old data and cross-country analyses, when sufficiently detailed data for micro analyses is missing.",

The results may be useful in tax reform, budget and income distribution discussions and therefore may contribute substantially to solving these three major economic questions. As long as complete microdatasets are available microsimulation is the preferable tool. However, access to appropriate data in a number of countries is still rather restricted or expensive for <i>ad hoc</i> analyses. In addition, in the case of analyses based on data from previous assessment periods individual data are often not available at all. Even in the industrialized countries data collected earlier than 10 to 15 years ago is usually not microdata but grouped data. Consequently analyses of times series often have to fall back on group data. This is true even for industrialized countries where microsimulation models have become a widespread tool for the analysis of newly collected data. Hence, group simulation models often have to be applied for specific countries, for cross-country analyses and for long-term time series analyses. Against this backdrop it is important to find out how robust the results from group simulation are and thus how big is the error arising from the more aggregate group model in comparison to a microsimulation model. Conversely, given the expense and effort involved in setting up a microsimulation model, it is also important to consider under what circumstances sample-based microsimulation that uses incomplete microdatasets remains superior to group simulation.",

In contrast, for group simulation purposes an empirical frequency distribution has to be formally estimated from the available aggregated data by applying specific distribution functions.

If no acceptable mathematical approximation can be achieved we have to abstain from a theoretical approach to empirical income distribution and conduct an interpolation instead.

Widely used analytic approximations include the log-normal (e.g., <a href=\"#bib3\">Berglas, 1971</a>: 534) and Pareto distributions (e.g., <a href=\"#bib24\">Piketty and Saez, 2003</a>: 6; <a href=\"#bib27\">Saez and Veall, 2007</a>: 230). It is preferable, we argue, to deduce the income distribution directly from the available data. As data on the number of tax payers for each specific unit of taxable income <i>TI</i> is unavailable we need to interpolate. We derive the results presented in the following by applying a group simulation model and determining the distribution of income by means of a linear interpolation of the group simulation. An arithmetical series (i.e. a discrete function), rather than a continuous function, is chosen to approximate the distribution of income. Generating discrete income distribution functions is appropriate for tax revenue analysis since the domain of the income tax scale function contains only natural numbers and thus discrete arguments.<a href=\"#fn3\"><sup>3</sup></a> During the interpolation, the aggregate taxable income of all taxpayers in each tax class is also considered.",

This result is robust even if we analyze the splitting tax scale instead. The observable deviations, as expected, are much lower than the theoretically derived relative underestimation of the tax liability if we refer to the mid-point of the class. It is remarkable that the high quality of the group simulation results arise when comparing not only the total tax revenues but also in almost every single class. The sometimes substantial deviations found by other models in the lower and upper income classes (cf., e.g., <a href=\"#bib24\">Piketty and Saez, 2003</a>: 55, concerning the heterogeneity in the top income decile) are considerably reduced when we employ our discrete group simulation model. Moreover, the quality of the results of the discrete group simulation model is not dependent on the class limits chosen by the German Statistical Office. Even for simulations with tax scales whose basic tax-exempt amount does not correspond to the class limits set by the German Statistical Office, differences of similar structure and dimension occur, i.e. again very small deviations.",

Instead, in the following we focus on the problem of tax deductions from the tax assessment base (c.f. <a href=\"#bib19\">O\u2019Donoghue and Sutherland, 1999</a>: 576\u2013577). In order to measure the fiscal impact of these deductions, their tax revenue effects are determined by considering a corresponding increase in the tax base within the simulation. Our conclusions can in principle be transferred to tax regulations that lead to an increase of the tax base and their tax revenue effects by simulating an adequate tax base reduction.",

In order to improve the quality of the results of our group model, information about the distribution of the taxpayers enjoying this fixed tax privilege, as far as this information is available, should be considered explicitly in the simulation. From the published income tax statistics, as outlined already, the number of taxpayers and the total amount of fixed amount tax base deductions in thousands of deutschmarks per class is given. Therefore we have information about the distribution among different income classes, but not about the distribution of these amounts among the taxpayers within the classes. If the tables in the income tax statistics do not provide data on the taxable income of the taxpayers who benefit from this deduction, then for group simulation purposes we have to fall back on the sum of the taxable incomes of all taxpayers and hence, on the distribution of all taxpayers in this class derived from the group simulation.

The greatest relative difference is observed for class 1, which includes taxpayers with a taxable income less than one DM. Since this class is not further subdivided in the income tax statistics but covers a wide range of negative taxable incomes, here the group simulation model is highly inaccurate. As a consequence, estimating the number of taxpayers with positive income greater than the basic tax-exempt amount due to vertical loss offset restriction is rather unreliable. Besides, the results in this class depend on the lower class boundary which must be determined heuristically. Including the class of the taxpayers with a taxable income less than one DM is reasonable only for microsimulation of tax revenue effects if we want to analyze an increase in the tax base \u2013 as far as these taxpayers are affected by it.<a href=\"#fn10\"><sup>10</sup></a> Due to the lack of data, in this case a group model can only arbitrarily lead to similar results as a microsimulation. If the class of taxpayers with a taxable income less than one DM is neglected in simulation, comparing micro and group models leads to relative deviations in tax revenues for all taxpayers with a negative income employing interpolation using (<i>TI<sub>i</sub><sup>g</sup></i>) of 1.9% (basic tax scale) and \u22121.8% (splitting tax scale) and further, using <i>TI<sub>i</sub></i> of \u22123.5% (basic tax scale) and \u22122.1% (splitting tax scale).",

(The modified taxable income is given by the taxable income increased \u2013 for example by losses that have not yet been offset against profits.) Therefore, the financial consequences of the tax base modification invoke substantially greater relative deviations between the microsimulation and the group simulation. The differences occurring in the lower income classes particularly preponderate. The relative deviations between the microsimulation and the group simulation for the overall financial effects including all income classes are \u22126.9% (basic tax scale) and \u221214.6% (splitting tax scale) using (<i>TI<sub>i</sub><sup>g</sup></i>) and are 14.7% (basic tax scale) and 13.1% (splitting tax scale) referring to <i>TI<sub>i</sub></i>.

Therefore, and in general, it would be desirable that the Statistical Office releases tables of this type. This would improve group model results and thus tax effect simulations.

For the class of taxpayers with a taxable income of less than one DM only very inaccurate results can be obtained. Consequently, this leads again to an overestimation when determining the total financial effects of reduced loss offset using the group model. If we exclude the class of taxpayers with negative income from the analysis we receive an underestimation of the financial effects of 5.1% in the case of the basic tax scale and 8.8% in the case of the splitting tax scale.

Through this comparison we point out and quantify the possible effects of the simplified procedure of the group model, as well as the loss of information involved in using aggregated and incomplete data. The differences identified by concentrating on specific examples do not provide generally validated values. Nevertheless, they indicate the magnitude of possible inaccuracies caused by a group simulation. We find that group simulation under certain circumstances provides results very close in accuracy to those obtained via microsimulation. Furthermore, for those cases in which group simulation is the appropriate tool, we provide a very simple method to interpolate the income distribution and thereby the tax distribution within the classes. This interpolation makes future estimates of tax revenues a lot easier. These results are interesting and important as microsimulation is far more time consuming and resource intensive than group simulation, whilst for cross-country and time series analyses microdata are not usually available and we may well have to fall back, in any case, on group models.",

The differences between the results derived by microsimulation in comparison to group simulation increase if we determine the financial effects of modified tax bases, particularly if tax base cuts vary between taxpayers and if we take account of the class of the taxpayers with a taxable income of less than one DM. Neglecting this class we identify a systematic underestimation simulating the financial consequences of a modified tax base with the group model, assuming a progressive tax scale. In this situation, as disaggregated data on the tax base modification is not available we have to adjust the empirical class average of the tax base reduction. If the group simulation data is not arranged according to the taxable income but rather to the total amount of income we tend to find greater deviations from the microsimulation results in sum as well as per class.",

If, on the other hand, microsimulation relies upon a sample \u2013 as is the case for the German Statistical Office model \u2013 and not on a microdataset with complete coverage, very large deviations may result. These deviations arise from the structure of the stratified random sample, which will not always be representative of circumstances and facts due to a relatively small frequency of responses in each category. In this case, the possible errors due to the group model and the aggregated database are considerably smaller than in case of a microsimulation because in the group simulation we apply data that is based on the overall population in the income tax statistics.",
