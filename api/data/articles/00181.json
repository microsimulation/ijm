To do so, we introduce behaviour into a dynamic microsimulation model applied to the Spanish case. Specifically, the retirement decision is modelled using a reduced-form survival model that provides information on retirement hazards, which are then used to calculate times to retirement within the microsimulation model. This model allows us to account for behavioural responses. For example, the behavioural reaction to the 2011 reform improves pension system sustainability, despite individuals opting to retire later to obtain higher benefits. The positive effect (increase in contributions and reduction in time spent in retirement) is greater than the negative effect (increase in pension levels). Additionally, the model allows us to show howthe positive effects of the education transition and higher rates of female and olderworker participation contribute to reducing the negative impact of population ageing.",

According to the <a href=\"#bib13\">European Commission (2012)</a> the demographic old-age dependency ratio (people aged 65 or above relative to those aged 20\u201364) is projected to increase from 28 to 58% in the EU as a whole over the period 2010\u201360. In this respect, Spain is an extreme example of an abrupt population ageing process, with an old-age dependency ratio rising from 27 to 61%, albeit projected to occur a little later than in other European countries. Sustainability problems are worsened by the fact that the majority of welfare states \u2014among them Spain\u2014 are based on a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) financing system, which means public transfers will be sustained by a proportionally smaller cohort of workers. This is especially true of pension systems in which usual benefits are covered by raising an earmarked tax (social security contributions).",

Yet, there remains some scope for improvements on the demographic side. For example, a delay in the retirement age in line with increasing life expectancy is frequently proposed as a way to both boost contributions and reduce expenditure. Other options for raising contributions in a context of an increasingly scarce labour force could involve an increase in fertility (which would have a long-run impact) and migration (with a short-run impact), and an increase in female workforce participation. Finally, the fact that workers will be more educated in the future may also contribute to boosting sustainability.",

For example, they can change their behaviour in response to pension system reforms, by modifying their retirement decision to optimize their benefits. Indeed, given that retirement choices reflect individual balances between present and future income, leisure and risk perceptions, they can be modelled within the theoretical framework of the life-cycle theory of consumption, based on utility maximization. This approach captures the impact of changes in the budget constraint on the retirement decision, given an individual\u2019s consumption and leisure preferences as reflected in the utility function. A full structural estimation of this model requires the explicit modelling of all these factors, which in turn implies strong parametric assumptions about these preferences. The approach has the advantage of affording a clear interpretation of results, but it poses major challenges of feasibility. In this regard, the seminal work of <a href=\"#bib24\">Miller (1984)</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">Pakes (1984)</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">Rust (1987)</a>, and <a href=\"#bib36\">Wolpin (1984)</a> identified the conditions under which these dynamic discrete choice models were both feasible and relevant for solving key economic questions.",

We use a rich administrative dataset for pensions and work histories, the Muestra Continua de Vidas Laborales or MCVL (Continuous Sample of Working Lives). The MCVL combines administrative information from three sources \u2014the census, the Social Securityregister and the tax records\u2014 and it contains a representative random sample of 4% of the population presenting Social Security records for each year \u2014that is, it includes approximately 1,200,000 individuals for whom data are available about both their current and previous employment history, including their (gross) wages and benefits received. Using a reduced-form model with this rich dataset allows us to obtain a precise picture of reactions to financial incentives. These administrative records are the result of the interaction between individuals\u2019 preferences and constraints, on the one hand, and firms\u2019 decisions, on the other. In this sense, the dataset does not capture heterogeneity in preferences and beliefs, but allows us to readily capture detailed changes in financial incentives and budget constraints. Moreover, a reduced-form hazard model allows for sudden shocks (such as, changes in earnings) to be included in the analysis more readily than is the case with a structural model. Finally, and most importantly, the need to implement the results of the estimation in a microsimulation tool requires a more flexible specification. The parametric assumptions regarding preferences, beliefs and heterogeneity required in a structural analysis are not easily extrapolated to future periods. In discussing these methodological issues, <a href=\"#bib33\">Stock and Wise (1990)</a> discuss the gains in applicability of both approaches and derive a simplified structural model with the advantages of reduced-form models (the option value model). The potential applications of this model are numerous (<a href=\"#bib9\">Casey <i>et al</i>., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gruber &amp; Wise, 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2005</a>).",

In line with previous research for the US (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker, Gruber, &amp; Milligan, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Coile &amp; Gruber, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gruber &amp; Wise, 2005</a>), survival estimates highlight the role played by the economic incentives for retirement implicit in the pension scheme. Specifically, in the reduced-form approach retirement hazard is estimated as a function of individual characteristics (age, education, etc.) and retirement incentives. Still, reduced-form models in form of discrete response or hazard models can be traced back to a utility model as shown by <a href=\"#bib33\">Stock and Wise (1990)</a>. Changes in income reflect changes in utility (avoiding to model consumption), while preferences for leisure can be captured by variables expressing impatience to retire. Including this reduced form retirement behavioural equation in our microsimulation model allows us to define an \u2018optimal time of retirement\u2019 scenario coherent with current regulations and to compare it with the \u2018non-behavioural\u2019 scenario.",

                    "text": "To define the incentives for inclusion in our behavioural model, we take as our starting point recent studies for Spain that estimate the effects of Social Security incentives using the same dataset as the one employed herein (that is, the MCVL). <a href=\"#bib29\">S\u00e1nchez, Argim\u00f3n, Botella, and Gonz\u00e1lez (2013)</a> estimate Social Security Wealth (SSW) \u2014the present net value of net benefits received from the pension system; Social Security Accrual (SSA) \u2014the discounted change in SSW when postponing retirement one year; and the Peak Value (PV), which compares this year\u2019s SSW with the maximum SSW that can be attained in the future. The authors report that the coefficients of all three social security variables are statistically significant with the expected sign. However, the results regarding the effect of measures related to SSW appear somewhat mixed for Spain. It is well known (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gruber &amp; Wise, 2005</a>) that SSW might be endogenous and it may not be possible to separate the effects of financial incentives and the taste for work \u2014both interacting with age. In this respect, several studies (based on a preliminary experimental version of MCVL) report the limited effect of retirement incentives on the retirement decision, suggesting that age is the main determinant (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boldrin, Jim\u00e9nez-Mart\u00edn, &amp; Peracchi, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jim\u00e9nez-Mart\u00edn, 2006</a>). More recently, <a href=\"#bib16\">Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez, Jim\u00e9nez-Mart\u00edn, and S\u00e1nchez-Mart0\u00edn (2013)</a> extended the analysis of the MCVL and their results show that, when incentives are properly defined and problems such as individual heterogeneity are taken into account, incentives have a strong impact on labour market decisions, especially on retirement decisions. We estimated a similar model to that used in <a href=\"#bib29\">S\u00e1nchez <i>et al</i>. (2013)</a> and found that the PV has no impact on the probability of retirement (see Appendix A for more details). Thus, in our microsimulation model, we opted to include a set of incentives that are closer to those in <a href=\"#bib16\">Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez <i>et al</i>. (2013)</a>. The latter authors specify a model that only considers the current pension benefits of retirees and changes in their pension rights. We take a similar approach by considering pension rights and the difference between the expected pension at its highest possible value and the pension if the worker retires in the current year. In line with <a href=\"#bib16\">Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez <i>et al</i>. (2013)</a>, the influence of minimum pensions on low-wage workers is also tracked. We also include current labour income as a financial incentive, which takes the form of wages, for employees, or unemployment benefit, for the unemployed. <a href=\"#bib16\">Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez <i>et al</i>. (2013)</a> also include a proxy of lifecycle wealth as a determinant of the marginal utility of wealth and, consequently, of the relative value of income versus leisure.",

We also include a proxy for the state of the business cycle (unemployment rate). We expect financial incentives and variables related to taste for work and impatience to interact, as is commonly assumed by economic theory: people seek to maximize their income, but they prefer leisure to work. The time dimension operates discounting future gains in terms of both leisure time and money (people are assumed to be impatient). The extent of interplay between these contradictory forces and the possible differences by group (education and gender, mainly) are the focus of our analysis. People aged over 58 and fulfilling the eligibility conditions compute their retirement hazards monthly, and the covariates that determine the retirement decision are also updated monthly. First, individuals are assumed to claim their pension benefit according to a survival model that includes personal characteristics and business cycle indicators, but not financial incentives (non-behavioural model). These variables are age, age squared, education level, last wage, a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 during the first year the individual is eligible and 0 otherwise and, finally, the unemployment rate. This set of variables seeks to capture all the factors involved in any retirement decision and under any regulatory framework.

As expected, the retirement hazard increases with age (at a decreasing rate), but the most powerful effect is that associated with the variable \u2018first year of eligibility\u2019, which increases the hazard for both genders. This is consistent with the fact that between 55 and 60% of people (depending on the year considered) retire as soon as they can (via the \u201cordinary\u201d retirement pathway). The unemployed and those receiving unemployment benefit tend to retire later. As discussed, individuals are forced to retire (via the \u201cordinary\u201d pathway) if they are unemployed at the legal retirement age. In our estimation we eliminated these enforced retirement events as they do not reflect real choices. Hence, the unemployed present in our sample are mostly people eligible for early retirement, observed before their ordinary retirement age. Variables related to financial incentives behave as expected (see explanation above) and the effects of the replacement rate (individual ratio of pension to last wage) and the minimum pension are especially strong. The effect of the PV proxy is also very strong in the case of women (we compute changes in one euro). These results are in line with those reported by <a href=\"#bib16\">Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez <i>et al</i>.

This effect, combined with lower wages, may reduce their entry pension level, obliging them to work longer to achieve financial security. As explained, the retirement choice reflects heterogeneous tastes for work and leisure, and different budget constraints. Longer working careers may reflect work and leisure preferences more aligned to remaining in the labour market (associated with the more highly educated and those earning higher wages).

The inclusion of these variables is not possible for two main reasons: on the one hand, problems of data availability (no data source combines work histories, retirement transitions and pensions with any of these variables for Spain); and, on the other hand, the design of the microsimulation model. We opted to project individuals instead of households (pensions rights are, in Spain, individual), which complicates the modelling of the partner\u2019s incentives. Yet, even if information had been available on health status and savings, projecting these variables into the future is beyond the scope of DyPeS given its current stage of development. However, to test the extent to which health status (disability) and marital status (living with a person of similar age) might influence the retirement decision, we have estimated our model including these variables (see Appendix E for an explanation). Other circumstances (that is, firm agreements or regulations) that force people to retire are eliminated from the model. Our model only includes voluntary retirements, excluding those affected by collective agreements (firms and employees) and those with the obligation to retire due to unemployment status or other circumstances.

As a result, microsimulation models are preferably endowed with simple \u2014non-behavioural\u2014 rules for retirement: for example, assuming that individuals retire as soon as they are eligible (<a href=\"#bib7\">Borella &amp; Moscarola, 2010</a>) or aligning the transitions to the observed patterns (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dekkers <i>et al</i>., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Leombruni &amp; Richiardi, 2006</a>). Recently, <a href=\"#bib34\">Tikanm\u00e4ki, Sihvonen, and Salonen (2015)</a> use dynamic microsimulation techniques to analyze the distributional impact of the forthcoming Finnish pension reform. Similarly to those mentioned before, it is a model without behavioural adjustments in which the age gender-specific behaviour is obtained from a macro model and the differences in transition probabilities between educational groups are extrapolated from the register data. In turn, the econometric literature on retirement behaviour accounts for the role played by the financial incentives embedded in the pension rule by integrating empirical evidence with life-cycle theory \u2014see, for example, <a href=\"#bib2\">Baker <i>et al</i>. (2003)</a> for Canada, <a href=\"#bib5\">Blundell, Meghir, and Smith (2002)</a> for the United Kingdom, <a href=\"#bib10\">Coile and Gruber (2001)</a> for the United States and <a href=\"#bib16\">Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez <i>et al</i>.

For example, <a href=\"#bib7\">Borella and Moscarola (2010)</a> compared the results of a behavioural model with a scenario without behaviour in which people retire as soon as possible. The retirement decision is modelled by estimating a probit model and the main money\u2019s worth measures used are the present value of pension benefits (PVB) and the peak value (PV), defined as the maximum forecasted accrual at each age. In <a href=\"#bib35\">Van Sonsbeek (2010)</a>, the retirement decision is modelled using the option value (OV) approach, first suggested by <a href=\"#bib33\">Stock and Wise (1990)</a>, which combines individual data on wages and on state and private pension entitlements with individually varied option value parameters (time and leisure preferences and risk aversion). In the microsimulation model of <a href=\"#bib33\">Stock and Wise (1990)</a>, the retirement decision is taken definitively at the age of 60, which does not allow the agent to update the changes observed in their final working period. This is crucial for us to simulate changes in mature workers\u2019 participation. In contrast, in our model, agents update expected pensions monthly until they retire, taking into account changing labour market conditions. <a href=\"#bib3\">Bianchi, Romanelli, and Vagliasindi (2003)</a> use an individual reaction function, based on Stock and Wise\u2019s option value model, in which the worker calculates the expected value of the utility of retiring today and in the future, using available information.",

The reform in the number of years used to compute the <i>BR</i> (increasing gradually from 15 to 25) seems to account for the increase in pensions in both scenarios. This effect is surprising at first glance. The expected effect of this measure depends on the shape of the lifetime real earnings profile.<sup><a href=\"#fn8\">8</a></sup> If it is increasing, when the <i>BR</i> takes more years from the past this means a reduction in the wage level considered and, hence, a cut in pension rights. Yet, earnings do not always grow at the same rate across the life cycle. The typical profile can be expected to grow more at the beginning, to stabilise around the age of 50 and, thereafter, to remain constant or possibly worsen, if the career is interrupted by unemployment. Hence, the effect of this measure can be a small cut or even an increase in the pension benefit if wages are not growing in real terms. The unexpected increase in pensions observed during the crisis is probably due to the fact that the increase from 15 to 25 years meant adding years of contributions unaffected by the crisis.",

The change in <i>p</i>(<i>n</i>) means a decrease in the level of initial pensions, reaching almost 2% in the case of the non-behavioural and in the behavioural model. This average negative effect likely conceals positive and negative effects for those with different working careers. In general, reforms of <i>p</i>(<i>n</i>) have potential effects on redistribution. Nevertheless, in this particular case they are small, due to the scale of the reform.

The 2011 reform produces an apparently erratic trend in this number in the behavioural scenario. The only measure that seems to incentivise people to retire earlier during the first years of the simulation is the change in the computation of the BR. This is consistent with the intuition explained above: if the sum of the earlier years of working history used to compute the average base are \u201cbetter\u201d, the incentives to continue working (probably with relatively lower wages) are weaker. The delay in the retirement age causes, as expected, fewer retirements during the first part of the simulation, but is offset during the period 2042\u201353. Unsurprisingly, the only measure that has an effect on the time of retirement in the non-behavioural scenario is the \u201ccompulsory\u201d one: delay in retirement age from 65 to 67. In this scenario, agents are not allowed to use retirement time to react to the changes in financial incentives. Consequently, other measures produce no changes.",

This reflects the fact that women are more likely to be affected by periods of unemployment, although this is partly offset by their increasing labour force participation in the form of transitions from non-participation to employment (note, employment rates are calculated over the total population of young people, including non-participants, while unemployment rates are calculated considering only the active population).",

In this regard, the necessity of capturing the behaviour of agents that present different characteristics requires the use of microsimulation models. With the progressive availability of longitudinal microdata and enhanced computation methods, the most innovative models can aim at capturing the behavioural response of individuals to retirement incentives. In this paper, we have introduced individual behaviour into a dynamic microsimulation model applied to Spain (DyPeS). The retirement decision is modelled using a reduced-form survival model that provides information on retirement hazards. These are then introduced into the microsimulation model to estimate times of retirement. DyPeS is applied to a rich administrative dataset (the MCVL) produced by the Spanish Social Security. The model reproduces the main life-cycle events that affect pensions: birth, entry into the labour market, unemployment, retirement and death. DyPeS is a case-and population-based model, and was modelled in continuous time. It was implemented using ModGen, a programming language developed by Statistics Canada.",

Two of these aimed at increasing its contributory nature (by raising the number of years needed to compute the initial pension and by changing their weight in the formula, making it more proportional). A second measure aimed at reducing early retirement and promoting delayed retirement (by increasing the penalty in the case of the former and the premium in the case of the latter). Finally, the main measure was the delay to the general retirement age from 65 to 67. Our results show that accounting for individuals\u2019 behavioural responses enhances projected pension system sustainability. Specifically, the total pension expenditure to wage bill ratio, which increases until 2036 in the non-behavioural model, would initially fall until 2022 and only increase in the period 2022\u201331. Interestingly, the delay in retirement age has the most significant effect on pension expenditure, while measures modifying the computation of the initial pension for new retirees have a limited impact.",

In relation to the former, we examine two hypothetical scenarios, one that reverses the education transition and another that assumes all qualified workers find employment in the highest contribution group. Results show that education and, more specifically, the capacity of the labour market to absorb qualified workers, do matter. Higher levels of educational attainment mean higher wages in the short and medium term, reducing significantly the pension expenditure to wage bill ratio until 2050. Yet, they also imply higher pension benefits in the distant future, but with a limited impact on sustainability. In contrast, the lower education scenario produces a marked increase in the ratio until 2042, given the lower wages financing pensions. Sustainability only improves when the lower educated workers retire on correspondingly lower pensions.",

These variables are commonly used in the literature (<a href=\"#bib38\">Gruber &amp; Wise, 2005</a>) and particularly in previous studies for Spain (<a href=\"#bib39\">S\u00e1nchez, Argim\u00f3n, Botella, &amp; Gonz\u00e1lez, 2013</a>). These authors use SSW, the Social Security Accrual (SSA) and PV and find that all the coefficients of these social security variables are statistically significant with the expected sign. Increases in the total present value of the flow of pensions that a person will receive from the year she retires to the year she dies, i.e. a rise in SSW, increase the hazard. Increases in the difference of this amount derived from postponing the retirement (either one or more years) reduce the hazard, irrespectively of whether SSA or PV is used to capture the substitution effects. By contrast, after controlling from other variables we find that the effects of the SSW and PV variables are very weak, being non-significant in the case of the PV. Hence, we opted for discarding this model and used the one explained in Section 3 to describe the social security incentives involved in the retirement decision. Two different kinds of reasons might explain why our results differ from those found in <a href=\"#bib39\">S\u00e1nchez <i>et al</i>. (2013)</a>: some related to the data employed and others related to the model. First, there are differences in the subsamples employed. <a href=\"#bib39\">S\u00e1nchez <i>et al</i>. (2013)</a> use a subsample of people entitled to a pension benefit and aged from 60 to 70 in 2006. Our period of reference is longer (2005 to 2010) and includes people aged from 60 to 75. That is to say, we observe retirement transitions occurring between 2005 and 2010 and not only in 2006. In this respect, the inclusion of three years affected by the economic crisis may affect the retirement patterns observed. Second, the period discrete time-varying variable in <a href=\"#bib39\">S\u00e1nchez <i>et al</i>. (2013)</a> is defined in years, and ours is defined in months. Finally, models are not identical. For example, <a href=\"#bib39\">S\u00e1nchez <i>et al</i>. (2013)</a> use control variables \u2014such as regional dummies\u2014 that we do not include in our model. Note that in our modelling framework we can only include the variables that we are going to reproduce for future periods in our microsimulation model.",

The main driving force of the changes observed is the decrease in the pension level, due to poorer working careers. This effect is sizeable, starting during the crisis and reaching 30% for the cohort retiring in 2036. The amount of past years\u2019 contributions considered to compute the basic pension amount (<i>BR</i>) being between 15 and 25, it is obvious that these cohorts are those most affected by the cut in wages and unemployment spells associated with the crisis. As a result, there is an impact on the time path of the number of entry pensions. The crisis produces a delay in retirement during the period 2013\u20132018, probably caused by the need to offset losses of potential pension associated with lower wages and less time worked. This delay in retirement during the crisis produces the opposite effect during the following years: from 2019 to 2026, we observe more retirements in the scenario with crisis than in the baseline one. All these results show that there is a reaction in retirement decisions due to the big movements in labour status that the current crisis produces. In a behavioural model such as the one considered here, agents can exit the labour market through early retirement, escaping penalties, and then avoid a higher reduction in entry pension level. As we will see in the next section it seems that, when behaviour is incorporated into the model, workers effectively tend to retire later, coping in this way with the effect of the crisis on their labour careers. As shown in panels C and D of <a href=\"#figC1\">Figure C.1</a>, the total effect of the crisis in terms of increasing total expenditure and ratio of pensions to wage bill is huge, despite the sizeable delay in entry pensions shown in <a href=\"#figC2\">Figure C.2</a>. It is mostly the consequence of the dramatic fall in wages due to the crisis, which has permanent effects (see panel B of <a href=\"#figC1\">Figure C.1</a>) This sensitivity analysis shows the potentially strong impact of the crisis and illustrates the difficulties in projecting the future evolution of wages and in designing the interplay between the micro and macro modules of the model.",

The results are quite robust in the case of men. There are no changes in the sign of the coefficients and the magnitudes are quite similar. However, the differences between the estimations in the case of women are remarkable. Whereas previously the effect of age had been linear and negative, it is now quadratic and strongly positive. In fact, the results are now similar to those for men. The reasons for this may be linked to the impact of the crisis (that is, more women needing to work longer). Also, the coefficient for unemployment changes its sign, due to extreme changes in the value of unemployment rates.",

Although these variables are to some degree represented in the sample, the information is insufficient to be projected in the simulation model. First, the only indicator for health status in the Muestra Continua de Vidas Laborales (MCVL) is the degree of disability (expressed as a percentage). Second, as regards marital status, the survey only contains information about the number, age, and gender of cohabitants. It is therefore impossible to match couples in the dataset and, hence, to know their characteristics or gauge the effect of financial incentives for retirement on a joint decision. The MCVL is based on individual not household records. Fortunately, while far from perfect, this information does allow us to test for the importance of omitted variable bias.",

However, studies of the Spanish case are scarce. No data base reports both health status and financial incentives to retire. In fact, the MCVL is the only work history database that includes a variable related to health status, namely, disability. Therefore, we have re-estimated the same model including this time the degree of disability and a dummy variable for disability. The results indicate that the inclusion of this variable does not alter substantially the impact of the other variables. Its impact on retirement is significant formen (reducing retirement hazards) but not for women. This finding is in line with that obtained by <a href=\"#bib39\">S\u00e1nchez <i>et al</i>. (2013)</a> <i>et al</i>. (2013), who also use the MCVL to explain retirement behaviour and include a dummy variable for disability in their model. Those receiving disability benefits the year before re- tirement show a lower hazard, probably reflecting the fact that, besides having a poorer health, they will probably be the ones receiving retirement disability pensions when they turn 65, the only age at which pensions of this type can be awarded, so they will tend to wait until they reach that age.",

Panel C and D present the ratio between the number of pensions/entry pensions and the population aged 65 or older. As expected, the be- havioural model reproduces more precisely the observed behaviour. Only for the ratio of new pen-sioners to population aged 65 or older the simulation describes a sizeable different pattern compared to the observed ratio. Nevertheless, this trend is corrected and, for the last year with available observa- tions (2016), there is no appreciable difference between the behavioural model and the actual rates.",
