In the current debate on the importance of scaling up infrastructure to stimulate growth, some analysts raise concerns about potential negative macroeconomic impacts (Dutch disease). This study aims to provide some insight into this debate by extending the analysis to include distributional analysis. We draw from the infrastructure productivity literature to postulate positive productive externalities of new infrastructure and from <a href=\"#bib24\">Fay and Yepes (2003)</a> to include operating and maintenance costs associated with new infrastructure. We investigate two fiscal tools and foreign aid as mechanisms to fund the new infrastructure and associated costs. The distributional analysis is performed with FGT indices and growth incidence curves. Our results reveal that infrastructure spending reduces poverty. Foreign aid is shown to be the most equitable funding mechanism, whereas a value added tax provides the strongest poverty reduction.",

Theoretical models and empirical studies have attempted to shed some light on this relationship. Some authors believed that a decline in productivity would be induced by slow expansion of public infrastructure investment (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bergman &amp; Suan 1996</a>; and <a href=\"#bib9\">Binder &amp; Smith 1997</a>). In policy circles, the role of infrastructure was somewhat neglected in the context of the stabilization and structural adjustment programs of the mid-eighties and nineties. For many international institutions and developing countries the focus was directed at liberalizing trade, improving macroeconomic balances and reacting to various external shocks. With improvements in these areas yet sluggish results in terms of poverty reduction in many countries, the end of the nineties saw major changes in development strategies by international financial institutions (IFI), development partners and governments of developing countries.",

This reflects a change in priorities of developing country governments, IFIs and multi- and bilateral donor agencies bringing infrastructure back to the top of the policy agenda. The Asian Development Bank organized a major conference entitled \u201cInfrastructure Development: Private Solutions for the Poor\u201d in October 2002 in Manila. This conference dealt with issues such as making infrastructure projects pro-poor, increasing private sector participation to scale up infrastructure and strengthening and increasing pro-poor public-private infrastructure partnerships. It built on a May 2000 conference organized by the Department for International Development (DFID-UK) and the World Bank. The World Bank\u2019s world development report published in <a href=\"#bib54\">2001</a> is another important illustration of this change, as is the implementation in many developing countries of Poverty Reduction Strategy Programs (PRSPs). More recently the <a href=\"#bib6\">Asian Development Bank (2009)</a> published a report on investing in sustainable infrastructure to improve lives. Since the turn of the century, poverty has been at the centre of all development strategies. In many developing countries, growth is constrained by infrastructure bottlenecks and this is reflected in many investment climate surveys in which infrastructure ranks as the top priority (<a href=\"#bib21\">Estache, 2007</a>).<a href=\"#fn1\"><sup>1</sup></a>",

One important determinant that has been identified is improvements in productivity. Education has received great attention as a tool to improve labour productivity. As a result, significant investments have been made, and major reforms have been implemented, to improve education in developing countries. At the same time, more and more analysts have raised the issue of deteriorated or obsolete infrastructure in developing countries as a stumbling block for growth. In many countries, infrastructure growth has not kept up with economic and demographic growth and in some instances infrastructure was not even maintained. This situation has led many analysts to return to the literature linking public expenditure to infrastructure. These stakeholders have argued that major investments to scale up infrastructure levels would transform their role from a constraint to an engine of growth that would contribute indirectly to poverty reduction in the long term.",

In the report, the authors argue that improved infrastructure will accelerate urbanization, which has been the engine for growth in many countries, and will also improve regional integration. They focus on the potential contribution to the growth of various forms of infrastructure such as information and communication technologies, electricity, transportation (in a broad sense), water, irrigation and sanitation. They further decompose the respective contributions of investments in roads, railway, ports and airports. The report also investigates the impact on poverty, the role of institutions and the various options available. The main contribution of this report is to provide an estimate of infrastructure spending in Africa needed to achieve optimal growth rates.

They construct an aggregate model and apply it to Uganda to verify this. We extend this idea by dropping the dichotomous classification of sectors as tradable and non-tradable. We also introduce an additional element by imposing increases in public expenditure to maintain and repair the new public infrastructure as in <a href=\"#bib22\">Estache <i>et al</i>. (2007)</a>.

The first and most commonly used one is the representative household approach (CGE-RH), the second is the top-down, layered or microsimulation sequential approach (CGE-MSS), and the third is usually referred to as the CGE integrated multi-household (CGE-IMH) (see <a href=\"#bib15\">Davies (2009</a>) for a detailed description of these approaches).",

                    "text": "Without going into a complete review of these approaches, we wish to highlight a few of their drawbacks in order to situate the contribution of the Top-down/bottom-up approach. First, despite extensive applications for distributive analysis, the CGE-RH has been strongly criticized for its inability to capture intra group changes in distribution (see <a href=\"#bib49\">Savard (2005)</a> &amp; <a href=\"#bib46\">Robilliard <i>et al</i>. (2008)</a> for an elaboration of this critique). The main drawback of the CGE-MSS approach is that it does not fully take into account the feedback effects to the CGE model of household behaviour in the microsimulation model. In fact, when micro-household behaviour aggregates perfectly, this approach implicitly integrates the feedback effect. However, when household behaviour does not aggregate perfectly, the aggregation error is lost in the process.<a href=\"#fn2\"><sup>2</sup></a> The interesting question is to know the size of this aggregation error. If the aggregation error is small, not taking it into account is unlikely to bias results, but this is not the case if the error is relatively large. This critique of the CGE-MSS approach has been highlighted in two literature reviews of macro-micro modelling for poverty analysis (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hertel and Reimer (2005)</a> &amp; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bourguignon and Spadaro (2006)</a>). The third approach is the CGE-IMH, which is theoretically sound but presents a few challenges. First, it requires significant data treatment to balance out each household account and reconcile micro-household data with the national account data of the SAM. Also, large models with complex non linear functions can lead to convergence problems. These problems are raised in <a href=\"#bib48\">Rutherford <i>et al</i>. (2005)</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">Chen and Ravallion (2004)</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">Bourguignon and Savard (2008)</a>.",

                    "text": "To circumvent these problems, we apply a more flexible variant of the CGE-IMH that draws from the CGE-MSS approach. The basic idea is to push the CGE-MSS approach further by explicitly taking into account the feedback effect of the microsimulation model. This makes it possible to take into account the aggregation error of the micro-household model in the CGE model. We refer to this approach as the \u201cTop-down/bottom-up\u201d (CGE-TD/BU) approach. The approach provides greater flexibility for modelling household behaviour compared to the CGE-IMH approach by introducing a bi-directional link between the CGE and microsimulation models to obtain a convergent solution. The main drawback of the approach is that convergence is not guaranteed and must be verified for each simulation. The approach allows the modeller to use the exact income and expenditure structure found in the household income and expenditure surveys, since perfect coherence between micro and macro data is not required. Another advantage is that there is no limit to the level of disaggregation in terms of production sectors and the number of households to be included in the model. Finally, and most importantly, the degree of freedom in choices of functional forms used to reflect the micro-economic heterogeneity of household behaviour is as great as in the CGE-MSS approach.",

However, this is not an important issue as we are mostly interested in the comparative analysis between the different scenarios.

The increase in informal wages originates from pressure for labour demand in public services (1.87%, from <a href=\"#tableA4\">Table A.4</a> in the appendix) that must grow to meet the M&amp;O needs created by new investment and the expansion of the construction sector (1.81%; <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a>) to build the new infrastructure.

VAT funding will have a tendency to favour sectors in which initial VAT rates were lower and, consequently, households that consume a lower share of goods and services with high VAT rates in the reference period. Workers and owners of capital in the sectors with higher VAT rates will experience a stronger negative impact. Moving on to the income tax scenario, on the income side we will have a stronger negative impact on households that pay income taxes. As a result, the price of goods consumed by households with higher income decrease more compared to the first scenario. The price effect may dominate the income effect for certain households. Foreign aid financing produces a price and income effect via the appreciation of the exchange rate given the fixed current account balance. This will favour consumers of imported goods on the price side. On the income side, the non tradable sectors will be favoured and hence capital owners and workers used intensively in these sectors will benefit the most.",

This can produce unusual distributional effects. For example, a relatively rich household in the reference period can become unemployed after simulation and lose a large portion of its income.",

As we highlighted in the macro analysis, this comes from the relatively small nominal increase in public investment, but we can still draw interesting conclusions on relative impacts between productive and non productive investments and between the three funding schemes. Starting at the national level, with non productive investments, we observe a decrease in poverty only for the VAT scenario. This reduction is observed for the three poverty indices, ranging from 0.26% for the headcount index (FGT-0) to 0.30% for poverty severity (FGT-2). The income tax and foreign aid scenarios for non productive investment produce an increase in poverty severity ranging up to 1.33% for the income tax option and 0.88% for foreign aid. This is interesting in that GDP and aggregate household income increased in both those scenarios. This illustrates the importance of using a microsimulation approach to determine the distributional and welfare impact of such reforms. The option generating the greatest increases in poverty is the income tax option.",

For the VAT simulation, we can identify a weak trend favouring the most educated households.

We also illustrate how to exploit this modelling exercise to analyze the distributional impact of scaling up infrastructure investment on macroeconomic, sectoral variables in the Philippines. The approach allows us to capture numerous issues surrounding infrastructure expansion among which are productivity externalities, job creation, relative price changes, crowing out, Dutch disease, funding issues, fiscal constraints and distributional analysis. We build on the models presented in papers such as <a href=\"#bib1\">Adam and Bevan (2006)</a> and <a href=\"#bib23\">Estache <i>et al</i>. (2008)</a> by introducing rigorous distributional analysis. Our macro results are different than those of these authors given the presence of unemployment, which contributes to attenuating or reversing the Dutch disease effect that is also softened by the production externality assumption. We also present a framework that allows the analyst to explore the poverty impact of such programs and identify the most favourable funding option based on two distributional analyses (FGT and GIC). As in <a href=\"#bib23\">Estache <i>et al</i>. (2008)</a>, we do not observe strong differences at the macro level when comparing funding options to scale up infrastructure. However, our poverty analysis allowed us to clearly rank the performance of each funding option to establish that the VAT is most favourable, followed by foreign aid and finally income taxes.",

Another issue is that the returns on investment in infrastructure might come in the medium to long term. To improve the analysis on this front, a recursive dynamic framework would be a more appropriate tool. In our future research we will extend this model in this direction. The major challenge for this work program will be to introduce a capital reallocation mechanism at the micro level. To our knowledge, only one set of authors (<a href=\"#bib3\">Annabi <i>et al</i>., 2005)</a> applied a dynamic CGE microsimulation model, but they failed to rigorously capture the distributional factor growth issue as stated in <a href=\"#bib15\">Davies (2009)</a>. The uniform redistributed capital growth underestimated the distributional impact of the growth elements in the model and this issue needs to be resolved along the lines suggested by <a href=\"#bib15\">Davies (2009)</a> in further research.",

Or, as <a href=\"#bib43\">Preston (1959)</a> states, the aggregation problem is tied to the link between micro and macro theory and therefore differences that can occur between large models (microsimulation models) and smaller models (macro models) relying on aggregated variables and parameters. This is exactly the problem at hand with linking CGE models with microsimulation models. To respond to this problem, a few decades back <a href=\"#bib29\">Gorman (1953)</a> demonstrated that using or assuming the same marginal consumption and saving propensities was sufficient to solve this problem and obtain perfect linear aggregation. According to <a href=\"#bib16\">Deaton and Muellbauer (1980)</a>, this solution is extremely restrictive since it imposes linear and identical Engle curves for all households in a microsimulation model. Moreover, this assumption is incompatible with empirical analysis of household consumption behaviour. The second problem is linked to the household specific labour supply. <a href=\"#bib16\">Deaton and Muellbauer (1980)</a> present the conditions for aggregation of labour supply with the following cost function:",
