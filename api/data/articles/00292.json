                "text": "Work on this micro based macro model of the Swedish Economy began in late 1974 as a joint project between the Federation of Swedish Industries, IBM Sweden and the University of Uppsala. This is an edited version of several instruction manuals I wrote for the coding and later programming of that model. It was published in December 1976 as \"A micro - macro Interactive Simulation Model of the Swedish Economy\" by the Federation and IBM in two parallel editions. A technical pseudo code to facilitate the final coding of the model in APL, authored jointly by myself, Mats Heiman and G\u00f6sta Olavi, was appended to that publication. This republication of the 1976 document, has been slightly trimmed, and lack the Foreword by the President of the Federation, Author\u2019s Remarks, and the Pseudocode. The Pseudocode is however available from the Journal online as (<a href=\"#bib23\">Eliasson et al., 1976</a>). It details the specifications and highlights the modular design of the model and should be helpful for anybody who might want to reproduce a version of the model.",

Of particular interest were the consequences of markets being disturbed by inflation. The modelling approach was bottom up, drawing extensively on empirical research in business economics, not least on my own study on business economic planning practices (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eliasson, 1976a</a>). The model has a general design in that it integrates a standard Keynesian demand driven macro model with a Leontief type input output sector structure. The manufacturing subindustries, furthermore, are populated with boundedly rational (\u201cignorant\u201d) firms <a href=\"#bib45\">(Simon, 1955; Simon 1959)</a>. These firms make up the core market governed supply machinery of the model, and integrate product, labor, and financial market considerations within their business plans. Firms compete in the markets of the model. Their plans and decisions are guided by Stockholm School ex ante price expectations and learning from feed backs of ex post outcome experiences. Schumpeterian entrepreneurs enter markets unexpectedly and compel incumbents to perform. Market competition thus self-coordinates the entire model economy under an upper technology constraint embodied in new investments of firms. The government may intervene in markets, but there are no artificial external equilibrium constraints imposed. I had no ambition to build a micro foundation of existing macro theory, neither has the model been designed to provide forecasts to support policy. The ambition has been to understand what government can do to the economy as one of many monopoly actors with boundedly rational insights.",

There is a difference, however, in that focus is on the dynamics of agents interacting both across markets and sequentially over time (dynamics), and that the micro units are heterogeneous production firms, rather than individuals and households that dominate the micro simulation literature. My main ambition is to explore the role of markets in macro-economic development. Hence, firms\u2019 behavior is governed by their expectations about prices. In formulating the model, I have drawn significantly on the Stockholm School ex ante anticipations and ex post plan outcome feed backs that I experimented with in my doctorate thesis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eliasson, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Eliasson, 1969</a>). In modelling firm planning I have drawn directly on my interview study (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eliasson, 1976a</a>) of planning practices in European, Japanese and US manufacturing firms, that concludes (in chapter XI) with a proposed model of the firm. My ambition has been to parameterize the firm model as close as possible to the planning and decision parameters that firms\u2019 top management recognizes, irrespective of how that design tallies with received microeconomic theory. The philosophy behind the model is that we need to understand how micro agents (firms, households etc.) interact in markets to understand economy wide behavior. I have no ambition to clarify the micro foundations of existing macro theory.",

Therefore, it becomes tempting to disaggregate into subsectors, and sub-sectors of sub-sectors. Quite soon we have a one thousand equation model that we have difficulties making intellectual sense of. Micro behavioral characteristics have been aggregated away, so has also been the competitive market machinery that governs the dynamic allocation of resources in the economy across decision units and over time. Neither do we know what the parameters stand for because of estimation problems like collinearity, feed backs within periods etc., and our subsectors quite arbitrarily cut right through the decision units.",

In <i>practice</i> there is a difference, however, since the ambition of this project is to take the analysis down to the level of a firm defined by its financial accounts that makes decisions in markets, and to study (1) the micro basis for inflation and (2) the interaction of firms so defined across markets and over time and how these market interactions affect inflation, profitability, the allocation of resources and economic growth. To model the role of markets in economy wide behavior mathematical simulation, or micro simulation is the only theoretical and empirical method available. While it allows realistic specification, parameter estimation becomes increasingly difficult. Since firms\u2019 behavior, their interactions in markets, and how markets aggregate it all up to macro is beyond macro modelling, these estimation problems simply must be dealt with. Conventional statistical estimation methods will probably have to be abandoned and some other kind of calibration and inference method resorted to. I will address these problems as they come. Above all, empirically relevant specification comes first and should not be compromised to facilitate parameter estimation.",

For the time being we have constructed a conventional, and in no way complex economy wide model within which a micro (firm) specified manufacturing industry operates. This approach allows us to keep our special features: namely a micro specification of the behavior of three integrated markets: The labor market, several product markets and a financial system, a bank.

                            "text": "Interesting economy wide dynamics arises when ex ante incompatible supplies of heterogeneous firms and demands are confronted in the three markets of the model, during periods and between periods (quarters), and firms constantly must revise their plans because of mistaken expectations. This dynamic relates to the ex ante ex post dichotomy of Stockholm School economists that I used to \u201cexplain\u201d revisions of investment plans by firms in my doctorate thesis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eliasson, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Eliasson, 1969</a>). The non clearing market dynamics that arises at the micro level is no transparent analytical story, and it should not be made up as such. We have learned about its economy wide importance through simulation practice when trying to calibrate the model. Only in the very short run, we have understood, is it acceptable to abstract from market price quantity inconsistencies that keep markets from clearing. They are everywhere present but tend not to go away and often cumulate into major economy wide change. As you experiment with the micro to macro model you learn how to identify the origin of consequent economy wide changes, that as a rule have been found to have empirically reasonable explanations, thus our emphasis on empirically relevant specification, high quality data and proper parameter calibration. Familiarity with some details of the model is however needed to understand the nature of this complex market interaction dynamics, so I will come back to it in Section 8 when the whole model has been presented in sufficient detail. One example could however be mentioned already here, since it can be analytically predicted, and may be important, but was discovered when preparing for some experiments aimed at establishing the market relationships between technological change on the one hand, a micro level phenomenon, and macroeconomic growth and employment on the other. Since firms are constantly operating way under their potential (section 1.1.1. and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), and with equipment that is far below the best practice productivity standard that comes with new investment, as our statistical data show, the question constantly popped up; Why not force firms to raise output, or shed redundant workers to raise profits. As the model has been designed it all depends on how markets that relate technology and employment to economic output function. So, the natural way to enforce that outcome in a model with explicit markets and empirically well documented firm behavioral characteristics, is not to change firm behavior, but to raise market competition. What happens, for instance, if some managers in the most profitable firms try to capture the potential profit opportunities of available new technology by raising investments and their rate of recruitment of additional workers. This not only increases their growth, but raises competition with other firms for limited resources, and forces other firms to react in order not to be forced out of the market. If all firms try to outcompete each other through investing and recruiting workers from each other, prices on inputs, and notably wages, will be bid up and stop the process long before all workers have been hired by the most productive firms, and the most productive firm has substituted the globally best technology (through investment) for its existing production equipment. So that \u201cneoclassical optimum\u201d is unreachable in the short run because of steeply increasing costs trying to reach it. But since remaining incumbents have now upgraded their technology (productivity) performance, and even more productive new technology will become available through new investment, the next period will offer even higher levels of technology for everybody to learn from and access through new investment. The \u201coptimum neoclassical \u201cstate of the economy will therefore still be as unreachable as before, not only because of the steeply (endogenous) cost increases experienced in trying to reach it \u201cimmediately\u201d , but also because (endogenous) structural change has altered its location . In neoclassical terms, trying to exploit the technological opportunities too fast, model firms run up against steeply diminishing returns, but the explanation is not neoclassical and a property of the production function, but depends on steeply rising market transactions costs in trying to get there too fast. Over the longer-term investments and the introduction of new technology in all firms caused by increased competition will however represent a collective body of new technology for firms to learn from that gradually lifts the short term constraint. In models without markets, such as traditional neoclassical macro sector models, for instance the <a href=\"#bib29\">Johansen (1960)</a> sector model \u201cof economic growth\u201d, that lacks markets, that explanation is lost. It makes sense in future simulation experiments to keep our eyes open for these effects, since our micro based macro model will not only generate new economic phenomena, perhaps not thought of before, but also allow new and economically more relevant explanations.",

Realism in specification in combination with explicit modelling of dynamic market selection means selection based economic growth and an initial state dependent and highly nonlinear model. This necessitates that we at least for the time being give up on well known, standard econometric estimation techniques, as far as several sections of the model go. In a way, however this is a common experience with practically all large-scale macro models, only that initial state dependent nonlinear models based on selection make the problems much more difficult. There is however one decisive advantage with microsimulation modelling. All models are based on a priori specifications that condition estimated parameters, as well as the interpretation of empirical results. A well-researched prior specification of the model, as in our case, therefore, enters as exogenous and reliable information and should, in that respect, make estimated parameters more reliable, even though more difficult to obtain. When the estimated parameters cannot be stochastically interpreted, we talk about calibration, and we must decide for ourselves on the relative importance of relevant specification and reliable parameter estimates when interpreting the simulation results.",

This means that its use should in principle be up to the same requirements as those of conventional macro models. This might, however, erroneously be taken to mean that requirements on relevance in micro specification are less demanding in macro modelling than in our micro to macro model. Quite the opposite. The main ambition of our entire modelling project is to understand how an economy can be self-coordinated by agents competing in markets, all taking place under an upper technology constraint (see below). Hence, <i>firm behavior in markets will have to be explicitly represented and modelled, and in future hopefully also households and individuals</i>. Macro models have nothing to say about this. Only if those micro specified market selection phenomena can be demonstrated to have a negligible influence on the behavior of the economy at large could one be satisfied with simple macro relationships. But before you hasten prematurely to such an assumption you must study the relevance of that simplification, at least theoretically. And that can be done by studying the mathematical properties of our model through simulation analysis. Early trial simulation experiments also suggest that it is not acceptable to neglect the role of markets and selection in macroeconomic behavior. Micro and markets seem to matter significantly for macro. Our modelling ambition therefore appears to make sense, and macroeconomics perhaps be in for a future problem of irrelevance.",

The design of the model can be continuously improved as we learn more from its general theoretical properties and get more test data. Such is at least the modelling strategy. As we confront the model with new empirical data it becomes important that we find a method to discard incorrect alternatives only, <i>without running the risk of throwing out correct alternatives</i>. This also means that the modelling effort has been defined as a never-ending experimental process that is continually improved - or abandoned - as it is confronted with new test information.

And a model that has generated correct forecasts for some time might be entirely wrong the next time, and if that matters for your decision, you had better understand that ahead of time. Beliefs are also a private problem. Beliefs certainly enter all decisions. When it comes to convincing outsiders, they must believe in what you advise. Empirical credibility becomes an issue, as for instance in economy wide cost benefit analyses of politically sensitive decisions to be taken, for which the model we are now putting together should be a superb tool (<a href=\"#bib49\">Winkler, 1967</a>). What happens to the economy if you do this?

And that is difficult enough. Several combinations of parameters should be expected to generate model output that resembles the numbers generated by the Swedish economy. Statistical testing of well-defined parameter combinations against historic data from the Swedish economy should be the method to discriminate between them. Fortunately, perhaps, our experience has not been of that kind. We have rather found it difficult to find one good alternative. Hence, we must turn our problem formulation around again. For those specifications that we are, so to speak, satisfied with in terms of their ability to trace economic development well, we must devise techniques to check that we have not happened to come upon a specification that is incorrect. And if we happen to find several specification alternatives among which we are unable to discriminate, we simply need more empirical data to choose. Thus, for instance, inflation is currently a great policy concern. We have also found that inflation tends to feed through model firms' expectations, and not only affect their production, recruitment and investments, and their willingness to raise wages, but also tend to get stuck in, and even overrshoot in future periods' expectations. To understand this economy wide market dynamics better and to help calibrate the model an econmetric study has been carried out at my Federation department <a href=\"#bib27\">Genberg (1975)</a>. Implications are that the macroeconomic risks of inflation do not only run through wages, as suggested by partial macro models, but also, and perhaps more importantly for the longer term, distort investment decisions and the allocation of resources. Search techniques to fit simulation models automatically to test data have been developed for simple cases (see <a href=\"#bib43\">Powell, 1964</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Powell, 1965</a>). To begin with we are working with a similar hands on manual calibration procedure (see 1.3.3 below), but hoping to come up with a more sphisticated computer based method in the future. In science, as in decision making, it is often far more important to see clearly what one doesn't know, than to be able to account for one\u2019s knowledge. Hence the importance of getting the specification of the model right. This is also the way we go about estimating the parameters of the model.",

The diffusion through the economy of inflation is of a cyclical nature, while the relationship between inflation, profits and growth are a long-term concern. Since inflation causes disorder in market pricing and affect price predictability negatively the short- and longer-term concerns are however compounded over time in intricate ways. Since studying the economy wide consequences of this complex market dynamics was the reason for starting this modelling project to begin with, the consequent empirical problems simply have to be dealt with. It is also well recognized that such complicated relationships cannot be represented in macro models. Lags between cause and effect are long, involving intricate short-term feedbacks between actors in markets and over time integrating experience, expectations, plans and realizations.

This has caused some problems of consistency when (under \u00a74) the initial state data are aggregated up to the Swedish National Accounts level where the statistical taxonomy is production rather than market oriented (See below). The causal ordering of decision sequences under \u00a71, furthermore, has allowed us to replace several time reaction parameters (in macro models) with directly observed decision and selection sequences in firms. Thus, for instance, firms exit at the latest when they have legally run out of equity, or earlier when their returns to equity have been running below the interest rate for many years, if, in the latter case, the firm has a management parameter that instructs it to do so. Remaining asset values are then sold in the investment goods market, or (for inventories) in product markets, loans repaid and remaining positive equity values added to household disposable income.",

In addition, we need better and more precise historic test data to evaluate model macro performance. The changeover to this database will take place at a time when a new, extended version of the model is planned to be ready.

The primary source of information is my own interview study of business economic planning (<a href=\"#bib18\">Eliasson, 1976a</a>) that concludes in Chapter XI with a sketch of a firm model. I begin here with specifying the algorithms that determine how expectations and targets are formed based on experience, external information, and on how profit targets are determined. It is basically a \"looking in the mirror\" adaptive approach to the future of a boundedly rational firm in the sense of <a href=\"#bib45\">Simon (1955)</a> and <a href=\"#bib46\">Simon (1959)</a>, complemented with the possibility to use external information, for instance learning from other firms, or from external forecasts. It should also be possible to use this external slot to investigate the systemic consequences of noise input into the economy of the kind done before by <a href=\"#bib26\">Frisch (1933)</a>. The difference between our model and the other two is that disturbances in our case are transmitted into the economy by way of price changes in product, labour and financial markets, that are integrated from quarter to quarter in the formation of expectations and business plans of individual firms, not as an external knock on a mechanical system of difference equations.",

The reason of course is the almost complete lack of generalized empirical knowledge about these matters, but also the limitations of expression imposed by the standard math commonly used in economic analysis. Hence the use of mathematical simulation or micro simulation in this modelling project is a methodological innovation that has expanded the range of theoretical expression, very much in the spirit of <a href=\"#bib31\">Koopmans (1957)</a>, who concluded that the modern computer might \u201cwell restore the numerical example to a position of honor among tools of analysis in regard to problems too difficult for more general solution\u201d. We will see how much methodological controversy must be overcome to bring that understanding into economic theory (. Interdisciplinary travel seems to have given rise more to personal problems than to praise of those who have tried.

I suggest, however, that we leave that alternative for the time being. To make sense such an extension will have to await a more detailed modelling of the (Swedish) corporate income system. A reduction in internal profitability requirements (compared with direct financial investments) is, for instance, associated with large tax wedges, in some industrial economies due to the tax leakage that occurs when funds are distributed as dividends. Furthermore, fiscal depreciation allowances that are faster than economically motivated exercise the same cash containing influence on firm management as well as stock owners, who prefer to get their money back as capital gains (from successful investments) in share prices that are taxed at a lower total rate than dividends. This will however easily become an illusion if the accumulated interest free tax credit makes firm management less disciplined in assessing the profitability of their investments.",

This occurs when firms have difficulties in satisfying their profit targets. A necessary complement to this feature is to explain how such reserve slack accumulates within the firm. This accumulation is part of the investment process in so far as that we assume that part of the productivity potential of a new investment is not made full use of. \u201cWasted\u201d productivity is potentially there in the form of a reserve, but up to a limit, above which it becomes true waste. Model f<i>irms that have been successful for a long time and never have been forced to resort to slack activation, hence, tend to accumulate slack in the production system</i> and waste potential productivity. On the other hand, competitive pressure and frequent target non-satisfaction tend to keep this waste at a minimum and RES below the maximum allowed. This, however, does not necessarily have to be a healthy thing in the long run, since investment spending may be affected negatively. Thus, as the model economy progresses through time a continuous balancing takes place of the benefits from competition in terms of \u201cstatic productivity increases\u201d, and the benefits of profitability of investments in long term growth. A rational explanation for the presence of various forms of slack within (firm) organizations assumed in some theorizing during the last two decades (<a href=\"#bib53\">Cyert and Marc, 1963</a>;<a href=\"#bib32\">Leibenstein, 1966</a>, and others). has therefore been built into the MOSES firm model as an endogenous and explainable phenomenon.

First, corporate headquarters of firms never control the numerical structure of their production system, but manages it from a distance based on approximate knowledge and management pressure (see <a href=\"#bib18\">Eliasson, 1976a</a>). Since firms do not themselves use aggregate capital in their production planning, they cannot provide us with meaningful data. Second, K in a neoclassical production function is an aggregate that depends on the relative prices of products manufactured. When output composition changes such physical capital aggregates becomes unstable. Since market induced structural change is our main concern, neoclassical production capital becomes a useless concept. There is a reason for capital being a controversial concept in economic theory.",

Labor is homogenous, and the productivity of employed individual workers is determined by the productivity of the production equipment of the firm they work for. The spread of wages depends on the intensity of competition for workers, the diversity of firms\u2019 productivities and the state of information about wage offers. The labor market search in principle engages the entire labor force and involves several interactions between employers and workers during each period (quarter). Employment \u201ccontracts\u201d are settled whenever a firm and a worker have agreed, that is during quarters. Search each quarter is terminated after a preset number of wage offer rounds.

Hence, this block has been modelled in a way that gives a broad menu of choices as to further elaborations. <i>Fourth</i>, search processes are real economic phenomena. They require not only involved and intricate chains of program instructions, but also use up a lot of computer time. As computing capacity increases, they can therefore be both theoretically and empirically represented in ways not possible before.

Similarly, if we allow firms to raid the service and Government sector, those sectors might lose a major share of their labor force during a business upswing. So for the time being the interesting labor market dynamics occurs in the manufacturing industry, and the productivity of manufacturing workers depends on the productivity of the firms\u2019 production system, a specification that has been empirically reasonable for a long time, but increasingly less so in recent years. This specification will therefore have to be attended to in future to allow for different competence and skill levels of workers.",

Foreign prices are exogenous, but can also be endogenized if the exchange rate is endogenized. The rationale for the two export rate functions of course is the implicit assumption that labour productivity and wages in production for domestic and foreign markets are the same, implying in turn that production for export is more than a marginal busines for the firm. Even though quite traditional, especially when formulating macro export functions, we therefore have a problem modelling Swedish firms\u2019 export functions, especially when it comes to the large international corporations, the five largest of which deliver one third of their output in domestic markets, one third in foreign markets through their foreign subsidiaries and one third in the form of direct export deliveries from Swedish production units according to a recent study (<a href=\"#bib13\">Eliasson, 1971</a>) from my department at the Federation of Swedish Industries. The Planning Survey, on which the micro to macro model is based, is dominated by the large Swedish multinationals, but only covers their domestic production by division, and hence aggregates direct exports and deliveries to their foreign subsidiaries. While Swedish foreign subsidiaries are largely marketing organizations or engaged in late-stage modification of products for local markets, the international specialization of the production of the large firms is increasing. This fact will therefore soon have to be accounted for in the firm module. Currently data is lacking for such an extension, which is best done when the firm module is extended to integrate the divisions of the Planning Survey into complete corporate entities. Then the effects of organizational change on productivity can be made part of business innovation (see footnote 17). Soon data on the international operations of Swedish firms will also become available from a unique study under way at the IUI (<a href=\"#bib48\">Swedenborg, 1973</a>).",

Our formulation is OK for a firm that is mainly supported by domestic markets (e.g. a normal U.S. firm), and regards exports as a marginal operation. This is not so for the largest Swedish firms that have invested in developing a local presence in foreign markets. For many Swedish firms Sweden is in fact the marginal market, even though production is still mainly domestic, even though also that is rapidly changing towards international specialization (<a href=\"#bib13\">Eliasson, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Eliasson, 1972a</a>). For some of them equation (42) would perhaps be acceptable since bad margin performance in Sweden compared to elsewhere would tend to increase the export share. For most Swedish firms with export shares ranging between 30 and 70 per cent the problem is different. For them the export market is needed to support overall scale economics and efficiency. It is often rational for such a firm to operate with substantially reduced margins in the smaller markets, or during a long introduction phase, since the additional products corresponding to one market can be produced at very reduced unit costs. For them a large reduction in the export share might mean either a large increase in the domestic market share, or a serious problem. Unfortunately, we cannot model such relevant complexities at the present stage. One empirical requirement that we place on the model is, however, that individual firms generate reasonable export shares over time in simulations. Despite these considerations the simple formulation in equation (42) pinpoints the variables at work on a firm\u2019s export share, and it should be mentioned that we are making it difficult for us by avoiding common short-cuts such as basing export functions directly to an exogenously given foreign market growth rate.",

A shift in the direction of more financial assets means consolidating the liquidity position of the household. It is a timing device. It occurs (a) when the real return to financial assets increases and (b) when the job market goes recessive.

The second component in (<a href=\"#E60\">Equation 60</a>) tells how residual income (what is left) is allocated. Note that this residual income may be negative. The conventional approach by <a href=\"#bib47\">Stone (1954)</a> and his followers have been to use only BETA2 (a linear formulation). BETA2 divided by the share of total income allocated can then be interpreted as the income elasticity. As long as we stick to this formulation (i.e. SUM(BETA3)=0) we can draw directly on the empirical results of <a href=\"#bib30\">Klevmarken and Dahlman (1971)</a> with the qualification that they have excluded household saving in their linear income allocation model and assumed total disposable income to be income after tax less saving. By introducing BETA3 we have added a non-linear factor. The idea is that BETA3 is negative for spending categories that increase their share in the long run. As real income (DI/CPI) grows the second factor within brackets grows and the whole elasticity component within brackets [] increases. The problem with this variable elasticity approach is how to split <a href=\"#bib30\">Klevmarken and Dahlman (1971)</a> somewhat biased estimates on the time average of {BETA2(I)+ BETA3(I)\u2219CPI/DI} into BETA 2 and BETA3 coefficients.

It is a stylized version of the quarterly planning practice observed in large firms in <a href=\"#bib18\">Eliasson (1976a)</a>. This stylized version is, however, compatible with an immense number of detailed variations that we abstract from until we have decided when to introduce a micro version of the household sector. It is true, for instance, that large firms regularly begin budgeting and planning by predicting total market change, and then, given their competitive situation and price strategy, predict how large a share they will capture. This procedure is represented by the sales forecast in Section 2.3.1 from which production planning begins. A possible alternative production supply sequence of theoretical interest would be to begin with a strategic price expectation of what firm management think the market will absorb and then first compute a production plan with normal capacity utilization and supply the market with as much as is compatible with optimal inventories at the end of the quarter. The firm then checks for MIP profit target satisfaction, and when the necessary internal adjustments (including changing wages, recruiting, or laying off workers etc.) for profit target satisfaction have been concluded, it fixes the quarterly production plan and enters the market test as already in the model code. If we think this is empirically interesting, we could also make each firm engage each quarter in an internal short term profit maximizing exercise where strategic price expectations are matched with different production plans given existing short-term capacities to produce. It would also be technically straightforward, but demanding on computer capacity, to have firms overhaul their entire production plan after each new price vector has been fed back from t0he household interaction. The evidence from <a href=\"#bib18\">Eliasson (1976a)</a>, however, is that production plans tend to remain fixed during quarters.",
