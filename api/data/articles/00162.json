The descriptions in these chapters are quite theoretical, which is useful for persons who really want to apply them. For the person who just wants to read an overview, the summary comparisons in terms of required input, efficiency of the approach method and the outputs expected are very useful.",

It starts with an overview of common approaches such as iterative proportional fitting, repeated reweighting, simulated annealing and combinatorial optimization. The authors nicely describe the intuition behind each approach. However, as stated in Chapter 5, most conventional approaches do not take into account the fact that a finite population usually has two parts: observed and unobserved sampling units. The new Bayesian Prediction-Based Microdata Simulation approach aims to obtain a posterior distribution of unknown parameters for the total population. An interesting and promising approach that better incorporates potential threats of selection and response biases.",

The in-depth chapters show how valuable and rich the results from a microsimulation can be. Also Chapter 9, about validation and evaluation of the results, is very useful. Validation and evaluation is often a challenging but very important issue in microsimulation modelling which strongly adds to the reliability and trustworthiness of the results. The authors use the housing-stress results to demonstrate the Z-score test and the absolute standardizes residual estimate analysis (ASRE).",

Also, the chapters about the housing stress could benefit from more cross-references with the validation Chapter (9). When reading Chapters 6\u20138, no references are made, while Chapter 9 actually does evaluate the results of the simulation itself. Nevertheless, all in all, the book gives an extensive theoretical and empirical overview of different microsimulation techniques and can be of relevance to both starting and more experienced researchers who want to expand their knowledges on ways to estimate small area characteristics.",
