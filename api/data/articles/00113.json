This paper makes the argument that, even though the two methods are technically completely different, they are not unlike in terms of their simulation properties. Starting from the thesis that under theoretical circumstances, both approaches are equivalent in terms of their simulation properties, the choice between the two archetypes of models comes down to assessing how far the actual and theoretical circumstances differ from each other. By highlighting the differences and resemblances between static and dynamic microsimulations in terms of their simulation properties, this short note will contribute to the debate in choosing between these two types of models, and can thus serve as an advice piece for someone contemplating the development of a microsimulation model.",

The GREGWT algorithm, developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) for spatial microsimulation, is used to reweight surveys to Australia wide and capital city benchmarks. NATSEM uses it for its SpatialMSM model (See <a href=\"#bib23\">Tanton &amp; Vidyattama, 2011</a>).

The data load of these models is considerably heavier than the one for models with static ageing. Since the states over time are interconnected in models with dynamic ageing, the data generating process is also more complicated than in the case of static ageing. In the latter case one lays down a predefined final distribution where the data are aligned with<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup>. In dynamic ageing one also models some processes that generate the final distribution, like who marries whom or who gives birth to how many children.

Though it is technically possible, this simulation of lifetime income is problematic in models with static ageing. First of all, and contrary to dynamic ageing models, it is conceptually meaningless to add up the incomes of the same individual in two years. This is because the observed individual represents two different individuals in two subsequent years. An individual observed with age 50 in the starting dataset of the year 2000 can be brought to, say, 2020 using static ageing techniques. But then the same individual represents an individual who is 50 in 2020, and who therefore was only 30 years of age in 2000.

This would conceptually be possible but technically meaningless as one wants to simulate lifetime incomes to get rid of cross-sectional variation in earnings. However, by this approach one in fact introduces cross-sectional variation in the construction of lifetime income, since the incomes of subsequent observed cohorts \u2013 albeit reweighed and uprated- are added up. So the resulting lifetime incomes will not be better than the cross-sectional incomes. They both will suffer from cross-sectional variation so that their added value is limited. As static ageing models cannot produce credible estimates of lifetime income, the comparison will thus necessarily be limited to cross-sectional results for single years.",

Models with dynamic ageing change the characteristics of the individuals in the dataset and do not consider the weights. In ideal circumstances, both models may be equivalent in the output they produce and in the range of policy assessments they can handle. This potential equivalence can be shown by a simple experiment of thought. Suppose a model with dynamic ageing that simulates all <i>n</i> individuals from a base-dataset in the year <i>x</i> to the future year y, and suppose that individuals are described by a limited number of <i>v</i> variables. Then one can always find a joint <i>n</i> \u00d7 <i>v</i> reweighting matrix by confronting the simulated dataset at <i>y</i> with the base-data at <i>x</i><sup><a href=\"#fn4\">4</a></sup>. So, under these ideal circumstances, a model with static ageing can replicate the dataset <i>y</i> created by the model with dynamic ageing, by reweighting <i>x</i>. Restated in the terminology of this paper: under ideal circumstances, the simulation properties of both models are the same, even though their technical characteristics are very different.

In other words, if a model is to reweigh an individual to represent future individual(s), the individual should exist in the starting dataset in the first place. If this is not the case, then the reweighting procedure will fail. A first and most obvious reason for specific individuals not being present in the starting dataset is that they should be there, but, due to sampling error, are not. Another reason might be that they should not even be present in the base dataset. Indeed, it seems imaginable that behaviour has changed in such a way that those combinations of variables that may arise in the future do not exist today. This becomes clear with an obvious retrospective sample. Today, plenty of people of all age-categories cohabit without being married. This is something which has arisen during the last decades. If one would have used a dataset of \u2013 say- 1950, one might not have found cohabiting individuals. Immigration may also bring individuals with unprecedented characteristics into a country.

Thus, current earnings in any year <i>t</i> &lt; <i>y</i> become retrospective earnings in <i>t</i> + 1 \u2264 <i>y</i> and pension benefits are calculated for those entering retirement. Assuming that the relation between the fundamental variables (such as age and gender) and career variables (earnings, employment) remains unchanged, this makes models with dynamic ageing less vulnerable for one-shot events<sup><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup>.

These models therefore do not allow for the simulation of Bismarckian changes, and ignore the impact of past one shot events<sup><a href=\"#fn6\">6</a></sup>. But there is a straightforward solution for the first source of bias: if the starting dataset does include retrospective information tied to these observed benefits, one can use a static microsimulation model to change the way in which past earnings affect current pensions, and use static ageing techniques to bring the current simulation results into the future. A combination of a static model and static ageing techniques therefore does the trick. First, one uses uprating to bring individual earnings as well as the parameters of the pension system to the future year. Next, one uses the static model (including uprated parameters and the necessary technical changes) to replace the currently observed pension benefits by uprated-simulated pension benefits. Finally, the sample is reweighted to take into account demographic and/or labour market trends between today and the future year. Note that the uprating-reweighting order is important here, because if uprating is not applied before the static model, then the combination cannot take into account the impact of differences between the development of earnings and the parameters of the pension system; a key element in the development of pension inequality (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dekkers, 2014</a>)<sup><a href=\"#fn7\">7</a></sup>.",
