The papers all discuss the development and application to policy of dedicated health microsimulation models. These models and applications are testimony to the realisation of Orcutt\u2019s original vision in the late 1950\u2019s and early 1960\u2019s of applying microsimulation techniques to socio-economic modelling, expanding from the earlier focus on taxation and public transfers into the areas of health and ageing.",

However, these models are much more complex in their handling of health, disability, aspects of countries\u2019 health and aged care systems, or the evaluation of treatment options. They are challenging to develop as they have much greater health data requirements than seen in the general purpose microsimulation models (<a href=\"#bib1\">Lymer, 2011</a>). However, they offer policy-makers many advantages over traditional policy evaluation methods including being able to account for issues such as population heterogeneity, multiple outcomes, spill-overs and externalities, and the capacity to capture long run effects (either through the use of static ageing processes or dynamic modelling) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Zucchelli et al, 2010</a>).",

Health&WealthMOD is a dedicated model of health and illness and their impacts on labour force participation, income, wealth and government revenue and expenditure in Australia. It is designed to determine the economic impacts of disease on older workers aged 45 to 65 years. In the first of these papers, the architecture and methods in the development of Health&WealthMOD (Version II) are outlined. The second paper reports an application of the model in projecting the impacts of increasing prevalence of long term chronic illness and population ageing on labour force participation in 2020, with a particular focus on trends in retirement. Retaining mature-aged workers within the labour force is an issue that many countries are currently grappling with.",

Statistics Canada is well known for its microsimulation models, especially LifePaths and POHEM. L\u00e9gar\u00e9 and D\u00e9carie use the dynamic LifePaths model to project the disability status of older Canadians. As L\u00e9gar\u00e9 and D\u00e9carie comment disability is a key variable in determining the need for aged care but it is an intricate one. Using new disability status transitions, they present projections of future Canadian elderly by disability status and provide a comparison with nine European countries from the Future Elderly Living Conditions in Europe (FELICIE) Research Program.",

The paper by Walker and Colagiuri outlines methodological and technical proposals for the development of a cost-benefit model-system. Walker and Colagiuri take an approach that aims to link several chronic disease progression models to an \u2018Umbrella\u2019 microsimulation model representing the Australian population, with the view to projecting 20 years ahead. The model-system will account simultaneously for Australians\u2019 demographic, socioeconomic and health-risk-factor characteristics; progression of their health status; the number of chronic diseases (comorbidities) they accumulate over time; health-related expenditures; and changes in quality of life. Standard economic methods are then proposed to estimate cost-effectiveness of simulated policy interventions and related quality of life improvements.",

Their \u2018Diabetes Model\u2019 projects the number of adult Australians who are expected to have pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes over a 45 year simulation period. The model simulates control of type 2 diabetes in terms of glycaemic levels, cholesterol levels, weight and blood pressure control, and estimates the number and cost of complications associated with the disorder. As with the previous models, the Diabetes Model also provides the capacity to quantify the effect of hypothetical public health initiatives in the management of type 2 diabetes and associated trends in risk factor prevalence and diabetes control over the simulation period. Unlike the other models, however, the model builders have used a unique mixed methods approach with microsimulation modelling of unit record demographic and risk factor data underpinning group-based disease outcome analyses.",
