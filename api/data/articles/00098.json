The first paper by Matteo Richiardi and Ambra Poggi however shows the important consequences of this omission, and \u2013fortunately-also presents an ingenious algorithm for assigning individual effects to the simulation sample.",

The paper develops a basic general VAT-MSM, and illustrates it by applying to Germany. That way, the paper discusses the distributional and fiscal effects of the German VAT. Finally, the effects of a small VAT reform, comparing static and behavioural response simulations, are presented.",

Also of interest in this paper is the synthetic matching process that allows multiple unit records of the Australian Bureau of Statistics\u2019 Surveys of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC) to be synthetically matched with one APPSIM unit record based on the closest matching record.",

The objective of FPOP is to provide a demographically realistic projection of the size, structure, and movement of populations and households decades into the future. FPOP is the demographic core of an extensible modeling framework, which in turn enables the geospatial projection of a population under purely demographic processes or under the additional influence of exogenous factors such as disease, policy changes and prevention programs, or environmental stressors. An interesting feature of FPOP is that it allows for dynamically-interactive links with external models. This is demonstrated by applying the model first under purely demographic processes and then in conjunction with an external disease model of obesity.",

This I of course do in coordination with the board of the International Microsimulation Association. A recent change is that Jinjing Li (NATSEM, University of Canberra) has kindly agree to become Assistant Editor, while Eveline van Leeuwen (VU University Amsterdam) has taken up the position of Book Review Editor. I am glad they are on board and I look forward to working with them to make the International Journal of Microsimulation a success.",
