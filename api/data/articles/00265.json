                "text": "Mitochondrial diseases (MITO) are serious and debilitating conditions, often multisystemic and requiring life-long monitoring and treatment of symptoms to reduce the risk of a life-threatening episode or acute illness. The disease is caused by mutations either in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA (nDNA), resulting in impaired production of cellular energy from the affected mitochondrial organelles. MITO closely resembles other conditions due to its wide clinical presentation and genetic heterogeneity. While mitochondrial diseases are relatively common serious conditions with likely large medical and social costs to patients, carers and government, there is no microsimulation model of the impacts of this condition. Further, there is relatively little data on the medical costs of mitochondrial diseases and almost no data on social costs. What data there is on health costs has serious limitations and costs may be significantly underestimated. We aim to address this gap with the development of a microsimulation model called MitoMOD to estimate the costs of mitochondrial diseases using a cohort of clinically diagnosed adult patients with mitochondrial diseases as the base population. In this paper, we describe the construction of MitoMOD which is designed to capture economic impacts on adults clinically diagnosed with mitochondrial diseases, their carer and government. To date, this is the first microsimulation model of its kind.",

MITO typically affects organs that have high energy demands such as the brain, liver, endocrine pancreas, skeletal muscles and the heart (<a href=\"#bib2\">Martikainen and Chinnery, 2015</a>). Depending on the number and type of organ(s) affected, the clinical manifestation of MITO can vary among patients (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alston et al., 2021</a>). Patients may also experience non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue or exercise intolerance, along with more defined symptoms such as seizures, stroke-like events, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, deafness and blindness (<a href=\"#bib4\">Krieg et al., 2016</a>). In adults, MITO is often a progressive multisystem disorder, with frequent and long-term monitoring and treatment of symptoms needed to reduce the risk of an acute illness or life-threatening episode (<a href=\"#bib5\">Mattman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Sue, 2010</a>). MITO is often misdiagnosed or misinterpreted as the clinical features closely resemble other diseases, making it a challenge for clinicians to diagnose (<a href=\"#bib2\">Martikainen and Chinnery, 2015</a>). In a study of 210 MITO patients, 55% received an alternative diagnosis before receiving the final definitive diagnosis of MITO and out of these 55%, 32% were misdiagnosed more than once (<a href=\"#bib7\">Grier et al., 2018</a>). The participants in this study report seeking eight different physicians, on average, before receiving the correct diagnosis of MITO (<a href=\"#bib7\">Grier et al., 2018</a>). Investigating family history of an inherited condition may not be a reliable guide as MITO can occur <i>de novo</i> in the maternal germline, giving rise to a sporadic disease (<a href=\"#bib2\">Martikainen and Chinnery, 2015</a>). There is no known cure for MITO (<a href=\"#bib7\">Grier et al., 2018</a>).",

For example, given that most cases of MITO are often misdiagnosed, with diagnosis typically occurring only after a long diagnostic odyssey, MITO is typically not included in national population health surveys. There are a small number of studies reporting health costs for MITO, but these generally do not cover the full range of health costs, do not include social costs and are not robust in terms of their clinical diagnosis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Cohen et al. (2018)</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">McCormack et al. (2017)</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Buajitti et al. (2022)</a>). Thus, the authors note significant limitations. ICD-9 codes used do not capture all disease subtypes and patients with other disorders may be misclassified as having a diagnosis of MITO (<a href=\"#bib1\">Cohen et al. (2018)</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">McCormack et al. (2017)</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Buajitti et al. (2022)</a>. Conversely, because the choice of the ICD terminology does not require a high level of clinical certainty that a patient has MITO, there could be patients included in the database that were suspected of having MITO but never had the clinical evidence to justify that choice of the specific ICD codes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Cohen et al. (2018)</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">McCormack et al. (2017)</a>). Advances in recognising MITO phenotypes and genotypes identified using whole genome sequencing (WGS) has led to the number of MITO variants identified recently increasing exponentially (<a href=\"#bib17\">Schon et al., 2020</a>). However, for most families and affected individuals, WGS remains expensive and limited in availability (<a href=\"#bib17\">Schon et al., 2020</a>) and thus data including a molecular diagnosis are generally not readily available.",

In addition to the diagnostic support, one of the clinic\u2019s primary areas of research is MITO. Participants were invited into our study during their routine visit to the clinic. Each participant, including their carer, if applicable, that consented to the study were asked to complete a questionnaire. The questionnaire was administered by our genetic counsellor or MITO researchers either through a phone call or face-to-face session. The questionnaire covered an extensive array of topics such as information about their primary residence, employment history, employment status, reliance on transfer payments (welfare payments, benefits and allowances), utilisation of health services and treatments (including complimentary health services and treatments, special remedies and diets, non-prescription pharmaceutical drugs), respite care, savings and assets, and use of assistive technologies and modifications to the house or car, and health status (such as for mental health disorders that include depression, nervous tension/stress, anxiety, phobias, psychosis, dementia and attention deficit disorder/hyperactivity). Data on hospitalisations, use of prescribed medicines and medical services and treatments from the participants in our study were linked into the model. The quality of life among the study participants and carers were assessed using the AQoL-8D instrument. Other assessments include the level of connectedness to others from the participants in our study and the level of relationship satisfaction among those that are partnered.",

These matching variables were chosen as they are associated with income but unlikely or unable to be altered by adult-onset MITO. Each participant in our study were matched to 1000 counterfactual records with similar demographic characteristics in STINMOD+ using unrestrictive random sampling method (i.e. sampling with replacement), generating 1000 counterfactual datasets. Lost income is then estimated by finding the difference between the counterfactual income and the current income the participant in our study receives. The distribution of mean lost income based on 1000 counterfactual datasets was analysed and the 95% uncertainty intervals were estimated based on the percentile method.

We took a broad perspective anticipating a large range of economic and social impacts of MITO occurring at the patient, family, health service, and whole-of-government level. Our microsimulation model can be used in future studies to report the health and social costs of MITO and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of whole genome sequencing (WGS) compared to current diagnostic tests.",
