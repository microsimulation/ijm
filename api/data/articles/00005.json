These issues identified via an in-depth review of seven dynamic microsimulation models, selected from an initial set of 27 models in order to highlight the main differences in approaches and modelling options currently adopted. After presenting a brief description of each of the seven selected models, the main modelling approaches are summarized and critically appraised using five main distinguishing criteria. These criteria are the use of alignment techniques, model complexity (as reflected in the range of variables used), theoretical foundations, type of starting population, and the extent and detail of financial issues covered. Building upon this appraisal, the paper goes on to show how the \u201812 SAGE lessons\u2019 apply in the field of health care microsimulation. The trade-off between complexity and predictive power is shown to be key. Finally an appendix summarises the main features of all 27 of the dynamic microsimulation models originally surveyed.",

In some cases these reviews have been undertaken to draw and document lessons from existing microsimulation models as a first step towards new model development. (E.g. for FAMSIM+: <a href=\"#bib40\">Spielauer, 2003</a>; SAGE: <a href=\"#bib55\">Zaidi and Rake, 2001</a>; APPSIM: <a href=\"#bib7\">Cassells <i>et al</i>., 2006</a>). The purpose of this paper is to capitalize on the expertise acquired by what is now four decades of dynamic microsimulation model development with regard to modelling health care demand, health care finance and the economic impact of health behaviour. Based on an extensive literature search, 27 dynamic microsimulation projects were identified for which documentation is available. A short description and classification of all 27 of these projects is given in the appendix of this report. Seven projects are reviewed in more detail: DYNASIM, CORSIM, DYNAMOD, LifePaths, MOSART, and NCCSO. All of these seven models include health-related variables. However, the range of health-related issues that can be studied using these models varies widely, as health is not the central focus of the majority of the models. Consequently, this review does not exclusively concentrate on the treatment of health issues in microsimulation. Rather, the selection of models was made with the intention of reviewing key differences in approach towards dynamic microsimulation, thereby raising generic issues believed to be of direct relevance to health modelling. After providing a brief description of each of the selected models, this paper summarizes and critically appraises their modelling approaches using five distinguishing criteria. These are the use of alignment techniques, the model\u2019s complexity and range of variables used, the theoretical foundation of the model, the type of starting population used, and the extent and detail of financial issues covered.",

It was Orcutt who first proposed the concept of developing dynamic microsimulation in social sciences in 1957. Microsimulation was intended to serve as a social science research tool capable of mimicking natural experiments in economics and as a framework for integrating economic and sociological research. The early model was used to analyze Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Unemployment Insurance issues and to develop long-range projections of earning histories for the analysis of social security issues (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson, 1997</a>).",

More controversially, CORSIM makes heavy use of alignment techniques to recalibrate its \u2018projections\u2019 for past years to published data. For future years, time series trends in historic alignment factors are rolled forward in order to develop alignment factors for future years. This approach makes projections into the future difficult to interpret, or, as Anderson (<a href=\"#bib1\">1997</a>: [5]19) states, \u201cwithout realigning or rebasing the data for a recent historic year, projections of future years may begin from a base that already is subject to errors accumulated over a 35 year simulation period\u201d.

In its first version, developed between 1988 and 1990, MOSART focused on demographic behaviour, education and labour force participation in order to study the impact of demographic change on labour force and education attainment. A second version extended the model to include the modelling of pensions. Currently MOSART is in a third version that includes more detailed behavioural modules of household formation and disability. MOSART is mostly based upon a set of administrative data and records representing 12% of the Norwegian population. The detailed administrative data available in Norway allowed for a construction of a longitudinal database that contains rich retrospective information on many variables dating back to 1985, and to 1967 for labour income and pension entitlement.",

Many models, like DYNASIM, CORSIM and its various successors, make heavy use of alignment methods in order to align the model\u2019s aggregate projections to external forecasts (or to historic numbers if simulation starts in the past). The latter is the case, for example in COSRSIM, that still uses a 1960s population sample as its starting population. Over the years, time series of adjustment factors were added and, in order to use the model for forecasts, research has concentrated rather on the prediction of alignment factors from this time series data than on changing the model (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson, 1997</a>). In the context of aligned outputs, the \u2018internal\u2019 behavioural equations are therefore used to illustrate the socio-structural effects and distributions of events across socio-demographic groups, while the aggregate results are aligned to external forecasts. There are various reasons for pursuing this approach. The first is \u2018specification randomness\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Van Imhoff &amp; Post, 1998</a>). The greater the number of explanatory variables for a given attribute or event, the less statistically robust the associated empirical estimate of the predictor function. Specification randomness reduces the aggregate prediction power of a model (in a trade-off against misspecification errors due to the omission of important variables). A way out of this dilemma is frequently seen in the alignment of detailed micro-models to macro-models, which are believed to have a higher predictive power. But the reason for aligning outputs does not always lie in the lack of trust in the model predictions; it can also result from the demands of policy makers who are interested in \u2018what if studies\u2019, the \u2018if\u2019 being the aggregate output the model is expected to reproduce. A typical example is \u2018official central scenario\u2019 population forecasts. In this respect, the alignment of outcomes is also needed and used to make model results comparable to other modelling approaches by using the same population scenario. As a result of these pressures, alignment methods have also been incorporated into microsimulation models which had initially not been planned to follow this road \u2013 the Australian DYNAMOD being a good example. Less complex models, like MOSART, are able to reproduce pre-set scenarios more easily as they apply methods and variables that come closer to conventional cell-based macro models. Thus they can \u2018internally\u2019 reproduce given scenarios by corresponding parameterization.",

While models that are based on rather simple behavioural models are often more likely to reproduce \u2018trusted\u2019 aggregate projections, they are not only rather weak with regard to explanation, but also limit the analysis of behaviour to this reduced set of variables. Simple models do not allow for the inclusion of many of the socio-economic variables regarded as important in the modelling of health behaviour. As the excluded socio-economic characteristics must therefore be assumed independently of health, these models might produce quite biased joint distributions when these additional characteristics are included into the analyses. This is especially a problem in tax-benefit and health care finance analyses, since health is highly related with a series of other socioeconomic variables including education and income. This might not be a problem for forecasts in the short term if the base population comes from a recent representative sample, but it generates a trade-off between good aggregate predictions and a good prediction concerning distributional issues in the long run. This leads back to the heavy reliance on alignment techniques as used in the models mainly built for policy analysis like CORSIM, DYNACAN or DYNAMOD. In this respect, the NCCSO model represents the \u2018extreme case\u2019 of specialization, as it entirely concentrates on the projection of income and wealth distribution of pensioners (used for the means test of care policies), but leaves the modelling of population numbers by age and care need to a cell-based macro-model which the results of the microsimulation model are fed into.",

This topic is closely related to the intended use of a model \u2013 prediction versus explanation \u2013 as a good theoretical foundation usually does not go hand-in-hand with the predictive power of a model. Discrete time models typically use either transition tables or (usually logistic) regression models. All of these models can be regarded as typical \u201cblackbox\u201d models, as, apart from the selection of appropriate explanatory variables, little or no theoretical foundation is given. LifePaths deviates from this approach, as it introduces more \u2018behaviour\u2019 in its modelling of fertility which is modelled as a sequence of fertility decisions, as distinguished from the statistical modelling of the waiting time until birth after a decision was made. This might be a very useful departure point in order to introduce agent-based behaviour, such as goal orientation, and explicit models of decision making into microsimulation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Vencataswawmy, 2002</a>). Generally, the inclusion of explicit behaviour is supported by time-frameworks that avoid reliance solely upon transition models. The Australian DYNAMOD model gives a very interesting example in this respect. With its pseudo-continuous time framework (of monthly steps) and the ability to store future events (in what is called the \u201ccrystal ball\u201d), whose effective occurrence might be reassessed as circumstances change, a variety of ways of modelling behaviour are opened up. This, of course, holds true also for continuous time models like LifePaths and POHEM.",

Microsimulation in this respect can also serve as tool to \u2018restore the past\u2019.

This is definitely true also for microsimulation applied in health care studies, as are the following and last two lessons, the first highlighting the necessity for thorough and clear model documentation and the last specifying the need for a computing strategy \u201cto be developed alongside the microsimulation strategy.\u201d In this respect, LifePaths clearly distinguishes itself, as the development of this model drove the development of the microsimulation language Modgen (<a href=\"#bib42\">Statistics Canada, 2007</a>). Subsequently, Modgen has grown into a generic microsimulation language (technically a superset of the C++ programming language) supporting most modelling approaches, including continuous and discrete time models as well as case-based and time-based models.

The surveyed models differ considerably in scope, complexity, comprehensiveness, theoretical foundation and predictive power, as well as in accounting detail. None capture fully all aspects of health care, which include both demand (disease burden and progression) and supply (the financing and provision of health care). Key differences in approach centre around the use of alignment techniques, model complexity (range of variables used), theoretical foundation, the type of starting population and the extent and detail of financial issues covered.",

It has been noted that \u2018large\u2019 and \u2018general\u2019 models, such as DYNASIM and its successors, make heavy use of alignment methods. More specialized models developed and designed for the study of demographic and health-related processes, such as LIFEMOD and POHEM, differ considerably from these general models with regard to the types of behavioural models used, the treatment of time and the underlying data. The application of the 12 \u2018SAGE lessons\u2019 to the problem of modelling health care reinforces the importance and nature of this trade-off, highlighting in addition the need for model modularity and the adoption of an appropriate time-frame. The ideal microsimulation health care model remains to be created, but between them the approaches adopted by POHEM and DYNAMOD perhaps offer the best clues for the way forward.",

CBOLT is used to analyze how sensitive theses programs are to demographic, economic, and behavioural assumptions. The model is designed to examine the effects of various federal budget policy options, such as alternative Social Security tax and benefit rules, Medicare eligibility and cost growth assumptions but also to simulate the effects of various fundamental policy changes such as private accounts, trust fund investment.</td>\n<td>Continuous Wage History Survey (SSA) and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Studies (CMS)</td>\n<td>discrete</td>\n<td>closed</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.cbolt.com\">http://www.cbolt.com</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CORSIM</td>\n<td>US \u2013 Cornell University; Strategic Forecasting</td>\n<td>The Cornell Dynamic Population Microsimulation Model (CORSIM) started its development at Cornell University (U.S) in 1987.
