We analyze the effects of the 2016 Austrian tax reform <i>ex ante</i> and concentrate on the effects on the distribution of net income and on work incentives. Our results show that the changes to the tax brackets have slightly increased inequality, and the middle- and high-income earners profited most. This effect has been significantly lowered by an increase in the negative income tax for low-income earners. By calculating average effective tax rates (AETRs) as well as marginal effective tax rates (METRs) along the whole income distribution in our model, we discuss changes on work incentives on the extensive but also on the intensive margin. We show that the 2016 tax reform positively affected the work incentives on the extensive and the intensive margin for higher income groups. The additional change in the negative income tax had only an impact on the extensive margin of low-income earners. These low-income earners are usually part-time workers, therefore giving a higher incentive to work part-time but no additional incentive to increase working hours. We show that a decrease in social security contributions instead of an increase in the negative income tax for low-income earners would lead to an increase in both the extensive and the intensive margin.",

That is especially important when one analyzes distributional effects. Moreover, as shown in detail later on, survey data do not often correlate well with the actual tax receipts at the lower end of the income distribution, and are therefore of limited use when it comes to analyzing work incentives for low-wage earners. This problem is overcome by using the administrative data.",

It is therefore clear that AUTAX should be seen as an additional tool to validate results from the already existing tax-benefit models regarding data issues. As we will demonstrate later, AUTAX, as well as the other tax-benefit models, face data and implementation difficulties. For policy analysis in Austria, a tax-benefit model based on administrative data such as AUTAX does not exist. The possibility of comparing results from microsimulation based on administrative as well as survey data might help to identify data problems.",

The negative income tax can be considered a transfer that was introduced to adjust/reduce the social security contribution burden for low-income earners. The negative income tax is also not directly included in the tax system: the individual has to apply for this transfer via a yearly tax declaration. Until 2014, an individual with low income and social security contributions was eligible for 10% of his or her social security contributions (with a maximum of EUR 110 and pensioners were not eligible) as a transfer. In 2015, 20% of social security contribution (with a maximum of EUR 220 and EUR 55 for pensioners) could be received back as negative income tax. This was further increased in 2016 to 50% of social security contributions (with a maximum of EUR 400 and EUR 110 for pensioners). The idea behind this policy tool is to reduce the tax burden for low-income earners who do not pay income tax and are therefore not influenced by the changes in the tax rates and the tax brackets. <a href=\"#bib33\">Schratzenstaller <i>et al</i>.

In absolute, as well as relative terms, men profited more than women.

Our analysis shows that this increase stems mainly from the fact that income inequality between the wage taxpayers and non-taxpayers increased, while inequality within these two groups reduced. The reform decreased the tax burden, but many wage-income earners in Austria are not paying any wage taxes due to their low incomes.

                    "text": "While both policies lead to higher-wage incomes for lower-wage income earners, our analysis shows that the two policies influence work incentives differently. While the tax reform has increased work incentives on both the extensive and the intensive margins for taxpayers, the negative income tax only had an impact on the intensive margin of low-income earners. The low-income earners are more often part-time workers and the reform therefore provides a higher incentive to work part-time and no additional incentive to increase working hours. If the goal of the policy-makers is to increase the net incomes and incentives to work for people that work full-time, there is no doubt that a decrease in the social security contributions is more effective than an increase in the negative income tax, which makes part-time work and marginal employment more attractive.",
