There have been a number of recent surveys of \u201cmainstream\u201d spatial microsimulation models and associated methodologies. The contribution of this paper relates mainly in extending these surveys by considering other micro based simulation models that incorporate a spatial or geographic dimension. We feel this is important as in many areas of microsimulation modelling, there are parallel literatures that have developed that apply simulation techniques to micro units that are not labelled microsimulation or in the case of the papers reviewed in this paper not labelled spatial microsimulation. The paper reviews a number of different application areas of spatially focused microsimulation models, including demography, welfare, health, regional development, transport planning, agri-environmental analysis, crisis planning, land use and planning. We also review a number of the methodological choices made by modellers including scope, and spatial disaggregation, data sources, data creation methodology, validation and calibration and simulating change.",

The ability to create robust micro-level data offered a powerful alternative to the expense and time of assembling of\ufb01cial microdata sets, such as published micro-level census records or individual/household survey data. This is especially true for models that wished to include spatial referencing. One might speculate that spatial microsimulation is too demanding or that microsimulation models are niche products or dubious black box models, applicable only with caution where other methods are not available. However, as the geographical impact of government policies, public and private investment and social networks becomes increasingly evident (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ballas &amp; Clarke, 2009</a>), researchers increasingly recognise that spatial microsimulation is an important research tool (<a href=\"#bib126\">Morrissey <i>et al</i>., 2014</a>).

A decade later, <a href=\"#bib62\">H\u00e4gerstrand (1967)</a> again employed micro-analytical techniques to study the spatial diffusion of innovation. <a href=\"#bib191\">Wilson and Pownall (1976)</a> continued H\u00e4gerstrand\u2019s work by suggesting a new spatial modelling framework to represent the urban system based on the micro-level interdependence of household and individual characteristics. Further, they concentrated on the spatial distribution of a population and its activities and suggested that persons and their associated attributes should be defined separately in the form of lists, rather than represented in the form of matrices. In this manner, there is no loss of information and the storage is computationally efficient. In their representational framework, they were interested in estimating all the characteristics of the individuals that comprise the urban population.",

In particular, they considered the representation of household dynamics in an effort to design models for labour market and housing systems in the Yorkshire and Humberside regions in the early 1980s. They pointed out that the heterogeneous nature of households must be fully understood if the various processes governing their responses to change were to be modelled. Further work by <a href=\"#bib42\">Clarke <i>et al</i>., (1980)</a> discussed the potential for the application of spatial microsimulation modelling to analyse socio-economic and public policies by addressing a series of important questions of practical and theoretical nature drawn from urban and regional planning. These examples included the analysis of transportation policies, housing expenditure and finance. In particular, <a href=\"#bib42\">Clarke <i>et al</i>., (1980)</a> formulated a Monte Carlo based framework for transportation modelling at the micro-level. This framework stressed the importance of demographic, social and activity attributes of driver and passengers in determining whether individuals who have applied to a car-pooling scheme would in fact share a ride. Other early work in the field was the Harvard Urban Development Model, (<a href=\"#bib89\">Kain &amp; Apgar, 1985</a>) which aimed to simulate housing and neighbourhood improvement. <a href=\"#bib27\">Birkin and Clarke (1988)</a> laid the groundwork for the suite of models developed at the University of Leeds (<a href=\"#bib133\">O\u2019Donoghue <i>et al</i>., 2012</a>).",

However, over the years, parallel literatures have been developed that apply simulation techniques to micro units that are not labelled microsimulation or in the case of the papers reviewed in this not labelled spatial microsimulation.

This model predicts changes in travel behaviour following changes in the travel environment. The model is a tour based model rather than a trip based model in that it models joined up sets of journeys rather than simply single independent trips. It contains five components: (a) a Baseline Analyzer to ensure baseline diary is complete, (b) a Response Option Generator which models the preferred behavioural response to a change in the travel environment, (c) an Activity-Travel Planner Pattern Modifier which models the simulate possible changed travel patterns, (d) an Evaluation Routine that assesses the impact of the change as a function of time based utility and (e) an Acceptance Routine is the decision routine that determines the optimal travel decision.

They argued that a new generation of travel models had emerged, which required more detailed information on household demographics and employment characteristics at the small area level. They also pointed to new neighbourhood-scale transport policies aimed at promoting public transport, walking and cycling and the need for environmentally sustainable land use policies with regard to transportation. These policies required detailed information on the precise location of the population and its activities. <a href=\"#bib189\">Wegener and Spiekermann (1996)</a> also point to the need for urban models to forecast the environmental impacts as well as the economic impacts of land-use transport policies.

Related to this work, the ILUMASS modelling system in Dortmund, Germany (<a href=\"#bib158\">Strauch <i>et al</i>. 2005</a>) has been constructed with the aim to incorporate \u201cchanges of land use, the resulting changes in activity behaviour and in transport demand, and the impacts of transport and land use on the environment\u201d.",

These dimensions can be divided into the spatial scope and spatial disaggregation of the model. With regard to spatial scope, this may vary from a village (<a href=\"#bib99\">Kuiper &amp; Ruben, 2006</a>) or farm (<a href=\"#bib105\">Lindgren &amp; Elmquist, 2005</a>) to a city (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ballas &amp; Clarke, 2001a</a>) to a country (<a href=\"#bib64\">Harding <i>et al</i>., 2006</a>) to a continent as in the case of the EU comparative tax-benefit microsimulation model EUROMOD (<a href=\"#bib85\">Immervoll <i>et al</i>., 1999</a>). The relevant scope will depend upon the user and use of the model and may be constrained by the complexity associated with the methodology. Spatial disaggregation refers to the nature of the spatial levels within the model. This can vary in decreasing size from country in EUROMOD to a region in an inter-regional analysis (<a href=\"#bib108\">Lloyd <i>et al</i>., 2000</a>), to spatial districts (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ballas &amp; Clarke, 2001a</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Chin <i>et al</i>., 2005</a>) to spatial coordinates (<a href=\"#bib45\">Cullinan <i>et al</i>., 2011</a>).

Those coming from a social policy origin such as <a href=\"#bib65\">Harding <i>et al</i>. (2009)</a> and Tanton <i>et al</i>., (2011) in Australia and <a href=\"#bib134\">O\u2019Donoghue <i>et al</i>., (2013a)</a> in Ireland have a national scope, reflecting their (primarily) national government stakeholders. In contrast, the University of Leeds based group have focused on city based models, reflecting the history of planning and the local government stakeholders. In general the spatial disaggregation has tended to be district or zone level. In terms of planning purposes, there is little added value and very little data availability for going to a building level analysis. A similar divide in spatial scope exists with regard to policy applications. Models of the retail, transport and regional development tend to utilise a city focus. However, in contrast, some agri-environmental based models utilise a national level unit of analysis (<a href=\"#bib81\">Hynes, <i>et al</i>., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">2009b</a>). Indeed, research has indicated that the choice of spatial resolution or level of disaggregation can be important. <a href=\"#bib21\">Benenson (2007)</a> showed that when using a finer resolution than the \u201ctrue\u201d resolution in environmental analysis, one can result in different conclusions. For example where the impact of pollutants is non-linearly related to concentration, particularly spatial concentration, then a smaller resolution may understate the significance. Sometimes the scope and resolution is very small when one is interested in site specific phenomena such as the model of walking trails on biodiversity in parkland (<a href=\"#bib22\">Bennett <i>et al</i>., 2009</a>). Finally, whilst a division has been observed, it is important to note that it may exist because the desired spatial disaggregation is not available within the data. For example <a href=\"#bib57\">Felsenstein <i>et al</i>. (2007)</a> in using Urbansim to create a grid based model for Tel Aviv only had zonal data and assumed a uniform distribution across the zone to populate grids. While this may approximate reality in an urban area, it is not the case in rural analyses as identified in <a href=\"#bib44\">Cullinan <i>et al</i>., (2008)</a>.",

While it is rare for datasets to be created specifically for modelling purposes, datasets collected for other administrative or scientific purposes are usually used to develop models. An example is the use of a 100% sample of micro data geo-referenced to small areas used in the SVERIGE model, (<a href=\"#bib178\">Vencatasawmy <i>et al</i>., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Holm <i>et al</i>., 1996</a>). The ASTRID database used by the model includes detailed information of Swedish individuals, companies and properties for the period 1985\u20132003, spatially defined to 100 m2 and census data every five years from 1960 until 1990. Statistics Sweden (SCB) collects this data and SMC has been entitled to use those data for research purposes. An example of another full scope environmental spatial dataset used for spatial microsimulation is the National Resources Inventory used by <a href=\"#bib143\">Potter <i>et al</i>. (2009)</a>. However in most cases a single dataset is usually not available. For example while income surveys that are typically used in static microsimulation models have good income and socio-economic information at a micro level, sufficient for policy analysis, their spatial disaggregation is limited, often to high level regional information. On the other hand while Census data is typically comprehensive in terms of spatial scope, the quality of in particular income data, where it is available, is often not of sufficient quality or disaggregation for policy analysis. Many models therefore typically require the linkage of datasets of different types using statistical techniques. The most common data requirement for spatial microsimulation models is the availability of small area census data, available in most countries internationally. UK model\u2019s (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ballas &amp; Clarke, 2001a</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Anderson <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>) uses the UK Census Small Area Statistics (SAS).

Synthetic reconstruction involves the generation of a new dataset with spatial attributes, while reweighting takes an existing dataset and applies alternative weights. The most straightforward of the resampling methods is statistical matching. Resampling methods are possible when one has spatial micro data and involves directly linking one dataset to another, such as a geo-referenced small area census to an income micro survey. <a href=\"#bib47\">Decoster <i>et al</i>. (2009)</a> reviews four alternative methods, parametric and non-parametric regressions, grade correspondence matching and minimum distance matching. All four methods involve identifying overlapping variables between the two datasets. The regression based methods estimate sets of equations relating the variables to be matched (i.e. non overlapping) to the overlapping variables on the imputation dataset and then simulate the values in the master spatial dataset. The grade correspondence method, sometimes within sub-group, ranks the matching variable or variables and transfers the micro-units on the basis of rank. Lastly the minimum distance method identifies units in the master dataset that look most similar to the imputation dataset and transfers them.

This allows any number of changes to the data in the model to be made until an optimal reweighting methodology is reached (<a href=\"#bib154\">Smith <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib155\">2009</a>).",

In order to reduce this error further and produce a better fit, a swapping algorithm was developed to swap suitable simulated units between small areas. A further issue was that the survey selection pool contained less than a thousand individuals and was being used to estimate area populations, which contain thousands of individuals. This produced weights which were very small, less than 1, as the initial reweighting process was repeated a number of times for convergence purposes. In order to alleviate this situation, <a href=\"#bib155\">Smith <i>et al</i>.

GREGWT is a constrained distance minimisation function which uses a generalised regression technique (<a href=\"#bib20\">Bell, 2000</a>) to get an initial weight and iterates the regression until an optimal set of household or individual weights for each small area is derived. GREGWT is also deterministic, in that it generates the same result each time it is run. Optimisation is achieved when the difference between the estimated count and the known census count for each of the constraint variables is minimised or a predefined number of iterations is made at which stage the iteration stops. The iterative calculations are carried out for each small area one at a time. Once the reweighting process is finished, each household in the survey dataset should have a weight for each census small area that had counts for the constraint variables used. The method is effective for most districts in Australia, but areas with low population pose some problems for the method.",

For example, aspatial microdata sets can be reweighted to estimate the micro population at a local spatial scale (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ballas &amp; Clarke, 2000</a>). The method differs from IPF primarily in that it reweights or samples from a micro dataset until a new micro-dataset is generated that reflects the characteristics of the small area. Simulated annealing was originally applied in thermodynamics in the 1950s, when <a href=\"#bib115\">Metropolis <i>et al</i>. (1953)</a> developed a procedure for simulating the progression of a solid material to thermal equilibrium. Since then, simulated annealing has been employed as an optimisation technique to solve various combinatorial optimisation problems (<a href=\"#bib169\">Van Laarhoven &amp; Aarts, 1987</a>). In a geographical context, this method has been applied to solve examine a number of policy areas, including the SMILE agri-environmental model (<a href=\"#bib81\">Hynes <i>et al</i>., 2009a</a>) and the SMILE health model (<a href=\"#bib123\">Morrissey <i>et al</i>., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib122\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib125\">2013</a>)",

It is a probabilistic reweighting methodology whereby survey data are reweighted according to key constraining totals, or \u2018quotas\u2019, for each local area. In its simplest form, it randomly orders the micro data and then samples until the quotas characterised by the constraint variables are filled. The unit of analysis consists of individuals grouped into households while the constraints can be either at the individual or household level. This reweighting process is apportioned into a number of iterations, whereby an ordered repeated sampling procedure followed by the controlled broadening of constraining criteria allows for the marginal totals of census tables to be met with improved accuracy and computational efficiency. Constraints are generated from small area census data. Using these constraints, all eligible candidate households are extracted from the survey data. Fundamental to the quota sampling method is the random sorting and that the intra-household variation will cumulate in a random sort to result in relatively consistent aggregate totals consistent with the constraints. As a result it does not need to consider all possible combinations as in previous applications of combinatorial optimisation. Rather the \u201cswapping\u201d that simulated annealing requires is not undertaken until the constraints are nearly reached.

However, although not impossible, it is difficult to utilise the method when the unit of analysis of the constraint and the micro data are different. Using Monte Carlo simulation to generate data, it only produces micro data for variables that are contained in the constraints. <a href=\"#bib79\">Huang and Williamson (2001)</a> in a comparison between Simulated Annealing and IPF found the former to have less simulation variability, to be more reliable, more flexible, less complex and time consuming to program. Deterministic reweighting also has the advantage of ease of use and computational efficiency. In addition it replicates the same results each time. While generating weights where the unit of analysis of the constraints and the micro data are the same is straightforward, multiple units of analysis require non-trivial methods such as generalised regression weight based methods to generate the weights. As outlined above, a point to note is that weights will be non-integer and may be less than 1, particularly where the small area population is smaller than the micro survey being used to sample. One therefore requires a stochastic truncation method to determine which micro-units are selected. <a href=\"#bib195\">Williamson (2009)</a> highlights that when there are large numbers of constraints that the GREGWT algorithm does not always converge; \u201cthis \u2018non-convergence\u2019 of the algorithm is triggered by matrix singularity, making the matrix inversion required for a numerical solution impossible.

However in a dynamic model, the joint estimation of work and life histories is a formidable requirement given the available data. Therefore, it is necessary to assume that the marginal distributions of different processes are independent (<a href=\"#bib132\">O\u2019Donoghue, 2001</a>). Static ageing has a number of theoretical objections. Firstly, static ageing cannot be used where there are no individuals in the sample in a particular state. If there are a small number of cases of a particular household category, a very high weight may have to be applied, resulting in unstable predictions. Changing demographic and economic trends over time may mean that increasing weight is placed on population types with very few cases in the sample (<a href=\"#bib95\">Klevmarken 1997</a>). Secondly, static ageing procedures are relatively well suited to short to medium term forecasts where changes in the structure of the population are small.

Another challenge when reweighting methods have been used to generate the base data in the first instance is that the weights may vary over time. For example, over time, a household can form or dissolve. As a result, it may no longer make sense to maintain the original weight. De-weighting the data, by replicating households in proportion to the weights can resolve this issue.

Part of the reason for this is that there are relatively few agreed standards in relation to the development of the models, slowing the development as basic infrastructure has to be developed first. This is similar to other branches of microsimulation (<a href=\"#bib132\">O\u2019Donoghue, 2001</a>).

The future therefore may not necessarily be one of bigger and more complicated models, but perhaps more focused on deeper more targeted models.",
