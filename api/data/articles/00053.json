Especially the \u2018marital quotient\u2019 system - that allows spouses with monetary income to transfer part of their tax base to a spouse without monetary income - is no longer a tax allowance that compensates childcare efforts. It rather has become a subsidy to ?der cohorts for their past childcare efforts. As an alternative, we model in this article a system that is geared towards the effective care trajectories of nowadays parents. We thereby follow earlier ideas of Hilde Bojer, Patricia Apps and Ray Rees to reflect care efforts in the tax base of individuals. Following Bojer, we propose a system that incorporates a socially grounded amount of childcare time in household income, and simulate this with the Belgian microsimulation model MISIM. The amount relates to the number and age of children and can either be procured through childcare services or self-provision. In the proposed system both market- and self-provided care result in a similar subsidy. We elaborate a monetary estimate of self-provided childcare on the basis of the detailed information of time use in the Flemish Family and Care Survey (2004-2005). For discussion we provide an overview of potential drawbacks and advantages and evaluate the redistributive impact of the simulated alternative.",

The \u2018marital quotient\u2019 means that for single-income couples a proportion of the professional income of the earning spouse can be transferred to the non-earning spouse (for more details see <a href=\"#s3-4\">section 3.4</a>). The part transferred to the other spouse is then taxed separately, in general at a lower rate. Thus, to foster neutrality of choice, the system allows a tax advantage to couples with one spouse without (or with a low amount of) professional earnings. It thereby supposes that these spouses are engaged in care work. Yet, with the growing employment rate of Belgian mothers, the system has to a large extent transformed into a subsidy to older cohorts for their past childcare efforts rather than a compensation for childcare efforts of the current generation of parents (<a href=\"#bib10\">Verbist, 2002</a>).",

Society depends on parents for the raising of the future citizens and develops a set of socially sanctioned expectations (\u2018norms and values\u2019) to guarantee the proper upbringing of its members. Therefore, by having children, parents are socially constrained in their time allocation and can no longer realize their full income in the sense of <a href=\"#bib2\">Becker (1991)</a>. In other words, while the budget constraint of non-parents is constrained only by physiological limits to human effort, parents face an additional constraint imposed by social expectations regarding the upbringing of children. Parents are free to choose the exact mix of own childcare time and childcare services, but both options curtail the potential private income, either by a time constraint or by expenses on these services. Note, however, that <a href=\"#bib4\">Bojer (2006)</a> does not suggest to value the loss in potential private income through the effective care efforts of parents, but following Sen, proposes to determine a socially grounded amount of childcare effort through a democratic procedure. This means that parents receive a kind of childcare time entitlements according to the ruling social norms. In practice, most parents will spend either more or less time on their children than this norm, but this is their personal decision and they will not be compensated for a possibly larger effort<a href=\"#fn3\"><sup>3</sup></a>",

The Belgian SILC-2004 has 5,275 households and 12,971 individuals. Apart from the standard socioeconomic data (income, household composition, etc), this dataset contains specific data on childcare which are particularly relevant for our analysis. In 2004 there was a detailed set of questions on type of childcare (both formal and informal), as well as on the time spent by each child in these types. Unfortunately, the SILC data do not provide information on parental out-ofpocket payments for childcare. These are derived from the Flemish Family and Care Survey (FFCS), which was conducted in 2004/2005. The FFCS was elaborated to provide data for micro-distribution analysis of families with children in Flanders and provides data on income sources, expenses, care needs and the use of care services of families with children. We base our analyses on a representative sample drawn from the population register. Within this sample 474 families are effective users of child care services and have provided full information on child care costs and the time use of their children. The information in FFCS applies only to Flanders. As there is no similar data available for the other parts of the country, we assume that the information for Flanders is representative for Belgium as a whole. Below, we will discuss the degree of realism of this data driven assumption for every element of information we use from the FFCS.",

MISIM (MicroSImulationModel) is a static tax- benefit model, which enables to evaluate policy alternatives in the field of social security and personal income taxation. The model covers personal income taxes, social security contributions and part of social benefits. For this simulation, we need the personal income tax modules. In a first step taxable income is calculated, which includes professional income (both from self-employment and for employees) and social benefits, and interfamily transfers like alimony payments. As the cadastral income is not included in the first years of EU-SILC, real estate can unfortunately not be included; for more recent years cadastral income will be part of the Belgian version of SILC, thus enlarging the scope for potential simulations. The following tax deductions are applied on taxable income: professional expenses (at the rates provided in the tax law) and childcare fees. Next, the tariff structure is applied, as well as the tax credits for family composition, for replacement incomes and for long-term savings (to the extent that EU-SILC provides information on this last topic). As documented in <a href=\"#bib10\">Verbist (2002</a> and <a href=\"#bib11\">2003</a>), the Belgian personal tax system is well covered by MISIM, and outcomes are in line with administrative tax information.",

This rule, indissolubly interconnected with the marital quotient system, has a very modest effect in a system where the marital quotient system is in place.

Based on the institutional characteristics we described above, we expect several distributional shifts. First, a horizontal shift will take place from families without children to families with children, because we replace a general tax reduction measure (marital quotient) with a measure directed specifically at families with children. Secondly, we also expect shifts within the group of families with children. In general, families with younger children will be favoured by the new measures because the bulk of socially grounded childcare time is situated among families with a child at preschool age (see <a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a>). Shifts between single earner and dual earner families with children can also be expected, yet their overall direction is an empirical matter since two opposing elements are at work. On the one hand, single earner families are likely to lose income in the new policy scenario because the marital quotient is abolished, but on the other hand all families with children receive the new childcare time benefit which may compensate single earner families with children for the loss of tax benefits from the marital quotient. Our micro-simulation results will shed empirical light on this a priori indeterminacy.",

Because of relatively fewer children in the extreme quintiles, the amount of the average parental subsidy is slightly smaller in these quintiles. The tax increase due to abolition of the marital quotient system is less evenly distributed: loss is largest in the second quintile, where the martial quotient is most frequent. Relative to disposable equivalent income in the baseline scenario, disposable income in the first quintile rises most strongly, because of the lower baseline equivalent income, followed by the fourth quintile, because of the highest concentration of children under 13 in this quintile. The second is the only quintile where the net change in disposable equivalent income is negative. This is due to the fact that families that make use of the marital quotient system are concentrated in quintile 2, and to a lesser extent in quintile 3, where the net change remains below average as well.",

A person is considered unaffected if his change in yearly disposable equivalent income from the baseline to the alternative scenario remains below \u20ac10. It is confirmed that gainers are situated mostly in the upper middle quintiles, while losing families are concentrated in the lower middle quintiles. Nevertheless, the 25% gaining households in the first quintile gain most of all quintiles, both in relative and in absolute numbers. The explanation is twofold. On the one hand, the families with children in the lower quintiles are slightly more numerous than on average (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). on the other hand, the amount a household gains from using the marital quotient tends to rise with income, resulting in a smaller loss in the first quintile (at least in absolute numbers; in relative terms the households at the lower end of the income distribution that lose income face the largest decline in disposable income, expressed as a % of the income in the baseline scenario). Accordingly, for families in the first quintile with children that make use of the marital quotient, the average gain is least affected by the losses due to tax increase, resulting in a higher gain in absolute numbers.",

Households without children that make use of the marital quotient system are unanimously losers. The unaffected exceptions in the lower quintiles are most probably households whose allowance due to the marital quotient is too low ? because of low income of both spouses ? to result in a significant change in yearly disposable income. The average absolute amount that the families in this category lose rises with their income. This is a logical consequence of the system\u2019s feature that the amount a household gains from using the marital quotient tends to rise with income. The progressivity of the Belgian tax system causes the marginal tax rate against which the income of the earning spouse would be taxed when it was not transferred to the other spouse to be higher for high income marital quotient users. In both relative and absolute terms, low income marital quotient users, as a consequence, benefit less from it than their high income counterparts, or lose less in the case of its abolition.",

Likewise, between-group inequality for the family types we defined rises sharply as well.

Not surprisingly, poverty among this group increases. The main winners are families with young children, often double earner couples that do not (or hardly) use the marital quotient. This intergenerational redistribution and increased poverty among the elderly call for concern (especially as the elderly are already identified as a vulnerable group).
