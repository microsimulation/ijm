A major reason for this has been the lack of appropriate input data. In Europe this has recently changed among others by the launch of the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). In this paper we explain how microsimulation analysis of wealth-related taxes and policies is enhanced by using the HFCS as input data for EUROMOD, the EU-wide tax-benefit microsimulation model. Pilot databases for Belgium and Italy were explored in Kuypers et al. (2016). This paper builds further on that work by extending the coverage to 17 countries and introducing the simulation of new wealth-related policies in EUROMOD. We explain the processes used to build the input data and to code the wealth-related policies in EUROMOD and highlight some important advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we put forward some research questions which may be addressed by using this enhanced model.",

Yet, the need for models and tools to study the wealth distribution and the effects of policy intervention have increased substantially over the last decades. Since wealth inequality has been rising in many OECD countries (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alvaredo et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">OECD, 2020</a>) higher wealth taxation has been put forward as a way to decrease inequality and potentially raise government revenues. So far this literature has been largely theoretical. To complement it a microsimulation model including information on the wealth distribution can provide empirical results on the redistributive effects of currently existing wealth taxes as well as ex-ante insights into the potential effects of higher taxation or any other potential reform.",

In Europe this has recently changed among others by the launch of the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) \u2013 a comparative survey on households\u2019 assets, liabilities, incomes and consumption carried out in the countries of the Euro Area as well as Hungary, Poland (from 2<sup>nd</sup> wave onwards) and Croatia (from 3<sup>rd</sup> wave onwards) and which is coordinated at the European Central Bank (ECB). In this paper we explain how microsimulation analysis of wealth-related taxes and policies is enhanced by using the HFCS as input data for EUROMOD, the EU-wide tax-benefit microsimulation model. Pilot databases for Belgium and Italy based on the first HFCS wave were explored in <a href=\"#bib14\">Kuypers et al. (2016)</a>. This paper builds further on that work by extending the coverage to 17 countries based on the second HFCS wave and by introducing the simulation of new wealth-related taxes and policies in EUROMOD. The countries include Belgium and Italy and 15 additional countries: Austria, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Spain. The Netherlands, Malta and Latvia are not included, mainly because of their small sample sizes. We focus on simulating recurrent real property taxation, real property transfer taxation, inheritance and gift taxation and net wealth taxation as they currently exist. Where possible we also improve the simulation of policies which rely on wealth information in some way. This includes for instance the taxation of income from real and financial assets, tax incentives for asset accumulation and asset-testing in determining eligibility for social transfers.",

Indeed, the current set of countries includes countries with a flat personal income tax (Hungary, Estonia), countries with low social security provisions (Greece, Estonia) and countries which do not tax intergenerational transfers (Austria, Estonia, Slovak Republic). Also the relationship between the distributions of income and net wealth is strong is some countries (e.g. Spain, France) and fairly weak in others (e.g. Poland) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kuypers et al., 2021</a>). This modelling tool will have the potential to analyse current wealth-related taxes and tax reforms and their impact on household income and wealth and inequalities therein in EU countries, covering: (1) analyses of existing wealth tax systems; (2) timely analyses of wealth tax policy reforms that might actually come into force in the years to come; (3) analyses of potential alternative wealth tax policy reforms; (4) analyses of the joint effect of wealth tax policy reforms and other tax-benefit reforms affecting households\u2019 disposable income and net wealth.",

As argued by <a href=\"#bib3\">Davies et al. (2011)</a> this matters because those households are less likely to participate in surveys and more likely to underreport, in particular when it comes to financial assets. Another interesting feature of the HFCS data is that it uses a multiple imputation technique to deal with selective item non-response. Since EUROMOD requires that there is no missing information, this has the major advantage that missing information does not need to be imputed by researchers themselves. For more information on the oversampling and multiple imputation procedure of the HFCS we refer to <a href=\"#bib8\">HFCN (Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Network) (2016)</a>.",

The first is to impute wealth information from the HFCS into the existing EU-SILC based EUROMOD dataset, while another option is to build a completely new input dataset fully based on HFCS. Since we want to maintain the strengths of the HFCS in terms of oversampling and multiple imputation and because the HFCS covers in general all other information needed in a EUROMOD input dataset we chose the latter option. Hence, this means that we create an input dataset based on HFCS covering all \u2018standard\u2019 variables needed for tax-benefit simulations also included in EU-SILC (with a few exceptions) complemented with additional wealth-related variables. In order to utilise the multiple imputation advantage to the fullest, we created five separate input databases, each representing information on one of the five imputations. Each dataset is run through EUROMOD, the results shown in this paper represent the average over the five output datasets. <a href=\"#bib23\">Figari et al., 2007</a> noted that a database must fulfil certain requirements in order to be used in a sensible way in EUROMOD. As discussed by <a href=\"#bib14\">Kuypers et al. (2016)</a>, the HFCS fulfils the majority of these criteria such that it can be used in a reasonable way as input data in EUROMOD.",

Moreover, given that the Netherlands has administrative wealth data which show a large discrepancy with the HFCS estimates (see <a href=\"#bib20\">Salverda, 2015</a>), it does not seem appropriate to include it. Nevertheless, even without these countries our selection represents a broad range of European countries with various kinds of tax-benefit systems in place. Besides the fact that they differ in the more \u2018traditional\u2019 tax-benefit instruments (i.e. personal income tax, social insurance contributions, social transfers), they also largely differ in the extent and progressivity of wealth-related taxation or the way in which wealth is taken into account in determining eligibility for social transfers (i.e. \u2018asset-testing\u2019). The broad coverage of countries takes advantage of the harmonised framework of EUROMOD and allows to study the budgetary and redistributive effects of wealth-related taxation and other policies from a cross-country perspective.",

This information is unfortunately not available in the HFCS. To solve this issue we approximate the cadastral values by calculating a ratio between the total of all cadastral values (i.e. at the national level) from external sources and the total market value of properties estimated based on the HFCS. The reported current value of each individual property in the HFCS is then multiplied by this ratio (also taking into account the % ownership of the individual/household). Although there is no reason to assume a link between taxable and market values, it is currently the only available approach and as the validation shows (see Section 4.2) the results are relatively good<sup><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup>. For some countries no relevant external information could be found so the ratio could not be calculated; in these cases we approximate the cadastral value in line with policy parameters of the real property tax, e.g. for Luxembourg cadastral values are assumed to be 0.5% of market values (see <a href=\"#bib2\">Boone et al., 2019</a> for details). <a href=\"#table3\">Table 3</a> provides an overview of the applied ratios for the countries where cadastral values are the tax base for the real property tax.",

Thus, for all countries we approximate the purchase year of property other than the main residence by the year in which a household took out a mortgage using other property as collateral (not in case of refinancing a previous mortgage). We assume that a property was not purchased recently if there is no outstanding mortgage or loan. Hence, the real property transfer tax does not apply in these cases.

In most countries tax rates depend on the relationship between the donor/deceased and the beneficiary. For this purpose information on from whom a gift/inheritance is received is taken from the HFCS. In case this information is missing we assume the inheritance/gift to be received from parents as it is the most common relationship. Finally, many countries grant tax exemptions, deductions or preferential tax rates for certain types of assets such as the family home or business assets. In the HFCS we observe the total amount that each inheritance/gift is worth as well as which types of assets are received, but not the amount for each asset type separately.

Some countries levy lower tax rates on certain types of financial income (i.e. Belgium, Italy\u2026), while others have a special tax in place on specific financial income (i.e. Cyprus and Luxembourg). In the HFCS only an aggregate amount of financial income is observed (i.e. the sum of interests, dividends, rents, etc.). In contrast, we do observe separate amounts for the stock variables (e.g. value of savings accounts, value of public shares, etc.) from which the different types of financial income are generated. One way to impute the separate amounts of income streams would be to take the share of each stock variable in the total financial asset portfolio and apply these shares to the financial income variable. This approach, however, neglects the fact that publicly traded shares typically generate a larger return than for instance money in savings accounts. Therefore, we apply a slightly different approach consisting of two steps. We first multiply each stock variable containing the value of a financial asset with a national average rate of return taken from administrative data (in case a household does not own the respective financial asset the corresponding income variable is of course equal to zero). We then correct each amount imputed in the first step by the same percentage such that the sum of all imputed variables is equal to the total financial income variable observed in HFCS. We use the same average rate of return for all households. Although evidence suggests that wealthier investors tend to gain higher rates of return than smaller investors (e.g. <a href=\"#bib24\">Piketty, 2014</a>), this kind of information is not available in administrative data.",

For the event wealth taxes (i.e. real property transfer tax, inheritance and gift tax) this is not a problem as the variables covering these events refer to the moment the event takes place and we only simulate the tax for those experiencing the event in the policy year. Recurrent real estate taxes are usually levied on size in square meters or cadastral values which generally do not change from one year to the next. However, in the HFCS the recurrent wealth variables refer to the situation at the time of the interview (for Italy, Hungary and Finland to the last day of the income reference period), while yearly net wealth taxes are usually levied on the first day of the year. Therefore, we need to impute the value of net wealth owned on January 1<sup>st</sup> of the income reference year based on the value of net wealth observed in HFCS, which is generally one to two years later. We approximate the first value by taking the latter and subtracting the following amounts a) the value of real estate purchased and inheritances/gifts received in both the income reference year and the survey year as these represent wealth not yet owned by households at the time the wealth tax was levied<sup><a href=\"#fn4\">4</a></sup> and b) financial income received in the income reference year as an estimate of the growth of financial assets between the time the wealth tax was levied and the moment wealth was observed.",

In EU-SILC, in contrast, benefits are covered separately, with some surveyed at the household level and others at the individual level. A detailed disaggregation is also beneficial for the accuracy of the simulations in EUROMOD. In principle the HFCS social benefits variable may contain all kinds of social benefits, such as housing benefits, child benefits, parental leave allowances, educational allowances, social assistance, etc. To address this issue we decided to include in the input database a variable containing the amount of the total social benefits as observed in HFCS. In EUROMOD we then simulate those social benefits which can be accurately simulated based on other observed information. These are mostly child benefits and social assistance \u2013 which are often the most important benefits \u2013 but sometimes also other benefits are simulated. When analysing the output we then use the simulated benefits and the residual benefits from the aggregate variable \u2013 if any \u2013 to calculate disposable income. In other words, in case the simulated benefits are larger than the observed benefits in HFCS we use the simulated amounts, if they are smaller it points towards the receipt of other non-simulated benefits and then we use the observed amount of benefits. See <a href=\"#bib2\">Boone et al. (2019)</a> for a list of social benefits which are part of EUROMOD, but which cannot be simulated based on the HFCS data. As these often entail only small benefits received by a limited number of people, the effects on the simulation results are likely to be small.",

At the moment the most recent coding of the wealth-related taxes and policies in EUROMOD applies to the situation in 2017. To be able to run the input data from the second HFCS wave on the 2017 policies we need to uprate monetary variables to the price levels of 2017. Income components and other variables are uprated using the standard uprating indices included in EUROMOD (for more information on the general uprating procedure see the EUROMOD Country Reports).

Detailed information on the uprating procedure for each country can be found in <a href=\"#bib2\">Boone et al. (2019)</a>. First, the main asset variables are uprated based on their respective aggregates in the national accounts<sup><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup>. In the case of Germany these were taken from the <a href=\"#bib5\">Federal Statistical Office Germany (2018a)</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Federal Statistical Office Germany (2018b)</a> and the <a href=\"#bib4\">Deutsche Bundesbank (2018)</a>. Although categories of the national accounts and HFCS do not always coincide perfectly (<a href=\"#bib9\">Kavonius and Honkkila, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Waltl, 2020)</a>, they are the best available information to take into account the evolution of assets and debt. We try to match the categories as close as possible. For self-employment business assets we used the categories \u2018machinery &amp; equipment\u2019 and \u2018intellectual property rights\u2019 from the national accounts as proxy. For the HFCS asset categories \u2018managed accounts\u2019 and \u2018money owed to households\u2019 there is no information available in the national accounts. For managed accounts we apply the same uprating index as for mutual funds and for money owed to the household we use the EUROMOD default, i.e. the price index. The aggregate wealth variables \u2018total financial assets\u2019, \u2018total real assets\u2019 and \u2018total assets\u2019 are uprated by setting them equal to the sum of their uprated components. The uprate index for the value of real property is also applied to the value of real property at the time of purchase, which is used in the simulation of the real property transfer tax. Cadastral values are not uprated. Furthermore, the monetary variables used in the simulation of the inheritance and gift tax are uprated using administrative information on the total amount of inheritances and gifts larger than 0 euro (<a href=\"#bib7\">Federal Statistical Office Germany, 2018c</a>). This information is not available for most countries, so then the uprate index is defined in terms of the evolution in government revenues from inheritance and gift taxation. Since the applicable tax legislation has not significantly changed in the period we are uprating over, it is relatively certain that changes in the tax revenues mainly reflect changes in the amount of wealth that is received or inherited.",

In general, there are no exemptions from this tax, although transfers of properties between lineal heirs or properties held by the government are exempt from taxation in some countries (e.g. Germany, Portugal, Spain \u2026). For Finland and Slovakia, we are not able to simulate the transfer tax. For Finland this is because in HFCS information on wealth transfers is missing as it is based on a combination of register data and a supplementary module added to the EU-SILC survey (<a href=\"#bib8\">HFCN (Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Network), 2016</a>). In Slovakia the real estate transfer tax was abolished in 2005, but there is still a very small registration fee in place.

Next, we turn to the validation of the newly-added wealth policies in EUROMOD and present an overview of the number of potentially liable observations and the number of observed taxpayers for each tax category. Finally, for macro-validation purposes we compare the simulated tax revenues with figures from external sources to assess the accuracy of the simulations.",

To be able to compare accurately between EM-HFCS and EM-SILC the newly simulated wealth-related taxes are here not subtracted from disposable income.

Comparability between the results of EM-HFCS and EM-SILC varies widely across countries. Results are close to each other for Finland, Portugal and Slovakia, while they diverge rather strongly for Austria, Estonia, France and Slovenia. Differences are usually larger for original & pension income than for disposable income and larger for the mean than for the median. The differences mostly reflect higher amounts in EM-HFCS than in EM-SILC, which might be related to the oversampling that is applied in the HFCS (see above).

In general, the number of potentially liable observations and the number of observed taxpayers is highest for the real property tax. In comparison, the number of observations for the inheritance & gift tax, real property transfer tax and mortgage registration duties are considerably lower. In general, the number of observed taxpayers is the same in 2017 compared to the income reference period as most tax legislation did not change (drastically) over this period. The most important differences are (1) that for Greece the number of payers of the real property tax increased between the income reference year and 2017 because of a reform from an \u2018emergency property tax\u2019 to the property tax as it exists today, (2) that for Italy the number of payers of the real property tax decreased because the main residence has become exempted from taxation since 2016 and (3) that the number of tax payers of the Spanish net wealth tax is zero in the income reference year (2010) since this tax was abolished between 2008 and 2011.",

We show here both the validation for the income reference period as for 2017 because the first shows best how well our simulations perform, while the latter provides some insight in the appropriateness of the uprating. Since the number of observations is highest for the real property tax this tax is on average the most accurately simulated wealth tax. For the other taxes the simulated revenues diverge more from the external figures. There are several reasons for this. First, as <a href=\"#table8\">Table 8</a> showed the number of observations in the underlying data are often very low such that the results largely depend on a few cases. When these cases happen to be outliers this has a massive effect on the results. Second, as the results largely depend on the input database, underreporting in the HFCS data may have an effect on the simulation results. Moreover, our simulations are not always completely comparable to the external statistics as the latter are not always available at a detailed level. For instance, we simulate wealth taxes for households, but external figures often do not make a distinction between taxes paid by households versus other economic actors.",

First, EUROMOD can be used to transform the original gross HFCS incomes into disposable incomes, making the HFCS also a suitable dataset for standard (re)distributive analyses. Second, the increased scope of EUROMOD with wealth-related policies allows for new research questions to be addressed. In what follows, we briefly discuss some interesting examples.",

Also, apart from pensions and unemployment benefits, all other social transfers are covered under a single variable. Including the HFCS as an underlying database for EUROMOD allows to simulate these components of the tax-benefit systems for the households covered in the HFCS and to derive disposable incomes. In this way the HFCS becomes an additional source which can be used for research on poverty, inequality and redistribution in Europe, which is currently largely based on EU-SILC and the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS). Moreover, compared to these sources the HFCS has the major advantage that it covers information on both income and wealth such that poverty, inequality and redistribution can be studied both in terms of the distribution of income as well as the distribution of wealth, or a combination of the two.",

In this literature it is argued that financial well-being and precariousness depend on both income and wealth and hence that wealth should be taken into account when determining who is worse off (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kuypers and Marx, 2019</a>). Given that the two distributions are not perfectly correlated poverty measures based on income alone tend to overstate poverty rates among households with low income, but median to high net wealth, while they potentially ignore the precarious situation of households with incomes above the poverty threshold, but with very low assets or bearing a large debt burden (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kuypers and Marx, 2021</a>). Therefore, two approaches have been proposed to define joint income-wealth poverty indicators. Up until a few years ago this literature was largely US-oriented. The combination of disposable incomes and net wealth in the HFCS now also allows to estimate such indicators for Europe (see for instance <a href=\"#bib13\">Kuypers and Marx, 2021</a> forthcoming; <a href=\"#bib11\">Kuypers and Marx (2018)</a>).",

The absolute redistributive effect is given by the difference between the Gini coefficient of the income distribution before and after income taxes and social insurance contributions are taken into account. The relative redistributive effect than expresses this absolute redistributive effect as a percentage of the Gini coefficient before income taxes and social insurance contributions are taken into account. A positive redistributive effect means inequality is reduced through taxes and SIC, while a negative sign indicates an increase in inequality. We find that income taxes and social insurance contributions reduce inequality by between 1.5% in Poland and 21.6% in Austria. The last two columns in <a href=\"#table10\">Table 10</a> show the two building blocks of the redistributive effect of taxes and SIC, namely their size (average tax rate) and their progressivity (Kakwani index). The average tax rates vary between 10% in Spain and 35% in Belgium. The Kakwani index shows that the total of income taxes and social insurance contributions is progressive, most strongly so in Ireland and less so in Poland and Hungary.",

First, due to broader policy scope we cannot only study the redistributive effect of the \u2018traditional\u2019 tax-benefit instruments, but also see how redistributive wealth taxation currently is. It is possible to evaluate the redistributive effects of wealth taxation against the income distribution (see <a href=\"#table10\">Table 10</a>), against the wealth distribution or from a joint income-wealth perspective (for the latter two see <a href=\"#bib16\">Kuypers et al., 2020</a>). Irrespective of the framework chosen, we find that in their current form wealth-related taxes are hardly redistributive. While <a href=\"#table10\">Table 10</a> shows that wealth taxes are often regressive when assessed against the distribution of income (i.e. the Kakwani index is negative), they are more progressive when assessed against the (joint) distribution of wealth (and income). However, even when the latter perspectives are taken wealth-related taxes do not achieve any significant redistribution as a consequence of their very small size (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kuypers et al., 2020</a>). The analysis of the wealth taxes can be combined with the standard redistributive analyses as described above. The whole tax-benefit system can then be evaluated against the joint distribution of income and wealth as is done in <a href=\"#bib15\">Kuypers et al. (2019)</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kuypers et al. (2021)</a>. This exercise shows that European welfare states are not as redistributive as they are generally believed to be as most efforts go towards reducing income inequalities, while wealth inequalities remain largely unaddressed. Besides studying current wealth tax systems, it is also possible to simulate the budgetary and (re)distributive effects of recent wealth tax proposals, or explore the prospects of radical new ideas (for instance taxing a wealth annuity in the personal income tax, see <a href=\"#bib16\">Kuypers et al., 2020</a>). Also, it allows to study these reforms in accordance with other tax-benefit instruments.",

Many European countries have such asset tests in place. Analysing the asset test in minimum income protection schemes in EU member states <a href=\"#bib18\">Marchal et al. (2021)</a> distinguish between two main types of asset tests. The first and most prevalent type applies a disqualification threshold, i.e. when assets are above a certain threshold applicants become immediately ineligible. The second type takes assets into account in a given percentage or at a fictional rate of return which is added to the income in the means-test, such that applicants are eligible to lower minimum income benefits as more assets are available (and eventually at high asset levels also become fully ineligible). Yet, this rate of return is usually higher than actual returns received so in practice assets often also need to be realised. The combination of HFCS with EUROMOD allows to simulate benefit eligibility with and without taking into account the asset test. Hence, it shows the effect of asset testing on eligibility rates, poverty rates and budgets and whether these are different for the two types of asset tests (<a href=\"#bib18\">Marchal et al., 2021</a>).",

Many countries across Europe have put in place tax expenditures for instance for mortgage interests, private pension savings and financial income. Using the HFCS data and EUROMOD we can analyse who benefits from these tax expenditures and its cost in terms of forgone tax revenues. Results indicate that these tax expenditures are regressive instruments. Poor households hardly benefit because they do not have the means to invest in the types of assets that are encouraged, because they do not pay sufficient taxes to be able to benefit from a deduction/credit and/or because they are discouraged to save because of asset testing. The EUROMOD-HFCS tool then also allows to simulate new proposed policies, for instance, subsidising wealth accumulation among the poor (see <a href=\"#bib10\">Kuypers, 2018</a>).",

This paper builds further on the work of <a href=\"#bib14\">Kuypers et al. (2016)</a> by extending the coverage to 17 countries and introducing the simulation of new wealth-related policies. We explain the processes used to build the input data and to code the wealth-related policies in EUROMOD. Using the HFCS as the underlying database for EUROMOD is interesting as it contains much more detailed information on assets and liabilities than EU-SILC. However, some data issues needed to be addressed in building the input data, such as the approximation of the cadastral values for the real property taxation, the disaggregation of certain variables based on imputation and the adaptations to net wealth from the value at the moment of observation to the value at the moment of taxation. In general, the majority of the wealth-related taxes can be simulated based on the HFCS, while this was often not possible based on EU-SILC. New uprating indices have been constructed based on national account information to be able to use the input data for simulations of more recent policy years. Although HFCS is more equipped to simulate wealth-related taxes and policies, possibly together with income-based taxes and transfers, EU-SILC is still considered to be most suitable dataset for research questions specifically focused at social transfers or at the situation of specific vulnerable groups. Given the strengths and weaknesses of each dataset and the sometimes relatively large differences between them (<a href=\"#table7\">Table 7</a>), the two datasets must be regarded as complements, rather than substitutes.",

Micro-level comparisons between EM-HFCS and EM-SILC show that comparability varies widely across countries. Results are close to each other for Finland, Portugal and Slovakia, while they diverge strongly for Austria, Estonia, France and Slovenia. The differences mostly reflect higher amounts and larger inequalities in EM-HFCS than in EM-SILC, which might be related to the HFCS oversampling. The macro-level validation of tax revenues indicated that the recurrent real property tax can be relatively accurately simulated, while other taxes are often more difficult to simulate properly because of few number of cases in the underlying input data. Differences in the macro-validation can, however, also be partly attributed to the fact that external statistics do not always exist at the same level as we simulate them.",

Second, the increased scope of EUROMOD with wealth-related policies allows for new research questions to be addressed, such as a better understanding of the joint distribution of income and wealth and the redistributive impact of wealth taxation.",

One would be to broaden the definition of wealth. At the moment HFCS and thus our simulations take into account the distribution of private wealth, that is the wealth owned by private households and which can be used and traded on markets as they wish. A more comprehensive view would, however, also take into account entitlements to public pensions and other social security benefits, known as \u2018augmented wealth\u2019. Including this information would make it more straightforward to compare countries with differing pension and welfare systems. A second potentially interesting future extension would be to consider behavioural responses to wealth-related taxation and policies. In previous research EUROMOD has been linked to labour supply models to study the effect of policy changes on individuals\u2019 labour supply. A similar effort could be considered for effects on decisions in relation to investment and asset portfolio allocation.",
