In addition, there is a pillar I national pension system and a guarantee pension system that supplement earnings-related pensions for those who have accrued no or only a relatively small earnings-related pension. It has been suggested that the limited role of private pensions (III pillar) is due to the fact that there is no ceiling in the earnings-related pension scheme (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andersen <i>et al</i>. 2014</a>, p. 124).",

The Finnish pension system is facing its next major reform in 2017.

For example, the new disability pensions will improve, the part time pension will be discontinued, new partial old-age pension<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> and years-of-service pensions will be introduced.

This is mainly due to the fact that the disability pensions starting before the reform are in general lower than the ones starting after the reform. For the cohorts born in the 1950\u2019s, the disability pensions have typically started already before the reform, but the pensions for these cohorts with extended working lives will improve.

The pressure to increase municipality tax rates is at least 3 percentage points in 50 per cent of the municipalities (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ministry of Finance 2015b</a>, p. 58). However, the Programme of Prime Minister Sipil\u00e4\u2019s Government (page 8) states that the total tax rate will not increase during the current term 2015\u20132019. Some changes in the structure of the taxation are to be expected, however. The Government Program indicates some cuts to the indexing of the pensions. On the other hand, the level of the guarantee pension is subject to increase slightly. We have not taken the changes stated in the Government Program into account in the simulation results presented in this article.",

The national pension is smaller for those living with a spouse or partner than for those who are living alone. In the ELSI model, the marital status is stochastic so that, on average, the share of people living alone stays at the same level for each gender and age group as in the years 2008\u20132013. The length of time lived abroad also affects the level of the national pension. The minimum requirement is that the individual has resided in Finland for at least three years after the age of 16. The national pension is paid abroad if Finland has a social security agreement with the country in question. In addition, simulation assumptions on insurance periods in Finland and social security agreement countries greatly affected the results. In 2014, the full monthly national pension for a person living alone in Finland was approximately EUR 630 (the average monthly total pension was ca EUR 1,590 and the average monthly wage EUR 3,300).",
