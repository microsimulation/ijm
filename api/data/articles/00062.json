The model also simulates control of the disease in terms of glycaemic levels, cholesterol levels, weight and blood pressure control. The model produces a wide range of epidemiological and economic outputs to assess the current and projected impact of those with the disease. The number and cost of complications associated with type 2 diabetes, conditioning on the level of diabetes control, are also projected.",

While the benefits of such programs often will not manifest until many years after implementation, the Diabetes Model simulation period enables long term benefits to be assessed beyond traditional government planning horizons. By comparing the results of the base case status quo projection to alternative simulations premised on interventions that either reduce the prevalence of diabetes risk factors or improve diabetes control among those known to have the disease, it is possible to identify the extent to which short run investments can reap long term benefits in both human and economic terms.",

As such, extending the model to those with pre-diabetes is a natural expansion of the scope of the model given the overall objective of minimising the future impact of diabetes, and in particular, providing a focus on the trade-off between direct health care costs incurred by those with the disease and the cost of providing population health programs aimed at minimising the impact of the disease.",

It is also the case that clinical guidelines have developed over time as experience with treating the disease has evolved. However, it should be noted that the DMM is run independently of the rest of the model with no feedbacks to alter the population based prevalence of diabetes related risk factors. The absence of feedbacks is because there is currently no cure for type 2 diabetes. Therefore, even if the DMM is used to project improved control of risk factors for type 2 diabetes (ie an ostensible reduction in the prevalence of risk factors for type 2 diabetes), this cannot be permitted to impact on the number of people projected to have the disease.",

To implement the intervention, records from among the eligible population are randomly selected until 10,000 people have been selected (based on the sum of the record weights).

These are then applied in a manner that ensures that the univariate improvements across the four areas are properly reflected in the joint distribution of diabetes control following participation in the intervention.
