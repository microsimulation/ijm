A micro simulation model can be seen as a set of rules, which operates on a sample of micro units such as individuals, households and firms. Each micro unit is defined and characterized by a set of properties (variables) and as the model is simulated these properties are updated for each and every micro unit. The model might simply be a set of deterministic rules such as the income tax rules of a country operating on a sample of tax payers, and used to compute the distribution of after tax income, the aggregate income tax revenue or other fiscal entities of interest. But the model could also include behavioral assumptions usually formulated as stochastic models. Examples are fertility models, models for household formation and dissolution, labor supply and mobility.",

Although unpractical, we can in principle model every individual in the population.

It stimulates the researcher to pay attention to the institutional circumstances that constrain the behavior of consumers and firms. It also in a straightforward way suggests what data should be collected and from whom. Similarly, in a micro simulation model it is possible to include the true policy parameters and the rules which govern their use, such as tax rates, eligibility rules, tax thresholds, etc. One is not confined to using average tax rates applied to everyone.

                    "text": "The development of micro simulation can be traced to two different sources. One is Guy Orcutt\u2019s idea about mimicking natural experiments also in economics and his development of the behavioral dynamic micro simulation model DYNASIM (<a href=\"#bib35\">Orcutt, 1957</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Orcutt et al., 1961</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">1976</a>) that later was further developed by Steven Caldwell into the CORSIM model (<a href=\"#bib4\">Caldwell, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">1996</a>). Another source is the increased interest among policy makers for distributional studies. Changes in the tax and benefit systems of many Western economies has developed a need for a tool that analyzes who will win and who will loose from changes in the tax and benefit systems. As a result many governments now have so called tax-benefit models. Examples are the Danish LAW model, the UK model POLIMOD (<a href=\"#bib40\">Redmond et al., 1996</a>), STINMOD in Australia (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lambert et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Schofield and Polette, 1996</a>), SWITCH in Ireland (<a href=\"#bib6\">Callan et al., 1996</a>), and FASIT<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> in Sweden. At the European level EUROMOD is an ambitious attempt to build a tax-benefit model for all of EU (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sutherland, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sutherland, 2001</a>). These models usually do not include behavioral relations but only most details of the tax and benefit rules. These rules are then applied to a sample of individuals for which one knows all gross incomes and everything else needed to compute taxes and benefits. For every individual in the sample one is thus able to compute the sum of all (income) taxes due and the disposable income for each household. The output becomes, for instance, the distribution of disposable income. It is then possible to change the tax rates or anything else in the tax code and run the model once again and compare to the previous result. In this way one can analyze who will gain and who will loose from a tax change, and estimate the aggregate budget effects of tax and benefit changes. The simulation model will, however, only give the first-order effect of a tax change, because household composition, work hours and incomes are assumed unchanged and not influenced by the taxes. This is both strength and weakness of the tax-benefit models. It is strength because it is easy to understand what the model does and no controversial assumptions are needed. There is also no difficult inference problem. All the analyst needs to do is to draw an inference from the random sample of taxpayers to the population of taxpayers, which is something we know from sampling theory.<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> The weakness is of course that we do not know the relative size of any adjustments of behavior to the tax and benefit changes. Many tax reforms aim at changing the behavior of taxpayers. The first-order effect might then become a bad approximation. As a result attempts have been made to enlarge the tax-benefit models with behavioral models to capture these adjustments. <a href=\"#bib10\">Duncan and Weeks (1997)</a> gives an example of a tax-benefit model amended with a labor supply model. Additional examples can be found in Table 3 in <a href=\"#bib27\">Klevmarken (1997)</a>. In this way the tax-benefit models approach Orcutt\u2019s DYNASIM and its successors.",

Examples are the Swedish MICROHUS (<a href=\"#bib30\">Klevmarken and Olovsson, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Klevmarken, 2001</a>, Appendix), the Dutch NEDYMAS (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nelissen, 1994</a>) and the German Sfb3-MSM (<a href=\"#bib25\">Helberger, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hain and Helberger, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Galler and Wagner, 1986</a> and <a href=\"#bib17\">Galler, 1989</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">1994</a>).

Sometimes we have policy problems which require that these discontinuities are modeled at an individual level where an aggregate approach is impossible. For instance, in the Swedish ATP pension system pensions were based on the 15 best years of earnings and studies of the properties of this pension system required simulations of individual earnings profiles to determine the 15 best years. Another example is a study of the cost for old age care in the United Kingdom (see <a href=\"#bib21\">Hancock (2000)</a>).

The models needed in these situations are models that simulate the whole distribution of outcomes well. It is not sufficient to simulate means or conditional means but we also have to replicate the tails of the distributions. This focus has obvious implications for model building: heterogeneity in behavior must be reflected in the model structure and the properties of residual variation must be carefully considered. But it also has implications for estimation and validation. Criterions for estimation and validation should agree with the general purpose of micro simulation and not just aim at estimating conditional means (see below).",

Assume also that we know y<sub>0i</sub> (and possibly also a longer history) for every individual. We will then need a model structure that uses the information y<sub>0i</sub> to simulate the future of each individual. Economic models are not always derived on this form. It is often the case that these models have been adapted to cross-sectional applications and implicitly assume that a new decision is taken at every new time point without being influenced by past decisions. Such models are not very useful in dynamic micro simulation. They tend to introduce too much mobility and too quickly decaying autocorrelations. Consider for instance a labor supply model. In a dynamic micro simulation context labor supply should not only be a function of the wage rate, non-labor income and the income tax system, but also of the current and possibly past labor supply, episodes of non-work etc. Most people who have a job do not change their hours very much from one year to another.",

With the micro simulation focus on policy evaluation this is an important issue. If the model structure is not autonomous to policy changes (within ranges of interest) it is not possible to use the model for this purpose. It is however, not easy to know if a model is sufficiently stable to permit the analysis of a certain change in policy.",

Frequently we need to model the presence of a property or an event and if the individual has the property or experiences this event we have to simulate an intensity or an amount. For instance, we might like to simulate if an individual has a job or not and if he/she is working we also need the number of work hours. A common model is a two-equation selection model with a probit equation for the participation decision and a regression model capturing the number of hours. If there is correlation between the two equations, they are usually estimated jointly or by the Heckit approach to capture the endogenous selection into the group of working individuals. The estimated hours equation then applies unconditionally to the entire population. In a simulation context the two equations have to be simulated jointly. An alternative approach is to estimate the distribution of hours worked conditional on having a job. The model for the probability to get a job and the hours model can then be simulated sequentially. This second approach can be criticized because the properties of the conditional hours equation might depend on who is selected into having a job. Any policy change that influences employment may then also change the hours equation. On the other hand, only those who get or have a job have a choice of hours, while those who do not have a job might not even think about how many hours they would work had they had a job. An equally plausible model is thus to assume that it is the fact that an individual has a job that determines the decision about hours. This does not exclude that individuals choose different hours and that the composition of the group of employed will determine the total number of hours and even the dependence of hours on wage rates and nonlabor incomes. To get a model that is robust to policy changes the factors that determine heterogeneity in the responses to wage rates and income changes would then have to be included in the hours equation.",

In particular there are good reasons to think that preferences change as people age.

In dynamic micro simulation one would ideally have a longitudinal data set that can serve all three purposes. This is rarely the case. In practice the data set that gives the start values is usually a cross-sectional sample or at best a short panel that can also be used to estimate some of the relations needed in the micro simulation model. For this project we have been able to use the rich longitudinal register data of the LINDA data base from Statistics Sweden. Start data were taken from the 1999 wave, but amended with information from other sources.<sup><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup> Quite frequently behavioural relations have to be estimated using other data sources than the start data set because the variables needed are not included (with the accompanying problems of differences in the definitions of units of analysis and the variables being used). The set of variables included in the data set that gives start values thus sets limits as to which variables one can use to explain behaviour. Not only the target variables of the micro simulation analysis need be simulated but also all explanatory variables and they also have to be assigned start values. To some extent this problem can be circumvented. An example from our work on the simulation model SESIM can explain this. LINDA does not include any health data, but health status is an important variable both in its own right and to explain various processes related to aging such as retirement and the demand for health care and social care. There was thus a need to introduce a model that imputed health status for the base year and then simulated any changes in health status as people aged. This model was estimated from an external data source but recognizing that the variables driving the health status model, such as age, gender, marital status, schooling, area of residence and if born in Sweden, had to be included in the data set of start values.",

Suppose theory suggests that the distribution of a variable y depends on another variable x, while it is difficult to formulate and estimate a good model for x because there is no good theory to explain x or because we do not have access to all the data needed to estimate such a model. Depending on the context it might then be better to simulate y unconditionally of x, or use a proxy for x if possible, than to use a poor model to simulate x. In evaluating these alternatives one again has to consider the possibility that a change in policy might change the unconditional distribution of y while the conditional distribution might be more stable (c f above).",

In building the SESIM model we encountered a problem in estimating the health status model mentioned above. The data we could use had a longer time span than a year. In this particular case we had to use data with a lag of eight years. Assuming that the true model has a lag of one year and that the parameters were known, then it would be possible to simulate health status paths for eight years and compare to observed data.

For instance, to simulate the tax base for the tax on income from capital we needed a function that simulated interest paid on mortgages and loans. One might think that nobody would pay interest unless one has a loan and that it would be natural to model interest paid not in kronor but as a rate on the sum of all mortgages and loans. In this way we could also avoid the problem of indexing an amount by the CPI or another index. However, it turned out that some of these rates came out with missing values and some rates were unrealistically high. Our annual data included mortgages and loans at the end of a year and the sum of all interest paid during a year. Closer inspection showed that 25% of the sample households had paid interest in a year without having any loan or mortgage at the end of the year and 10% had paid interest without having any loans or mortgages either in the beginning of the year or at the end. The probability of misreported data is very low, because they were register data originating from banks, insurance companies and brokers and not self-reported data. A reasonable explanation is that some people take up a loan and repay it in the same calendar year and thus they had no loan in the beginning nor at the end of the year, but they had to pay interest. The unrealistically high estimated rates had a similar explanation. People had taken a loan or increased their mortgage in a year but repaid most of it before the end of the year. In these cases the liability both in the beginning of the year and at the end was small relative to the interest paid. Our solution in this particular case was to stick to the idea of an interest rate function but censor the data before the model was estimated and only use observations with liabilities of at least 1000 SEK (111 euro) at the end of the year. The convenience of this solution has the price that our simulations will underestimate the interest paid a little because households with no liabilities will in the simulations never pay interest, but the amounts paid by these households are after all rather small.",

Macro entities such as the CPI, interest rates, the increase in the average wage rate, and the unemployment rate are usually fed into the micro simulation model exogenously. This is a simple solution in already rather complex models, but there are at least two problems: First, the macro assumptions must be made internally consistent and consistent with the path of the household sector simulated by the model. Second, it is usually very difficult to have an opinion about the values of these macro indicators in the future. Most analysts thus assume constant rates possibly after a few years of variation close to the base year. This convention has the disadvantage of not exposing the micro simulation model to normal business cycle variations. A more realistic approach, which still makes the macro indicators exogenous to the micro simulation model, is to generate swings in the macro indicators mimicking business cycles by, for instance, a VAR model.",

One can, however, think of situations in which a market feed back is of key importance for the micro simulation analysis. Returning to our experiences of the model SESIM, when we introduced geographical mobility into the model, we also had to consider its potential impact on house prices. Housing wealth is a major share of the wealth of Swedish households and the market values of houses and apartments show considerable variation across the country. While there is not much of a trend in the real house price index for the whole country, only cyclical swings, the prices in the major metropolitan areas have increased dramatically in the last decades. If the model would simulate continued migration to these areas house prices would most certainly increase even more and at the same time shift wealth from households living in urban areas to households in the major cities, but probably also cool off the migration process unless the building of new homes in these areas could accommodate the new migration. In this case it would thus be in line with one purpose of SESIM \u2013 to simulate the future distribution of wealth for the elderly \u2013 to include the market, at least in the form of a price mechanism.<sup><a href=\"#fn6\">6</a></sup> Until this is accomplished, we have to forward house prices exogenously.",

It can also be a result of the dynamic model structure, in particular if it is such that the simulated path is sensitive to the start values. Another possible explanation is lack of coherence between the data used to estimate the model and the start data set.

Sometimes a variable transformation is helpful, but it is not always easy to find one. Data might also be censored from below or from above. Variables capturing assets and other wealth items sometimes show extreme outliers. OLS-based estimation is not such a good idea in these situations because the extreme tails will tend to dominate the estimates to the extent that the model might not simulate well even in the centre of the distribution. In our work with SESIM we have sometimes preferred to work with robust estimation methods (robust regression) that weight down the extreme tails and thus limit their influence. As a consequence, residuals to the estimated relation must be simulated from the empirical distribution of the residuals from the robust regression. We have chosen to estimate the percentiles of this distribution and interpolate linearly between them. In the last percentile one might have to deviate from a linear interpolation between the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile and the maximum value in order to avoid excessively many very large draws.",

Although the supply of micro data has increased a great deal in the last 20-30 years it is still hardly possible to find one data source or one sample which will contribute all the information needed for a typical microsimulation model. In fact many model builders have found it necessary to use guestimates of model parameters and then try to calibrate the model against known benchmarks. Calibration is nothing but an attempt to tune the unknown parameters such that the model is able to simulate reasonably well the distributions of key variables. In this respect there is a similarity between microsimulation modeling and general equilibrium modeling. Both rely too often on the calibration technique. <a href=\"#bib22\">Hansen and Heckman (1996)</a> criticized this approach because they found too little emphasis on assessing the quality of the resulting estimates. In fact the properties of the estimates are usually unknown and <i>mutatis mutandis</i> the same is true for the simulated entities. The calibration techniques also tend to hide a more serious problem, namely that typically calibration involves only one year\u2019s data or a single average or total.

Calibration to official statistics is also applied to the number of new graduates at various educational levels. Labour income is calibrated such that its rate of change agrees with the exogenously assumed rate of change. In a few cases the model is also calibrated to the expected outcome of a variable, ie the mean of a simulated variable is forced to agree with its expected value. This is done to reduce the Monte Carlo variability of the simulations.

Alternatively one could adjust the parameter estimates so the model reproduces the benchmarks. One can thus see alignment as estimation subject to the constraints of satisfying the benchmarks. It is, however, not immediately obvious how the parameter estimates should be adjusted. In the case of a linear model and OLS estimation it is a simple case of constrained estimation as demonstrated in <a href=\"#bib29\">Klevmarken (2002)</a>, and it is also possible to derive explicit expressions for the alignment factors if one prefers to adjust the simulated values rather than the parameters.

Because data came from such a small and rather special area and only applied to those who were at least 75 years old, while we wanted to use the model also for the age group 65-74, it was desirable to check the predictions from the estimated model against national estimates of old age care.

To avoid this problem the model was aligned for males and females separately but only to the totals of the three groups of care for the age group 65-74. For each gender there were thus only three constraints. Although the model was estimated for males and females jointly, we in this way got separate estimates of the parameters for each gender.

First the choice of criterion and validation measure, and second the derivation of the stochastic properties of this measure taking all sources of uncertainty into account. The choice of criterion for validation is of course closely related to that for estimation. As already mentioned, we are not only interested in good mean predictions, but also in good representations of cross-sectional distributions and of transitions between states. When an event occurs becomes important in any dynamic microsimulation exercise. A micro-simulation model is likely to have a number of simplifying assumptions about lack of correlation and independence, both between individuals and over time. For this reason one might expect more random noise in the simulations and faster decaying correlations compared to real data. In addition to model wide criteria one might thus be interested in criteria that focus on these particular properties. Work is needed to develop such measures with known properties.",

In general, micro-simulation models are so complex that analytical solutions are unlikely.

If the bootstrap samples are used not only to estimate the parameters but also as replicated bases (initial conditions) for the simulations, then one would also be able to capture the random sampling errors. In practice this advice will become difficult to follow for large models. To re-estimate all relations using many data sets is likely to become burdensome.
