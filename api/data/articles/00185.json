This paper describes a user-friendly Stata-based toolkit to perform MSs combined with CGE models in a top-down fashion. The toolkit is organized in various modules, which can be easily adapted to the users\u2019 needs. It first estimates income generation by type of work and skill of workers. Then it estimates households\u2019 specific price deflators based on individual utility. The changes estimated by a CGE model (or from other sources) in the employment (by skill and sector), in the wage payroll (by skill), in the revenues from self-employment activities (by skill) as well as in the commodities prices are fed into the MS model in a consistent way. Once the new vector of real consumption or revenue is estimated, it performs a series of distributive analysis, such as the computation of standard poverty and inequality indices, their decomposition by income factor, robustness analysis and growth incidence curves, and compare the baseline with the simulation results. This makes it possible to run standard poverty and distributive analyses, and to see whether a given shock or policy has had some impact on household welfare and who are the most affected households. Based on such information, social protection policies can be accurately designed in order to minimise the, for example, negative effects of a given shock in a cost-effective manner. An illustrative analysis is run on data from Uganda.",

Nonetheless, it may also be used to simulate the microeconomic effects of exogenous changes coming from other sources (for example, macro projections, hypothesised shocks, etc.). Very generally, a MS model is a model of the behaviour of individual agents (individuals, households, firms). As such, it can be used to simulate the effects of economic policies or other shocks on those individual agents. In this article, we focus on the impacts on individuals and households. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to make a similar toolkit publicly available, including an example application to real data.",

CGE models allow the modeller to focus on winners and losers at the sectoral level, and to estimate the impact on macroeconomic variables and general equilibrium price effects. However, they are not an adequate tool to perform distributional analysis given the lack of individual/household results and the representative agent assumption (that is, the household in a CGE model is an aggregate household and not an average household).",

They are the key methodology to capture distributional effects of a policy change due to heterogeneity at the household or individual level. However, they are not able to capture the economy-wide effects of macro shocks (international trade, tax policy, public expenditures, etc.). Furthermore, they lack general equilibrium effects. If the macro shock or policy is substantial, there will likely be consequences for income distribution, sectoral prices, factor returns, employment, labour supply, GDP, etc., which are not captured by a MS model alone. For example, the reform of a tax-benefit system is likely to affect labour supply which, in turn, may affect wages and prices. Even in cases where the shock impacts are at the micro level (for example, a cash transfer programme), if it is on a large scale it is likely to have significant macro repercussions (for example, changes in labour force participation, changes in household consumption) that may, in turn, feed back to the micro impacts.",

In this article, we adopt a parametric approach, which is the most common in the literature and, we believe, as long as the behavioural parameters are correctly estimated, it better captures observed individual behaviour.

The MS model is then used to simulate the effect on household income of modifying a subset of variables in accordance with the results of the CGE model (for example, not only wages, prices, other revenues \u2014as under the accounting approach\u2014 but also employment status).

Dynamic simulations, in the form of repeated simulations of the household income-generation model for period-specific changes in the shock variables, would require adding a population-ageing model to the MS model. For instance, this may require a MS model that ages the population over time using estimated or calibrated functions for fertility, mortality, migration, marriage, household formation, schooling, etc. (see for example <a href=\"#ref11\">Grimm, 2005</a>). It is useful to consider that, when combined with a dynamic CGE, the MS model should take into account the evolution of the population. This can be done by \u201csampling re-weighting\u201d techniques or by changing the attributes of the individuals. We can in fact distinguish between \u201cstatic ageing\u201d (sampling re-weighting) and \u201cdynamic ageing\u201d. Under the former, sampling weights are modified so that the simulated population matches the macro aggregates. This approach is usually used in the short-to-medium run as no significant alteration in the population structure is expected. A well-known technique is the algorithm developed by <a href=\"#ref10\">Deville and S\u00e4rndal (1992)</a>. With the \u201cdynamic ageing\u201d technique, real life events (for example, birth, death, etc.) are modelled and, based on that, individual and household characteristics are updated at each period. These approaches are often combined with calibration mechanisms to align micro aggregates with macro forecasts.",

For example, individuals may change position in the labour market (and hence also affect household income) due to external shocks, trade reforms, or other policy changes. In turn, workers may shift from one sector to another, change occupation or lose their jobs. From a practical point of view, the methodological issue is to find a procedure that can account for such labour-market shifts and identify which individuals are most likely to shift position in order to be able to simulate a new, counterfactual income distribution. In addition, our MS model also considers changes in commodity prices through a household-specific consumer price index.",

For this illustrative example, the simulation period is from 2011 to 2030. The variations fed into the MS model have been estimated through a CGE model, which simulated the baseline scenario and a policy scenario simulating large investments in the oil sector in Uganda. For the baseline simulation, forecast data (regarding GDP growth and population growth) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are used. Regarding the policy scenario, the first phase of the simulation (2015\u20132017) concerns large investments in the oil sector when there is no production from this sector. This is followed up with a construction phase from 2018\u20132030. In this second phase, the oil sector generates production, and profit and labour income generated in the oil sector goes to Ugandan households. It is also in this phase that profits and labour payments are generated. In this simulation, we assume that that foreigners fund the investment in the oil sector (as a \u201cgift\u201d from the rest of the world to Uganda).",

As said earlier, the simulated policy intervention starts in 2015. The short to medium term impact on household welfare and poverty is negative, as detected by the upward jump in 2015 (or year 5 of the simulation) for both the incidence of poverty and the poverty gap. Specifically, the proposed investment would cause a rise in the incidence of poverty by 2.5 percentage points and by around 1.3 percentage points in the poverty gap. In other words, such a policy would push back the poverty indicators to their 2010 value. In the long term, the baseline and reference scenarios tend to converge.",

While the simulated changes in the income from the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors do not substantially affect the poverty difference, variations in wage would reduce poverty under the simulation scenario (with respect to the baseline) by around 0.5 points. Between 2016 and 2021, the change in agricultural income would negatively affect poverty (with respect to its baseline counterfactual); after that, it would slightly decrease or have no effects on poverty. Income from non-agricultural self-employment would help \u2014though marginally (0.2\u20130.4 points a year)\u2014 decrease poverty from 2018. Wages would help to reduce poverty along the entire period by 0.2 to 0.8 points a year.

The change in consumption is indeed always negative, with those in percentiles 40<sup>th</sup> to 80<sup>th</sup> being particularly affected (up to -8%), and with those below the poverty line experiencing a 6% reduction. In later periods, richer percentiles (around the top 10%) would have higher income than under the baseline; in contrast, lower percentiles would continue to experience some reduction, though at a smaller rate over time (about -3% in 2020, -2% in 2025 and -1% in 2030) and without significant differences between those lying below the poverty line and those above.

TDB\u2019s main final outputs are standard poverty and distributive indicators and graphs resulting from the introduction of a given shock or policy. TDB\u2019s main goal is to help understanding the direction and the magnitude of the impact of a given shock or policy on households along the whole income distribution. Based on such information, social protection policies can be accurately designed in order to minimise the, for example, negative effects of a given shock in a cost-effective manner.
