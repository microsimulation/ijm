This is not universal. For example, regulatory authorities for insurers now want information on the range of possible results, including unlikely but costly disasters. Many investors want to understand the risks and potential returns from each investment, as well as the risk reductions from diversification. The use of alignment to eliminate stochastic variation may thus be concealing valuable information. Note however that stochastic variation during a projection may only be a minor source of overall uncertainty. Uncertainties inherent in the estimation of model coefficients, and changes over time in individual behavior, government policy and economic conditions may be much greater sources of uncertainty.",

This appears to be one of the risks of using alignment, where a major underlying error may lead to a variety of distortions. A wide range of problems can cause microsimulation results to differ from national projections. For example, low births may result from low partnering rates or wrong age assumptions about immigrants. Wherever possible, it seems better to correct such problems early, rather than during alignment.",

By contrast, <a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a> shows that about 3 per cent of the population had the wrong household type in the first five years, and about 1.75 exits were needed to correct a type misalignment.

The average number of normal exits in the first 5 years was about 8,000, which was about 14 per pool. Each exit is both a departure from a pool and an entry into another, so that on average each pool had about 28 exit changes a year. The net movement of persons in or out of the pool may be distributed about N(0,5.3), and the average number of misalignments may be about 4.2. This suggests that about 2,400 misalignments a year might occur if there were 576 equal alignment pools. <a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a> shows an average of 5,314 misalignments a year, and this higher number may reflect the considerable disparity in the numbers of expected exits from each of the alignment pools.

For each female in turn, a random number is drawn, and a match made if the number is less than the calculated probability. As a result of the normalization, a match is always found. This process was implemented in CBOLT, apparently on a batch basis. INAHSIM selects equal numbers of males and females to be married, sorts both by age, them merges (<a href=\"#bib14\">Inagaki, 2009</a>). SESIM randomly selects females in a region to be married, and creates a pool of all eligible males in the region. For each selected female in turn, a male 3 years older is selected. If no such male can be found, age differences of 2 to 4 years are considered (<a href=\"#bib25\">Petterson, 2009</a>).",

Good matches are first made for those hardest to pair off, with pairing proceeding in order of decreasing difficulty. Although this algorithm did extremely well in terms of not creating marriages with extreme age differences, it also generated far too many marriages in which the husband is a single year of age greater than his wife. The authors suggested that the poor quality of the compatibility measure used prevented any true testing of matching procedures. Matching by order of decreasing difficulty is being used by PENSIM2, and by LIAM-based models such as SMILE (<a href=\"#bib20\">O\u2019Donoghue, Lennon &amp; Hynes, 2009</a>) and MIDAS (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dekkers et al., 2009</a>).",

As soon as a male or female is simulated to marry, all the potential marriage partners for that person are identified. One of these potential partners is then randomly selected, with a procedure where a partner\u2019s probability of selection is proportional to their probability of marriage to the person. Although this procedure appears similar to stochastic matching, there are important differences. Probabilities have to be those for marriage to randomly selected single persons, rather than to persons already selected to marry. The numbers of potential matches are much higher, so that calculation times can be much longer than for stochastic matching. As batches are not used, there is no problem with the last matches being unlikely.",

The published data show the cross-classified ages of brides and grooms in single-year age groups up to 54, then 55\u201359, 60\u201364, and 65 and over. In addition, the ages of males marrying are shown in single years up to age 74, then 75 and over, as are the ages of females marrying. The data showed very few persons marrying below age 18, and these persons were omitted from analysis, leaving 1,05,372 marriages. To fill the data gaps over age 54, it was assumed that, for each age of a male at marriage, the ages of brides were normally distributed. Normal distributions for each male age were obtained by minimising the sum of the squares of differences of the actual and fitted numbers for each single age or age-group. While this Australian data only contains ages, it is sufficiently detailed to test fitting methods, and to identify matching methods unlikely to work with more complex data. Its simplicity made it possible to write fast algorithms to exhaustively test different matching methods. The mean age differences in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, and their standard deviations, were obtained from the actual one-year data were available, and from the fitted normal curves where one-year data were not available. The mean age differences show that very young males tend to marry females a little older than themselves. After age 23 males become progressively older than their brides, with the estimated age difference being 6.8 years for males aged 54. The fitted standard deviation of female ages for males aged 18 is 3.9 years, dropping to 2.5 years at age 19, and then climbing to 7.6 years at age 54. The low numbers of persons marrying after age 54, and the unavailability of single-year data, create very wide confidence limits for the estimates for males over 54. The mean age difference and its standard deviation may in fact continue to increase with male ages well past 54.",

Initial misalignments are inevitable with census samples, and a systematic process for correcting them is needed. Alignment of person types during projections can produce large numbers of household changes, exaggerating household instability. The larger the numbers of alignment pools for person types, the more household changes will be needed for alignment. If approximate type alignment will suffice, this can be done by adjusting exit assumptions until the desired person type distributions are approximately obtained. In general, state alignment is much harder to do than event alignment, and if over-ambitious can cause severe distortions.",

Probability-weighted matching can be greatly speeded by limiting the sample of potential partners to about 30, without much loss of fidelity. Immediate matching seems likely to give better matching and shorter run times, particularly when used with large populations, multiple regions and short time cycles.",
