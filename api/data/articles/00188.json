The model we use for simulations is a behavioural general-equilibrium <i>what-if</i> model. We analyse the simulated impacts of consolidation strategies on growth and on fiscal balance (both in short- and long- term). The microsimulation approach allows us also to evaluate the distributional impacts. In addition, the approach permits to compare the statutory with the resulting tax incidence in the long-run. We simulate strategies based on taxing labour income, taxing consumption as well as cutting expenditures on social transfers. We document that corporate and labour taxes are more unfavourable to output growth, while consumption taxes belong to less damaging instruments for consolidation. We show that spending cuts may promote employment and are not detrimental to output growth.",

In response to these undesirable developments, most governments in the advanced economies have already introduced extensive strategies to achieve fiscal consolidation to alter this unsustainable development.

Most of the academic papers look at the aggregate economic implications, like the overall impact on employment or output growth, but usually do not take into account implied distributional effects or the influence on income inequality. Several these studies present evidence that spending based adjustments, like cuts in government spending or transfers to households (including pensions and social benefits), are less detrimental to future economic activity than increasing taxes. A survey of this strand of literature can be found in <a href=\"#bib1\">Alesina and Ardagna (2010)</a>. More evidence reinforcing and supporting these ideas can be found in <a href=\"#bib23\">Leigh, Devries, Freedman, Guajardo, Laxton, &amp; Pescatori (2010)</a> or Alesina and Ardagna (2012). On the other hand, <a href=\"#bib17\">Figari, Paulus, and Sutherland (2015)</a> use static microsimulations to show the importance of the interactions between various consolidation strategies and the income distribution. Inappropriately, this aspect has been often overlooked in the macroeconomic  literature. They  find that as an immediate effect of the consolidation, richer households tend to bear greater burden when taxes are increased, while low- income households are more affected by spending cuts. As an alternative approach, <a href=\"#bib9\">Cournede, Goujard, and Pina (2013)</a> present a qualitative framework designed to rank fiscal consolidation instruments. The ranking reflects some kind of compromise between adverse side-effects of consolidation on growth (short- and long-term), income inequality as well as on external imbalances.",

The approach that we are using allows us to consider the interactions between the setup of consolidation instruments and households\u2019 distribution of income. We show that increase in labour taxes is less detrimental to output growth than increase in consumption taxes. Due to the statutory settings of the Slovak tax system, lower-income households tend to bear greater burden when income tax allowances are reduced, while richer households are more affected by tax rates increases. Spending cuts reduce directly households\u2019 disposable income and thus are more likely to influence the lower part of the income distribution. Considerable labour supply reaction at the extensive margin increases employment in the long-run, and we show that spending cuts strategies do not destruct output growth.",

It is assumed that the process of searching for new employees is costly and for the unemployed it takes time to be matched to a new job. The standard Cobb-Douglas production function is used to match the unemployed and the vacancies. Thus, the model is consistent with the existence of involuntary unemployment. Due to high openness of the Slovak economy, the capital supply is assumed to be exogenous, capital is provided by the international capital market. In order to analyse the corporate income tax, we assume that accounting profit of firms equals to output minus labour and hiring costs (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anagnostopoulos Atesagaoglu, &amp; Carceles-Poveda, 2014</a>).

Direct taxes from labour and most social transfers are almost fully covered by our tax-benefit microsimulation model SIMTASK, so the corresponding scaling factors are reasonably close to one. However, the indirect value added tax is not completely covered in our model for two reasons. First, in our modelling framework the consumption of private households is simulated, so the consumption and VAT payments made by enterprises or public sector are outside the scope of the model. The second reason is that the household surveys significantly underestimate aggregate disposable income and consumption in the economy by 40\u201350%, once compared to national accounts statistics (see the discussion in <a href=\"#bib16\">Fesseau, Wolff, and Mattonetti (2013)</a> on the differences between micro and macro data sources). Thus, to evaluate economy wide impacts of consolidation strategies on the revenue from value added tax in the context of Slovakia, the simulated effect must be almost doubled (detailed in our related discussion study by <a href=\"#bib30\">Siebertova, Valachyova, Svarda, &amp; Senaj, 2018</a>). Moreover, the usage of a scaling coefficient depends on the consolidation instruments applied in a particular scenario.

This contributes to the overall effective labour decrease in all three scenarios. Firms react to the decline in labour supply by raising wages which results into higher attractivity of being economically active. The highest decrease of labour supply occurs in the case of one-tax rate scenario and it also drives the highest increase in gross wages. A drop in effective labour goes hand in hand with a drop in the output of the economy. Lower output and higher labour costs result into the decrease of profits. Thus, the revenue from corporate income tax falls. Note that in the long-run the tax burden is distributed and falls partly also on employers. On the contrary, thanks to the growth in income base, the revenue from payroll taxes rises.

In order to study the effects on households\u2019 budget, we define similarly like <a href=\"#bib26\">Pestel and Sommer (2017)</a> a quantity called post-VAT income that equals to household disposable income minus paid VAT. It can be understood as the virtual monetary amount left for the consumption after VAT has been paid. Both, increase in income and consumption taxes lead to a drop in post-VAT income of households. While income tax rate growth reduces net wage, the consumption tax reduces real value of net earnings and social transfers. Summing up, the motivation to work of individuals is reduced by both forms of taxation. On the demand side, the firms react to decline in employment by raising wages, their labour costs increase and the overall output decreases.The microsimulation approach allows us to consider in detail the effects of different forms of taxation on different population subgroups. Income tax system in Slovakia with two tax rates and a gradual phase-out of tax allowances is a progressive system. On the contrary, value added tax, when measured as a percentage of disposable income, exhibits a clearly regressive pattern (see <a href=\"#tableb2a\">Table 2.1</a> in <a href=\"#bib25\">OECD, 2014</a>). When the behavioural reaction of individuals in the two scenarios of 1 p.p. increase is compared, in the scenario with income tax rate increase, mainly higher-income groups react and reduce their motivation to work. On the other hand, when value added tax is increased, the motivation to work of low-income groups decreases more (see <a href=\"#tableb3\">Table B3</a> in the Appendix).

It turns out, that the employers shift the tax burden to employees (lower net wages). In case of the scenario increasing CIT rate, the employers decrease wages only marginally, but they significantly reduce capital. Consequently, the firms bear the increase in tax burden via lower net profits. Despite the different reaction on the employers\u2019 side, the model predicts very similar decline of output.

In the long-run, following high labour supply response, the employment rises and firms  react by decreasing wages. This results into the decrease of unit labour costs. Consequently, the output of the economy and profit of the firms rises. The government revenues from corporate income tax rises as well. A note on the interpretation of this result need to be made at this point. A significant reaction of the extensive margin followed by an employment rise should be considered as an upper bound of the effect. We argue that the decision of the inactive individuals to enter the labour market is not always driven only by financial motivation, modelled in our framework, but also by other factors that are not captured in our model. Therefore, in reality, it can be expected that the reaction would be lower. To sum up, in opposition to the strategies on the revenue side, the analysed spending cuts strategies are not detrimental or even promote the long-run economic growth.

The question of their appropriate mix is still open and the practise varies across countries. There is a growing consensus in the literature that no one-size-fits-all approach exists (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cournede <i>et al</i>, 2013</a>) and that economic and social situation of countries should be considered by adjusting the usage of consolidation objectives. When tax and spending cuts policies are designed, the impact of fiscal adjustments on the aggregate macroeconomic performance is of great relevance, as well as a balance between distributional and efficiency objectives. This analysis provides an evaluation of the effect of selected benchmark consolidation measures on fiscal stance, economic growth and income inequality in Slovakia. Our approach combines the microsimulation analysis that allows to evaluate the impact of the individual policy instruments separately and their incidence along the households\u2019 income distribution, to simulate the behavioural reaction on the labour market and finally to provide an assessment of the long-run general equilibrium effects. We find a considerable variation in terms of magnitude and implied effects of the tested instruments. The amount of the deficit reduction naturally varies depending on instruments chosen. Our empirical results confirm that taxing labour and consumption has both a negative effect on individuals\u2019 motivation to work, but in the long-run increasing labour taxes is more detrimental to employment and output growth than taxing consumption. We analyse the distribution of the tax burden between employers and employees when the consolidation is driven by an increase in employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 health insurance contributions rates. The empirical evidence confirms that the adjustment process works in the same direction, however, the output declines more in case when the statutory tax incidence is levied on employees. On the other hand, the two spending cuts strategies are not detrimental to output growth. Cuts of transfers to households enforce positive reaction of the labour supply and in the long-run employment grows.",

An important topic might be to test such reform packages that are revenue neutral, but not detrimental to income inequality. Finally, we have not considered the consequences of the measures from the perspective of the intertemporal consumption decision of households. At the same time, we have assumed,through an appropriate functional form for welfare, that policy decisions have no wealth effect on the labour supply. This allowed us to solve for the labour market dynamics independently of the household's consumption decision. Anticipated changes in the net income may have significant wealth effects. The full implications of these should be taken into account when evaluating the overall effects, including budgetary impacts, of the measures. This is an important extension of our framework which will be addressed in our future work.",

Individuals are subject to the personal income tax (PIT) and the joint taxation of married couples is not permitted. PIT is levied on gross income including wages from employment, self-employment income, fringe benefits, capital, rental and interest income. Social and health insurance contributions (SIC) are exempt from the tax base which is given as gross earnings net of paid SIC. Deductions from the tax base include basic tax allowance, spouse tax allowance and child tax credit. Every individual is entitled to the basic tax allowance that is defined based on minimum subsistence level. A progressive reduction in its amount applies when earnings exceed the threshold value. If earnings of a spouse are under certain level, the tax payer can apply for a spouse tax allowance. In addition, one spouse may claim child tax credit, an allowance for every child in the household. Income tax is calculated by applying the appropriate tax rate schedule to tax base. Basic tax rate is set to 19 per cent and 25 per cent rate is applied to incomes exceeding the threshold. However, this threshold is sufficiently high, so the higher tax rate relates in our estimation sample to less than 1 per cent of employees.",

Their extension of the standard labour supply model built on the rationale of utility maximization (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hausman, 1981</a>) allows to consider taxes and social transfers simultaneously. When using the categorization of labour supply models within microsimulation framework provided by Aaberge and Colombino (2014), it can be classified as a \u201cmarginalist\u201d approach. Using this static setting, the savings behaviour is not modelled. The applied set up leads to a re-definition of the reservation wage (the threshold to accept a wage offer) at the cost that the participation decision is constrained to a full-time job. However, we argue that this assumption is in the context of Slovakia not a substantial restriction. As shown by EUROSTAT, Slovakia is the country with one of the lowest rates of part-time employment. In 2016 the share of part-time workers reached only 5.7 percent as opposed to 19 percent in the EU-28.",

The effective VAT rate is defined as the share of revenues from VAT paid to total households\u2019 expenditures. To simulate VAT, in the first step we create a combined dataset that integrates the information on households\u2019 expenditures from the Slovak Household Budget Survey (HBS) and the disposable income covered in SILC database. We apply a parametric imputation technique using the methodology developed by Decoster <i>et al</i>. (2014). Engel curves relating consumption expenditures to disposable income are estimated at the household level using the data from HBS 2015. Coefficient estimates are then used to impute the information on consumption to the underlying SILC dataset. In the next step, VAT liabilities are simulated using the imputed household consumption. For details, the interested reader is referred to our discussion paper by <a href=\"#bib30\">Siebertova <i>et al</i>. (2018)</a>.",
