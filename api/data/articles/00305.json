The existing studies simulating the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran, regardless of their macro or micro approaches, have been based on the principle of population homogeneity. Assuming population homogeneity in the simulation will lead to far-fetched results, as the actual population of a society is heterogeneous. This study uses a micro simulation approach and real demographic data drawn from the national census of 2016 conducted by the Statistical Center of Iran to simulate the outbreak. The conceptual framework of the National Corona Virus Taskforce Epidemiological Committee, which uses a SEIR approach, has been developed and expanded in this study to include socioeconomic, demographic, and geographical variables in the model. Total of eight policy scenarios (i.e. No Intervention, Student Quarantine, Weekend Lockdown, Inter-Province Travel Ban, Jobless Quarantine, Elderly Quarantine, Inter-District Travel Ban and Iranian School Policy) have been examined in the simulation. The results indicate, in terms of the number of population at risk, hospitalized patients, and total number of deaths, Jobless Quarantine is the most effective and No Intervention is the least effective policy option in Iran.",

Currently, there is a global pandemic of COVID-19. To assess its prevalence, it is necessary to have adequate models that allow real-time modeling of the impact of various quarantine measures by the state. It is advisable to simulate and assess organizing or planning any epidemic prevention measures before their implementation. In other words, all the possible ways of spreading a viral infection should be simulated in real time without the involvement of real people (<a href=\"#bib24\">Vyklyuk et al., 2021</a>). Simulation and modeling of the COVID-19 outbreak can prognosticate behavior of the disease and simultaneously provide planners with a picture of what to expect.

It is dynamic microsimulation which is used in population projections and to perform \u2018what if\u2019 scenario testing of policy interventions (<a href=\"#bib14\">Lomax and Smith, 2017</a>). When heterogeneous populations are used in simulation, one can not only predict the future behavior of the model, but it\u2019s also possible to test different scenarios and policy options on different population groups and compare the results.

Following its worldwide spread and two deaths in Qom city, on February 19, the Iranian officials announced the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. The virus spread was rapid in Iran and by March 5, 2020, all 31 provinces had reported infected cases (<a href=\"#bib18\">Raoofi et al., 2020</a>). The COVID-19 situation in Iran continues to evolve rapidly, with the number of individuals who have contracted the virus have increased sharply since the first case was reported around mid-February 2020. According to the spokesperson of the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education, the pandemic has so far claimed 62,999 lives in Iran (April, 2021). The pandemic caused by the spread of this virus has caused different countries to adopt policies in accordance with their conditions. These policies have been formulated and Implemented in accordance with their own circumstances.

They developed a simple dynamic model of the epidemic to provide a more reliable picture of the state of the disease based on time series data for official reports of death, recovered patients, and cumulative number of infections over time and unofficial data points including four observations about the number of Iranian passengers diagnosed with COVID-19 upon arrival in international airports, and three estimates aggregated by healthcare providers in Iran and reports by some news agencies about total cases of death from COVID-19. They estimated about 493,000 infected cases (90% CI: 271K-810K) as of March 20th, 2020. Their estimate for cumulative cases of infection until that date is 916,000 (90% CI: 508K, 1.5M), and for total death is 15,485 (90% CI: 8.4K, 25.8K).

Furthermore, in the households with an infected person, the probability is calculated by dividing the number of infected individuals by the number of the household members. For these households, the model uses the maximum of household or district probabilities of infection. In the expanded model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), the variables of district, household, population movement, population density, urban and rural status, economic and social status, age, gender, occupation, and education have been added to the original framework. As a matter of fact, early onset of the disease occurs from a few districts, hence as long as an infected individual has not moved to another district, the probability of infection in the latter district is zero which causes no prevalence. Moreover, the probability of infection within households with an infected individual may be more than other individuals in the same district. Population movement causes the spread and dissemination of the disease in different districts. Population density affects an individual\u2019s number of daily contacts. It is expected that districts with low population density, have lower number of daily contacts. In rural areas, population density is lower than in the urban areas. Employed individuals have more contacts than others and if infected, they are less likely to be effectively isolated. Educated individuals, due to their job type and health literacy level, mostly have fewer contacts (in epidemic conditions) and if infected, they are more likely to isolate. The socioeconomic status of individuals can affect the probabilities of exposure, isolation, recovery, hospitalization, and death. Age and sex can also affect the probabilities of hospitalization and death. The newly added variables are marked with green boxes and red lines in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>.",

However, a 2% sample of this census which has been published by the Statistical Center of Iran (SCI) as raw data is used in simulation. The SCI selects a 2% sample of census and publishes for public use.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> The sampling method is considered as stratified random sampling. After determining the 2% sample size for each urban/rural area of each district, households are selected. To have enough samples from less populated districts, they may contribute more than 2% to the sampling framework. Weights are used at both household and individual level to offset any over or under representation. On the basis of this process, the household weight is calculated equal to the inverse- probability- of- selection and by adjusting this weight based on the population of each sex in the urban/rural area of each district, the individual weight is defined. As a result, there are representative samples from all 429 districts of Iran in this data. For example, more samples are selected from districts with low population, but they will also be given less weight. Therefore, the 2% sample data represents the total population of Iran and its districts at the time of census (<a href=\"#bib19\">SCI, 2016a</a>). The sample size used in this simulation is 1,579,435 individuals. Considering the variable of weight in the data and applying this variable in statistical calculations, we may show indicators for the whole statistical population. Due to the 5.67% growth of the country\u2019s population since the 2016 census, all indicators related to the number of events must be multiplied by 1.0567 to calculate the value of the indicator for the current time. However, one should beware of the fact that not all population groups grow at similar rate.",

Accordingly, individuals are located in different districts of Iran, a total of 429, and in each district they are clustered within households. The population of the districts is not closed, and a number of individuals move inter-districts daily. On the day of the study, the entire population is in a susceptible to disease state. On the first day (January 21, 2020), in three districts of Tehran, Qom, and Rasht, approximately 1150 individuals (with a probability of 105 individuals per one million individual) are exposed to the disease. Due to population movement, these individuals or new patients who were in contact with the initial cases, may travel to other districts and expose the individuals of these districts to disease. Individuals in the household are exposed to the disease by the maximum of probabilities of infection at the district or household level. The population density of the districts affects the number of daily contacts. In this study, the correlation coefficient between the population density of the districts and the number of daily contacts of individuals is considered in average to be 0.4. To determine daily population movement pattern between districts, the migration matrix of the 2016 census which shows permanent inter-district migration for a five-year period (2011-16), has been used.<sup><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup> As daily movements are not recorded, the migration matrix is used as a proxy for daily movements.

In the first step, all parameters are randomly determined by a specific distribution for individuals. For example, if it takes an average of 4.9 days for an exposed person to become ill, a random number is assigned to each exposed individual. These random numbers follow a normal distribution with a mean of 4.9, and a standard deviation of 1. However, no one can have a number less than 2. The details of all parameters are presented at <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>, which are either based on available literature or agreed upon by a group of national experts. In the second step, to consider the randomness of the phenomenon, the whole process must be iterated several times. This allows not only calculation of the average parameter values as the best estimate, but also calculation of the confidence interval of the estimates (for example, with 95% and/or 80% probabilities).",

The iteration starts with a rectangular data of 1,579,435 cases and a set of necessary variables including a state variable which is set to <i>susceptible</i> state for all at day 0. At start of iteration, the R code randomly assigns the model parameters for each individual based on information provided in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>. At day 1 some cases are exposed to the infection as mentioned above. Once someone becomes exposed to the infection, s/he should pass through the conceptual framework and experience new status values determined by parameters assigned. As the model progresses to next days, it updates the status of each individual by calculating new probabilities of exposure for susceptible cases and assigning new status for exposed cases. The probabilities of exposure are calculated at both household and district levels. The maximum of the two is used in the model, however. At the end of iteration and also at each time increment, cases have different status (i.e. susceptible, exposed, infected, isolated, hospitalized, deceased, &amp; recovered). The weighted frequency of status variable by time provides daily statistics at population level. Once an iteration ends, the program starts the whole process again in a new iteration where new values of parameters for each case are set randomly.",

If the goal was to predict the course of disease in Iran, one needed to update the parameters regularly as new information becomes available.

To reach this goal, the conceptual framework of the model proposed by the Iran\u2019s National Corona Virus Taskforce has been developed and expanded in this study to include socioeconomic, demographic, and geographical variables. The simulation results of the Coronavirus Taskforce demonstrated that in the absence of new treatments, vaccines and stability of the contagious and infectivity rate of coronaviruses, the natural course of disease will continue in Iran in the coming years and is expected to affect up to 63% of population. This value is similar to the values predicted in other countries of the world. From their point of view, the most effective tool available is patient isolation to delay the severe wave of disease, so that suspected and infected patients have the least contact with healthy population and thus break the transmission chain.",

They believe that COVID-19 models which consider scenarios for policy options include key influencing factors such as role of asymptomatic cases in spread of the disease, under-reporting of deaths and cases, testing availability, and delayed diagnosis, and providing estimates for sub-national regions are more useful for epidemic control. This study has shown that most studies about COVID-19 intended to predict the upcoming situation. However, most of them were unsuccessful in evaluating and presenting policy interventions. This failure was rooted in two distinct reasons. First, using inappropriate data which did not represent heterogeneous population structure of Iran and second, making a model that considered the same probability of infection and death for all population assuming homogeneity of the entire population of Iran.",

This data allowed us not only to be able to simulate COVID-19, but also to examine various policy scenarios. After defining and investigating eight scenarios including no Intervention, student quarantine, weekend lockdown, inter-province travel ban, jobless quarantine, elderly quarantine, inter-district travel ban, and Iranian school policy, we came to the conclusion that in terms of the number of population at risk, hospitalized patients and total number of deaths, Jobless quarantine is by far the most effective policy option in preventing the rapid spread of the COVID-19 in Iran. In all scenarios, the results are compared with the first scenario i.e. no intervention. In jobless quarantine scenario, all of these people must stay at home and the probability of infection for these people will only be at the household level. This seems to be true because of some demographic characteristics of Iran such as the low employment rate for women, high unemployment rate and the high proportion of student population.
