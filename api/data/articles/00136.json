The objective to construct a model useful in the process of budgeting and fiscal forecasting has been achieved by paying attention to policy simulation details as well as to the representativeness of the underlying micro-dataset. The validity of simulated results improved significantly after the input database sample has been reweighted in such a way that the new weights replicate, among other factors, the earned income distribution and selected age cohorts directly. Innovative approaches in bringing the model closer to legislation as well as data highlight the benefits of having more user control compared with standardized microsimulation tools.",

By employing this macro, calibration uses 21 different categories in one strata and is performed on a number of household members (5 categories), 6 age categories divided by gender (together 12 categories) and 4 variables describing labour market status of a person (employees, unemployed, self-employed and pensioners). Stratification is based on NUTS3 level (8 regions).

The most important component of individual labour income are gross earnings from employment (it constitutes more than 85% of aggregate income share in SK-SILC dataset and around 90% in the official data). When the distribution of gross earnings from employment of individuals implied by SK-SILC (using original weights) is compared to the official statistics that can be retrieved from the official administrative data (in Slovakia it is a Social Security Agency (SSA) database), low-income groups and high-income groups are under-represented (the latter in fact missing) and incomes around the average wage substantially over-represented. Gross income from employment is the most important element that enters to the computation of the income tax base and its correct representation is highly important for the validity of any tax and transfer microsimulation model. Given this argument, it is beneficial to use the gross earned income as an additional calibration factor. Income as a calibration factor has been used in Slovenian EU-SILC, where calibration included also employee cash or near cash income (<a href=\"#bib9\">Inglic <i>et al.</i>, 2013</a>). A similar idea has been described also by <a href=\"#bib2\">Creedy and Tuckwell (2003)</a> who calibrated the weights of the New Zealand Household Economic Survey to take into account the number of recipients of several social transfers directly.",

The idea of using extended age categories was to correctly represent newborn (age 0), small children (1\u20133) and youth (up to 25) population sub-groups that are essential controls for the simulation of family related benefits (child\u2019s birth grant, maternity benefit, child benefit and parental allowance).",

To make the corresponding income categories comparable, in both underlying datasets the gross income from employment has been considered. For the calibration procedure two pieces of information were needed. First, decile points of income distribution given by data in SSA were computed. These decile points were used as threshold values also in SK-SILC dataset. In the second step, in every income decile (defined by decile points computed in SSA dataset) number of individuals were counted both in SSA and SK-SILC datasets and 4 additional calibration categories (in 8 strata) were constructed by grouping several deciles together (deciles 1\u20132, 3\u20135, 6\u20138 and 9\u201310).",

At the same time, we checked whether calibrated weights match the population totals and control for the standard deviation of weights (that should be low). Based on these three criteria, we discussed the estimated results and chose the set of calibrated weights.

Besides the considerations about the type of microsimulation model that was needed in terms of its capability to include behavioural responses, the mode of operation, i.e. how easy it is to incorporate and handle with it in such a model setup, where the convergence could be achieved only after numerous iterations, has been an issue too.",

The actual benefit amount is calculated as a difference between the eligible maximum of MNB \u2013 composed of social benefit, health care allowance, housing allowance, activation and protection allowance \u2013 and the income of individuals living in a household. In our simulation, we include a more precise specification of the assessed income computation (compared to baseline). Social benefit and health care allowance are set as fixed amounts, these are not simulated. Furthermore, we include a different computation of the protection allowance: in our implementation, it is based on the set of predefined eligibility conditions. The essential is the change in the definition of an individual allocation to the activation allowance. In the baseline model, activation allowance is assigned to all those, who are not eligible to receive protection allowance. However, this approach is not based on a valid legislation and as a result, it largely overestimates the assignment of the activation allowance. On the contrary, in our approach we define a set of eligibility conditions that an individual needs to fulfil in order to be entitled to draw this allowance. This gives us a set of people who potentially might take part in activation works. In the next step, we randomly draw from this predefined group a subset of individuals (who will be finally assigned to activation works participation), such that the ratio of those who participate in activation works to the total number of those who receive MNB equals, when compared to the official statistics. In 2014 this \u201crandom draw\u201d procedure is applied also to the basic allowance due to legislation changes.",

Using the calibrated weights made the corresponding ratios get closer to one.

This imprecision arises due to the broader definition of eligibility condition that is applied. According to valid legislation, also parents of university students (up to 26 years of age) studying in an internal form are eligible to receive child benefit. It is not possible to distinguish between internal and external form of university study in the input dataset. When we adjusted the simulated output and took into account that internal form of study applies to around 70% of university students, the resulting numbers approached the official statistics closely.

Overall, this resulted into underweighting of the aggregate amount of this benefit in 2011 (83% of the official statistics). Using the calibrated weights, more weight has been placed on low-income earners who are also the most likely material needs benefit recipients, and finally this led to overestimation of this transfer in terms of the amount of benefits received (19% and 27% in 2011 and 2012, respectively). These results are in line with the evidence documented in the empirical literature suggesting considerable non-take-up of means tested benefits (<a href=\"#bib23\">Wiemers, 2015</a> or <a href=\"#bib12\">Matsaganis <i>et al.</i>, 2008</a>).

In particular, although Eurostat results are also based on SILC data and use the original weighting scheme, equalised households\u2019 disposable income definition includes different components compared to definitions used by EUROMOD and SIMTASK (that are comparable). On top of that, some income sources that enter to the computation of disposable income may have different values due to the fact that they are simulated in EUROMOD and SIMTASK.",

In particular, results were calculated on the basis of the total equalised disposable income attributed equally to each member of the household. Disposable income is defined as a sum of all monetary income sources of all household members net of paid payroll taxes. Household members are equalised by weighting using the modified OECD equivalence scale that assigns a value 1 to the household head, 0.5 to each additional adult member and 0.3 to each child under 14.",

First, we considered issues related to the simulation of social structures themselves, i.e. we identified possible improvements (compared to Slovak component of EUROMOD) such that the national tax and benefit system can be replicated as closely as possible. At this point, a major task was to precisely replicate the valid legislation in the corresponding years. At the same time, we inspected the used micro dataset in great detail and we compared it with appropriate administrative statistics. We re-weighted the input data sample such that the new calibrated weights replicate, among other factors, also the earned income distribution and selected age cohorts directly. Hence, the validity of simulated output was interpreted further in light of differences between simulations using original and new weighted survey data on one side and the official statistics on the other side.",

However, some distortions when using calibrated weights result too. These involve mainly non-simulated transfers with a lower number of recipients (and in lower total volumes) such as benefits for orphans, disabled or maternity benefits. Weights calibration helps SIMTASK to become a more convincing tool to simulate and evaluate ex-post and ex-ante the impact of selected tax and transfer system policies. However, we showed that re-weighting is not a panacea and the focus of further analysis that user is interested in is of relevance.",
