Using a rich administrative dataset with extensive information on individual earnings histories, we evaluate the impact of the scenarios for the individuals as well as the system as a whole. Our main metric for these analysis is the notion of accrued to date pension rights, i.e. the pensions rights that would be due if the system were shut down today and all accrued rights under current legislation were honoured. Our analysis illustrates that partial reforms have limited effects, both in distributional and in fiscal terms. To achieve more substantial effects, a more comprehensive approach is needed. Regional differences within the country are mostly due to differences in regional GDP rather than the pension system itself.",

While some issues are purely crisis-related, others are more structural and overall harder to address (consider the issue of increased longevity combined with early retirement). The Belgian pension system is no exception to this rule, and thus a thorough study of it and possible reforms to it seem more than warranted. Our approach is to focus on a set of hypothetical reform scenarios rather than follow the reform as recently initiated by the Di Rupo government.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> While this focus on hypothetical reforms scenarios might at first look like reducing the relevance of the research, it actually enriches the debate as it illustrates the impact of a much wider set of policy measures going well beyond the current reform compromise \u2013 that will for sure not be the final stage of the pension reform process.",

One is to rely on macroeconomic aggregates, and consider a simple overall effect of changing major pension rules. The second one is to focus on the population\u2019s real earnings and career history to determine how various reforms affect not only the aggregate economy but also each individual. The present paper follows the second approach. We use an administrative dataset characterized by a large sample size and detailed information regarding the numerous parameters that enter the pension formulae of the various pension systems in Belgium. The data allows a multi-faceted analysis of how various scenarios will impact the pension system in terms of costs, but also in terms of distributional outcomes. We consider two dimensions. First, we explore how various reforms scenarios impact on the average pension entitlements of individuals of different age cohorts. This has immediate consequences for the aggregate (fiscal) cost of the pension system \u2013 and we also present estimates of shutdown costs of the current pension systems. Second, we consider the distributional consequences of reforms on the population using a variety of inequality indicators. One specific form of distributional analysis we perform is decomposition by region (Flanders, Wallonia, Brussels) to illustrate potential redistributive and fiscal consequences of a de-federalization of the system.",

First, the rules on minimum pensionable earnings by year of work are removed while the minimum pensions are maintained. De facto, this means that only the wage earners will be affected by the change. Second, all assimilated days are neutralized in the computation of the average career wage, i.e. earnings are no longer imputed for periods on social benefit receipt. Finally, pension benefits are computed on the best 35 years of career and the required length for a full career is also reduced to 35 years instead of the currently applicable 42 to 45 years. By shortening the period, negative life events are buffered differently than at present as low or no earnings years drop out to a larger extent.<sup><a href=\"#fn15\">15</a></sup> Thus the pension formula for Reform 5 reduces to",

Indeed, given a constant number of working years, individuals are mechanically closer to achieving full benefits after the reform than before. While this basic trend also holds true for older cohorts, a second (and opposing) factor ends up at first offsetting and then dominating the first one as age increases. The reason is that as people approach the normal retirement age, more and more of them will have spent or will be spending time on social insurance programs before reaching the normal pension age. Average pension entitlements will thus decrease with age as a consequence of Reform 5 as these periods (on e.g. unemployment and early retirement programs) are no longer included in the earnings record.

For example, the Reform 1 clearly targets one-earner couples. As men are traditionally the single earners in such households, the percentage of losers and the distribution of losses follow logically. Reform 2 (no minima) has the opposite tendency and affects women more strongly than men, both in terms of the percentage of losers and the absolute loss. It means that women (with sufficiently long careers) are more likely than men to benefit from these top-up mechanisms because of their lower earnings levels. Reform 3 (no imputed earnings) and 4 illustrate the current system\u2019s bias towards men, as they disproportionately benefit from early retirement possibilities and thus are the major beneficiaries of the imputed earnings regime. Finally, <a href=\"#table4\">Table 4</a> documents that a more fundamental transformation like in Reform 5 (career length) can have positive consequences for women as compared to men. The results are less gender-biased with women and men having similar profiles of losses while women have substantially bigger average gains than men. <a href=\"#fig5a\">Figures 5a</a> and <a href=\"#fig5b\">5b</a> confirm these observations as baseline ATD pensions vary substantially according to the sex, and the various reforms affect both sexes in very different way.",

The reason is that they disproportionately benefit from the shorter averaging period and career length requirement of Reform 5: their wage profiles are generally steeper and careers usually shorter than those of lower income people, hence the result. At the other end of the spectrum, lower income people would have lower pensions because the imputed earnings for periods on social insurance would no longer be recognized in the same generous way.

Some frequently discussed reforms such as a change in the rules regarding the accrual of pension rights by means of imputed wages or even changes to the minimum pensions have little effect when introduced individually. Though this finding might surprise at first, it is simply the result of the largely complex interplay of the numerous parameters in the pension formulas of any individual pension system, but also the effects across pension systems. As such, the effects of partial and targeted parametric reforms are likely to be buffered by other correlated variables that also enter the pension computation formula. Our analysis shows that a comprehensive approach involving several parametric changes is likely to generate the largest effects, both at the individual level and the aggregate fiscal level. Specificities heavily depend on the policy choices, with some reforms more heavily affecting the fiscal side, while others have a significantly stronger effect in terms of distribution. Our results also suggest that the recently passed government measures on imputed incomes for periods of inactivity \u2013 which are significantly less drastic than ours \u2013 will likely have very limited effects, both in budgetary and distributional terms.
