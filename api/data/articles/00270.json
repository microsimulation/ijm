We adopt a microsimulation approach to assess the effects of COVID-19 on household welfare. Welfare fell by 34.2% to 41.9% between March and June 2020. Over the same period, the poverty headcount and the Gini index increased by 9 to 10.5 percentage points and 0.4 to 0.6 points respectively. The number of poor people increased by 2.8 to 3.2 million. The hardest-hit sector was education, with agriculture, forestry and fishing, trade and repairs, manufacturing, and other services also affected. The effects vary for men, women and children. While women experienced the largest decline in welfare, men experienced the highest increase in poverty incidence. The three policies selected reduced poverty marginally but were unable to offset the increase in poverty that occurred between March and June. The estimated cost of the three policies is GHS3.7 billion excluding administrative costs, which equates to approximately 1% of 2020 GDP.",

Since Ghana recorded its first two confirmed cases on March 12, 2020, the various containment measures put in place by the Government of Ghana, as announced by the President in his first national address include: social distancing measures; travel restrictions; the compulsory wearing of \u201cnose masks\u201d (also known as face masks); enhanced testing; contact tracing and further testing; the suspension of all public gatherings, which resulted in the closure of all schools and universities; and mandatory quarantine (for at least 14 days) for all people arriving by air on the night all borders closed. After the four-week period of partial lockdown in the Greater Accra and Ashanti regions and Kasoa Township, the government started gradually easing restrictions, with public gatherings again being allowed, initially for a maximum of 25 people, and later, 100 people.",

Given that most of the Ghanaian working population is in the informal sector, the economic implications of the lockdown measures on this subset of the population remained a major challenge and forced the government to lift lockdown restrictions even when the number of infected cases was increasing. The easing of lockdown measures despite a surge in infected cases at the time was a common phenomenon, as the poor and vulnerable people were more likely to die out of hunger than the virus itself. Thus, the large informal sector, in Ghana, and the many daily wage earners, who have little or no savings, made it very difficult for the government to enforce a total lockdown of the country. This is because, for the many daily wage earners, a total lockdown implies no work and hence no income and no access to food or other household necessities. More importantly, the informal sector often consists of small and informal businesses, which are a source of sustenance and livelihoods for many, particularly the poor (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gondwe, 2020</a>). In lieu of the loss of work and income, the Government of Ghana instituted the provision of free water for household and commercial use, cooked and uncooked food, and tax holidays, among other economic recovery measures, to lessen the impact of the lockdown on citizens (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ozili, 2022</a>).",

The results show that adjusting for food price variations across regions that were and were not under lockdown, leads to marginal differences in the results. For instance, consumption falls by 34.2% in the absence of regional price variations. However, when average food price variation for March to May 2020 is used, the reduction in consumption was 34.8%. Using the higher April price increases yields an increase of 36.3%.

We consider the results to be a lower bound for the pandemic\u2019s impact due to the assumptions made and the fact that the effect could be larger if some of the channels through which the pandemic affects households were not captured. Increasing the period of analysis to December 2020 yields much lower impacts, and in some cases, a marginal reduction in poverty is observed. However, the reduction is not enough to offset the initial increase in poverty or reduction in welfare.

The reliefs for health professionals benefitted women more than men. We observe a relatively larger reduction in poverty for women than men. If we compare the effects of all three policies, poverty decreases relatively more for men than women. Our simulation of the proposed 50% fee reduction for public university students shows the policy reduces poverty marginally and relatively more for men than women. One conclusion from our simulations is that the three policies implemented reduced poverty only marginally, less than 1 p. p. in all cases. This reduction is not adequate to offset the increase in poverty due to COVID-19.",

The largest impact is provided by the water and electricity subsidies applied in the first three months, which reduce the number of poor people by 260,947. This shows the importance of the water and electricity subsidy (which was universal in nature) in cushioning some of the pandemic\u2019s impact on households. However, the nine months of water and electricity subsidies reduce the number of poor people by 93,594. The creative loans, which had the lowest impact, reduce the number of poor people by 1,240.",

We therefore see our combined costs of the policy, of GHS 2.69 billion (or 0.73% of 2020 GDP), as a lower bound estimate. The loan to creatives is estimated to cost GHS 33.38 million. However, since repayment from beneficiaries is expected, this will not be a long-term cost for the government. The health workers\u2019 reliefs was estimated to have cost GHS 918.18 million. The policies simulated must be scaled up and used in conjunction with additional policies to ensure a stronger reduction in poverty and inequality. Furthermore, the total costs of all three policies will increase the budget deficits by a minimum of GHS 3.7 billion, which is equivalent to 1% of 2020 GDP. The cost per poor person lifted out of poverty was lowest for the free water and electricity policy (GHS 13,362 to GHS 20,596) and highest for health sector reliefs (GHS 329,688). Even though the absolute costs of providing free water and electricity was the highest, it achieved a much lower cost per person after accounting for the reduction in poverty due to the policy.",

We provide a possible explanation for our results; however, a caveat is that microsimulation results tend to rely heavily on the assumptions made in the analysis. As a result, explanations have to take into account the assumptions made and the mechanisms through which the effects occur. One possible explanation for the lower incidence in the locked down areas could be because men, women and children in the non-locked-down regions found themselves relatively closer to the poverty line and therefore more vulnerable to poverty and more likely to become poor due to the COVID-19 shock. Another possible reason could be that the reduction in transfers from migrant families living in the regional capitals of Greater Accra and the Ashanti region allowed some households to rely on their savings and therefore fewer to reach consumption levels closer to the poverty line. Thus, recipients of the transfers in the other regions lost a source of income that allowed their welfare to rise or stay above the poverty line.",

The same cannot be said for all the other sectors, which saw an increase in poverty among men, women and children. Those in the education sector were the most heavily affected, with men experiencing a relatively higher increase in poverty (46.4 p. p) compared to women (41.7 p. p.) and children (41.9 p. p.). The education sector was closed for almost a year except for national exam candidates being allowed to return to school later in the year to write their final exit exams. More importantly, for private education providers, the lack of teaching meant a loss of revenue and an inability to pay their teachers, unlike government-assisted schools whose teachers were paid by the government. Private universities found themselves in a similar situation, as they faced challenges resuming academic work online.",

Men, women and children in households operating in those sectors saw an increase of at least 4 p. p. in poverty headcount.

Women in the \u201cother manufacturing\u201d sector experienced a marginal decline in headcount index (-0.3 p. p.). It was not expected that those in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors would see the second largest increase in headcount poverty. However, market imperfections and the rising costs of transporting food products to and within the locked down areas might explain why the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector was significantly affected by the pandemic.",

The lower values can be attributed to the decrease in prices observed after May. Falling prices were more prevalent and prices fell faster in the locked down areas than the non-lockdown areas, which saw prices fall at a slower pace due to price stickiness and market imperfections. Also, as business activities picked up again in the locked down areas, they were more likely to be relieved of the pressure they initially experienced due to decreased income and remittances and rising prices.",

Its effect varies by sector of work, sex and area, and depending on whether the region was locked down. The hardest-hit sector in terms of welfare loss and poverty increase was the education sector. The remaining sectors, apart from the mining and quarrying sector, and to a lesser extent the \u201cother manufacturing\u201d sector, also saw higher poverty and lower welfare for men, women and children. We find that in the short term after the pandemic, those in regions that were not locked down and in rural areas experienced a relatively higher poverty incidence. If we extend our simulation to the end of the year (December 2020), the results are similar in terms of sectoral impacts and across groups (including men, women and children), with a few exceptions.",

We also added an additional policy\u2014the absorption of 50% of public university fees\u2014that was considered but ultimately not implemented by the government. All three implemented policies had some effect in marginally reducing poverty, with the highest reduction being 0.55 p. p. attributable to the provision of three months of free water and a 50% tariff reduction on electricity. The other policies reduced poverty much less due to their limited household coverage. Additional policies that directly target the poor, such as free electricity for lifeline consumers, are important to mitigate the increase in poverty due to COVID-19. Our estimates of costs indicate that the loans to creatives was the cheapest policy (GHS 33.38 million) and the free water and electricity policy was the most expensive (GHS 2.69 billion). Free water alone cost GHS 521.9 million. The relief to health workers cost GHS 918.2 million. However, when we account for the reduction in poverty, the free water and electricity policy generates the lowest costs per person lifted out of poverty of GHS 13,362 to GHS 20,596 while it is highest for the reliefs for health workers (GHS 329,688).
