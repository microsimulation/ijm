We apply a microsimulation method to calculate both static and behavioral ex-ante effects of the reform on employment, public finances and income inequality. Relying on previous empirical literature, we employ three benefit elasticity levels. Individual heterogeneity is added by weighting the elasticities with estimated employment probabilities. According to the static scenario, the reform increases income inequality, albeit marginally. Accounting for the behavioral response mitigates the effect on inequality and more than doubles the effect on public finances.",

Cuts in benefit levels are often considered damaging from the perspective of inequality. Static analyses using microsimulation models have become increasingly common in bringing forth knowledge of the distributional effects of various tax-benefit reforms (see, for example, <a href=\"#bib6\">De Agostini, Paulus, &amp; Tasseva, 2015</a>). However, neglecting the behavioral effects of a benefit cut can result in biased and pessimistic estimates in terms of fiscal and distributional outcomes. Part of the literature has taken this into account (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ball, Furceri, Leigh, &amp; Loungani, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Woo, Bova, Kinda, &amp; Zhang, 2013</a>). Discrete choice models are often used to estimate the labor supply response in a partial equilibrium setting (see, for example, <a href=\"#bib4\">Creedy &amp; Kalb, 2005</a>). Extending such analysis to the question of distribution in the context of labor supply response is not as common and involves specific challenges (<a href=\"#bib5\">Creedy, Kalb, &amp; Scutella, 2006</a>).",

Instead of using correlations discovered by a discrete choice model, we apply elasticities derived from microeconomic research to the specific group of interest. This allows us to use external information on causation and to bypass questions related, but not limited, to demand-side elements and involuntary unemployment. In addition, we refrain from the structural approach of estimating the utility function. We, therefore, are agnostic on quality and quantity of social welfare effects of the reform considered here.",
