Employing available survey data, we model the demographics of the region over the next generation, as shaped by births, deaths and international migration. The migration patterns between England and Wales and the remaining EU countries are modified according to the possible scenarios of their future relations. We find that Brexit will accelerate the overall population ageing and the deepening imbalance between workers and retirees but reduce the population growth and the fraction of women of reproductive age. In the alternative scenarios of remaining in the EU these effects will be partially forestalled by waves of immigration from current and prospective EU countries and their children. In all considered scenarios the native British population declines. Our study demonstrates that microsimulations can be a useful tool for designing and evaluating the country\u2019s policies in the advent of fundamental transformations.",

The rich multiethnic, multicultural structure of the UK society has been historically shaped by several waves of economically motivated migration, the last of which began after the accession of Eastern European countries to the EU in 2004.

(Since the available data force us to work with net migration rather than separate immigration and emigration figures, it is important to note that changes of emigration rates generally correspond to larger relative changes of net migration, possibly even changing its sign. For this reason, the <i>f</i><sub>Em</sub> values must be very high to account for realistic shifts in emigration. Additionally, <i>f</i><sub>Ret</sub> must be increased to compensate for the fact that the stock of native British emigrants to the EU accumulated in the microsimulation course does not include people who emigrated before 1991.)

The relative sampling error for ethnic, age and sex groups is negligibly small thanks to the large sample size (5 million).

Their proportion, i.e. the dependency ratio (solid line, left axis), exhibits a large dip from 2001 to 2011, caused by the simultaneous decrease in the fertility rate and the influx of EU workers. The latter also explains the flattening of the old age dependency ratio (of retirement-age to working-age persons; dashed line, right axis) in this period. After the influx subsides, and the female EU immigrants start having children, both curves pick up their previous upward trends. From 2019 onwards, the scenarios fan out, depicting differences between the migration patterns: Remain scenarios yield lower ratios than Brexit ones, in particular the dependency ratio ranges from a low of 0.62 under the \u201c2nd enlargement\u201d scenario to a high of 0.65 under the \u201cExodus\u201d scenario in 2041, whereas the old-age dependency ratio from 0.34 to 0.38.

The differences between Brexit and Remain cases, although significant, are mostly those of degree. In the constantly growing population, the median age and dependency ratios will rise, and the percentage of women of reproductive age will fall regardless of the EU membership status. These changes mostly result from the interplay between longer lifespans (compared with earlier cohorts) and lower average fertility rates, and could be partially forestalled by the influx of immigration from current and prospective EU countries and their children. At the same time, the share of native British in the E&W population will shrink, even after their repatriation and the exodus of EU immigrants after the Brexit, owing to high fertility rates of other ethnic groups. The only qualitative effects brought about by Brexit will be a temporary population size dip in the \u201cExodus\u201d scenario, a sharp increase of male to female ratio after \u201cHard Brexit\u201d and a significant increase in the median age of EU immigrant group. The above demographic changes will have important fiscal consequences both on the revenue (lower number of people of working age) and expenditure (higher medical care costs and fraction of pensioners offset by lesser demand on school and maternity services) side. Under all considered scenarios, the E&W demographics will undergo a significant transformation, which can be expected to have a strong impact on the society and politics. Its exact nature will depend on the UK\u2019s stance on immigration after Brexit. However, the presented results indicate that alleviating the growing strain placed by the ageing population on the country\u2019s social services will require additional interventions.",
