This prototype has been constructed and tested on a model of the entire population of the British Isles. Typical results are presented. A microsimulation of this order of magnitude of population simulation has not been previously attained. Further, an efficiency assessment of processor usage indicates that extension to the global scale is feasible. We conclude that the flexible approach outlined provides the framework for a virtual laboratory capable of supporting public health policy making at a variety of spatial scales.",

This rift in the global focus is counter-balanced by a fear of the emergence or re-emergence of novel infectious diseases and of the introduction of infectious diseases into regions in which immunity is low or non-existent. The current worry of a within-species strain of avian influenza is typical of the need to understand the patterns of global diseases, their emergence, spread (<a href=\"#bib8\">Galvani and May, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Lloyd-Smith <i>et al</i>., 2005</a>) and the mechanisms of transmission (<a href=\"#bib20\">Sattenspiel and Herring, 2003</a>), and by those means also the potential value of alternative interventions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chatterjee, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Ferguson <i>et al</i>., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Halloran and Longini, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Longini <i>et al</i>., 2005</a>). While some of the public fear of potential new global epidemics generated by news headlines is perhaps unfounded, the expert concern about between-species transmission is real, founded and consequential (<a href=\"#bib21\">Tran <i>et al</i>. 2004</a>). The HIV-AIDS pandemic is an example for a contact-transmitted disease, while sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an example of an air-borne disease, both diseases having made a major impact on the public horizon.",

Such mechanisms include: physical contact, sexual contact, airborne, waterborne, foodborne or vector-borne. These mechanisms are some of the most determining factors in understanding and modelling transmission. Specifically, infectious diseases transmitted through physical contact are wholly dependent on human behaviour, while vector-borne diseases require an understanding of life cycle and natural history of the vector (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hoshen &amp; Morse, 2004</a>). Waterborne and foodborne diseases (such as cholera) are usually modifiable in practice by improved hygiene and sanitation. In contrast, airborne diseases tend to be dependent solely upon close physical proximity, with transmission typically dependent upon human density, rather than upon \u2018risky\u2019 behaviours.",

Analytical solutions are elegant and general and are widely used (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson &amp; May, 1991</a>). They allow the generalisation of results to different diseases under different conditions, through the exchange of parameter values or interaction elements. They may allow the extension of the model to large populations or large areas. They can typically serve to establish conditions for a steady-state solution of the prevalence and incidence of the disease, the increase in infection rate at a single location, or the spread of disease through an isotropic homogenous surrounding. While such a model may be conceived for a disease with limited stage dependence based on a homogeneous background, there are as yet no analytical solutions for the spatial and temporal spread of disease on an inhomogeneous plane. An analytical model allowing for individual stochastic variation seems to be unattainable. One solution to this shortcoming is the use of computer simulations.",

Input data to the simulation may be based on observed data or on a limited characteristic representation. Most biological models consist of some measurable parameters which are determined by empirical data (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ferguson <i>et al</i>., 2005</a>). The simulation outputs will typically be expressed in terms of data with both spatial and temporal dimensions. While the temporal aspect is inherent to transmission models, a spatial aspect is important for models which represent either the spread of new diseases or else spatial variation due to spatially-expressed local conditions. The ability to simulate <i>in silico</i> the progression of a disease thus forms the basis for a virtual laboratory, which replaces the natural laboratory of chronic diseases. This virtual laboratory allows the evaluation of interventions to be tested, by assessing their impacts upon infection rates.",

More recent elaborations of these models describes the probabilistic flow of individuals from one status to another (e.g. <a href=\"#bib6\">Ferguson <i>et al</i>. 2005</a>). Such models, unless containing an elaborate lag structure, however, often neglect a proper representation of the time-course and allow individuals to develop an infectious status faster than biologically feasible. A more valid method is to create separate \u201chuman\u201d objects, followed individually, with dynamics that approximate those of actual humans (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen &amp; Bokka, 2005</a>). By dynamics we refer here to the ability of the <i>in silico</i> humans to move within the virtual world and interact with other virtual objects and with the process of disease. These virtual objects could include not only disease status but also individual characteristics, which may range from age and gender to genetic traits. As may be expected, this method will in general carry the computational cost of a large population structure in terms of both time and memory. In particular, to represent the behaviour of the human system at the early stages of an outbreak the size of the virtual population must be of the order of magnitude of the real population. Perhaps the closest work in this field to our own is that of Ferguson <i>et al</i>. (<a href=\"#bib6\">2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2006</a>) and <a href=\"#bib16\">Longini <i>et al</i>. (2005)</a>, both of which focus on avian influenza. Both are experimenting with large scale simulations, and have conflicting predictions of the potential risk associated with an outbreak. However, neither is targeting the global simulation of disease spread.",

Unfortunately, to fully generate the probability distribution will, in general, require many runs and huge memory and data resources. The additional complication of spatial transmission makes such models too complex for single processor machines. As a result, until now such models either compromised their geographic dynamic aspect, and simulated discrete individual locations, or else simulated only relatively small populations, either by limiting themselves to small countries (such as Sweden \u2013 c.f. <a href=\"#bib12\">Holm <i>et al</i>., undated</a>) or by scaling the population.

These adults and children are randomly allocated to homes within that town (i.e. to \u2018houses\u2019 designated as being available for occupation). Adults and children in each home are then also randomly allocated to, respectively, workplaces and schools within the town, a small proportion being randomly allocated to a workplace or school in an adjacent town. Each individual is also assigned a disease status from one of a sequence of possible states: susceptible, infected, latent (non-infectious), infectious and immune. The lengths of the latent and immune stages are variable and can be modified by disease type, as can the infection and clearance rates. In a typical model run the vast majority of individuals are assigned an initial disease status of susceptible, with only a few individuals, in a few selected towns, being randomly allocated the disease status of infected.",

The first involved grouping towns into lateral slices, the second involved grouping towns longitudinally and latitudinally. The subdivisions were geared to test the scalability of the program, the limitations regarding numbers of processors, the minimum time for a run and the use of alternative processor architectures to reduce data-swapping. For this testing we used either a 24 by 24 grid subdivided as described in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>, or a 36 by 36 grid subdivided as described in <a href=\"#table2\">Table 2</a>. In both tables the first column reports the total number of processors used in each configuration, whilst the second (third) column gives the number of towns that each processor controls in the x (y) direction.

In such scaling up a primary constraint on model execution time is the region with maximal population. The reason for this is that, in our model structure, there is a pause at the end of each time step to allow the swapping of information between regions, principally the mirroring of towns located on a regional border to the adjacent regional processor. As a result the processor dealing with the region containing the highest population, and which therefore takes the longest to complete its computational task, is the one which will dictate the pace of the simulation. This is illustrated by results produced using the 36 by 36 grid (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). As the number of processors increases, the maximal population of each region falls, thereby reducing the overall simulation time. This suggests that scaling the model from a national (British Isles) to global scale will simply require more processors.",

When sub-dividing a less densely populated region across multiple processors, the gains in computation power more than out-weigh the slight increase in communications overhead entailed. On the other hand, when sub-dividing a densely populated region (e.g. London), the increase in communications overhead, with far greater volumes of population having to be mirrored between regions, can potentially off-set any gain in computing power. This is the cause of the diminishing returns shown at work in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>, based upon results from model runs using a 24 \u00d7 24 grid. Communication overheads are also affected by the arrangement of towns within a region into rows and columns. This is demonstrated visually in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a> where, for the same number of processors, multiple points are plotted, indicating the range of run times that can arise depending upon the precise arrangement of towns within regions. (The specific regional configurations associated with each run time are shown in <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>.)",

First, provided region size is large enough to allow the modelling of major metropolitan areas on one processor, communication overheads do not play a limiting factor in model run times. Rather, scaling the model up from national to global coverage is simply a case of increasing the number of processors used. To simulate the world we estimate approximately 1000\u201310000 processors would be necessary, already within the range of some existing regional computer cluster facilities. Second, the way in which populations are distributed across processors is important. We are currently developing an algorithm that will partition the total population into equally populated regions, while allowing for boundary interfaces to be managed simply. This will sharply reduce the maximal processing speed-limit caused by highly dense metropolitan centres such as London. Of course, in a more sophisticated microsimulation, with an increase in the amount of data per individual, the limitations imposed by communication overheads would be more severe, but the lessons above still apply. In any case, we believe efficient packing of the data should limit this additional effect.",

Using currently available technology, the model structure proposed has been shown to be able to run a microsimulation of the entire UK population, and, by extrapolation (using additional processors), of a continent or the world. The model at this stage is a transmission model, with a simple \u201cblack box\u201d of transmission dynamics. This black box can be adapted to different forms of directly transmitted disease. Microsimulation modelling particularly suits the stochastic dynamics observed at the early stage of a potentially global disease, as both transmission and clearance from the individual are probabilistic, and at the individual level may cause survival or eradication of the virulent strain. On the other hand, microsimulation only seems appropriate for modelling the spread of a disease from a region with moderate prevalence to other regions when the travel rate is low. When a large proportion of the population are mobile, less computationally demanding deterministic methods are sufficient.",

Of course, in comparison to SVERIGE epidemic simulations are limited in scope, modelling only transmissible disease. Nor do these models base themselves on the type of detailed data-structure which is available to the SVERIGE group, due to the extensive data-collection system of the Swedish government, and its availability to researchers. Such personal data are rarely available in other countries, either because the data do not exist (as in developing countries) or due to regulation of data (as in most other developed countries). In addition, SVERIGE places its basic human focus on the family, a term missing in the reported epidemic microsimulations, which focus instead on the health of individuals living in households. However, these differences are not intrinsic to the simulation structure outlined in this paper, but rather are a result of our own distinct modelling goals. According to modelling need either the \u2018home\u2019 or \u2018individual\u2019 objects in our model could be treated instead as a \u2018family\u2019. Similarly, additional personal characteristics and behaviours could be factored in, either readily (e.g. earnings and taxes; family formation and dissolution; localised mortality and fertility rates), or after some additional work (e.g. matching of employees with local, regional and national job vacancies). Even the uniform grid currently utilised in our model can be simply transformed, via topological mapping, to cater for existing non-grid-based administrative geographies, tying in directly with existing census data sources without affecting model functionality (c.f. <a href=\"#bib6\">Ferguson <i>et al</i>., 2005</a>). The real difference between SVERIGE and our model is simply that of scale. Our model demonstrates how the modelled population of a geographically detailed microsimulation can be scaled up through the computationally efficient subdivision of spatial units across multiple processors.",

Inevitably, the insertion of inappropriate parameter values will necessarily cause incorrect evaluation of the impact of interventions.
