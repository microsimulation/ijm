In such an environment, dynamic population microsimulation models provide one of the most useful available modelling tools for projecting the likely future distributional consequences of possible policy changes. However, the construction of such dynamic models remains an extremely difficult and costly undertaking, and this paper reviews some of the challenges posed by the construction of dynamic microsimulation models.",

The modern welfare state today typically consists of a plethora of overlapping tax and outlay programs designed to meet multiple social policy objectives - including income redistribution and ensuring that most citizens enjoy an adequate standard of living and have reasonable access to such social services as health and education. These objectives are met through a very wide range of policy instruments, including both means-tested and universal cash transfers or service provision; means-tested and/or categorical eligibility for various tax concessions; and publicly-mandated insurance schemes or payments to be made by employers, employees or individuals. In an environment of such complexity, it is not surprising that policy makers attempt to reduce some of the risk associated with unintended or unexpected outcomes from policy change by using microsimulation models.",

In essence, in many countries there are grave doubts about the extent to which generous cash transfer programmes for retirees or highly subsidised health and aged care services will continue to be affordable (see <a href=\"#bib34\">Harding and Gupta, 2007b</a>).",

Dynamic microsimulation models were the brainchild of Guy Orcutt who, frustrated by the macroeconomic models of the day, proposed a new type of model consisting of interacting, decision-making entities such as individuals, families and firms (1957). Dynamic models try to move individuals forward through time, by \u2018updating each attribute for each micro-unit for each time interval\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Caldwell, 1990, p. <span class=\"page-number\">5</span></a>). Thus, the individuals within the original microdata or base file are progressively moved forward through time by making major life events - such as death, marriage, divorce, fertility, education, labour force participation etc. - happen to each individual, in accord with the probabilities of such events happening to real people within a particular country. Thus, within a dynamic microsimulation model, the characteristics of each individual are recalculated for each time period.",

Thus, the most recent examples of \u2018successful\u2019 dynamic microsimulation models, which are feeding directly into social policy processes, largely appear to be dynamic population models, typically beginning with a comprehensive cross-section snapshot of the population at a particular point in time (such as a census) or, in some cases, with longitudinal administrative data.",

However, in the 1980s, dynamic microsimulation languished (<a href=\"#bib10\">Caldwell, 1996</a>). In the 1990s, while static microsimulation flourished due to the great improvements in microdata availability and quality, the quantum advances in computer software and hardware and the growing complexity of government programs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Harding and Gupta, 2007a</a>), dynamic microsimulation grew more slowly. Caldwell recently pointed to some of the reasons why dynamic microsimulation effectively failed during the 1980s and early 1990s, including that the perceived benefits did not sufficiently outweigh the very substantial costs associated with constructing a dynamic population microsimulation model (<a href=\"#bib11\">Caldwell, 2006</a>).",

Such projections have played an important role in public debate and public policy in Australia, helping to stimulate a series of policy reforms designed to increase labour force participation (including a series of welfare to work reforms and superannuation tax reforms).

It is probably important for modellers to be open about just how expensive such models are to build, so that they can help ensure that other academics or government departments do not embrace such projects with unrealistic expectations. For example, the developers of the MINT, CBOLT and POLISIM dynamic population microsmulation models within the US were recently kind enough to share with the author that the total development costs of each of these models to date has exceeded US$6 million. To an external observer looking at theteams of researchers involved for at least the past 10 years in the construction of the DYNACAN, MOSART and SESIM models, budgets of this magnitude are also clearly involved.",

But now, very helpfully, an additional decade of experience in the construction and use of dynamic population MSM has been captured in a range of publications, including five published international collections derived from a series of international gatherings, including the regular Nordic microsimulation seminars, the Cambridge conference in 1998, the Maine conference in 2000, and the Canberra conference in 2003.<a href=\"#fn7\"><sup>7</sup></a> This means that new model builders have an improved literature to draw upon about what works and what doesn\u2019t, with extended debates having occurred during the past decade about such issues as how to best reduce stochastic error, how to improve \u2018marriage market\u2019 modelling, and how to most appropriately match summed micro results to external aggregate benchmarks (<a href=\"#bib51\">Neufeld, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">O\u2019Donoghue, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kelly and King, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Perese, 2002</a>).",

For example, Morrison has stressed the importance of building DYNACAN on an existing platform (the CORSIM model), along with the co-operation and collaboration with CORSIM\u2019s developer, Stephen Caldwell, as being two of the key ingredients for the success of DYNACAN (cited in <a href=\"#bib12\">Cassells et al., 2006</a>). The CORSIM methodology has not only been utilised by Canada, but also by Sweden through the SVERIGE model and by POLISIM within the US Social Security Administration (<a href=\"#bib42\">McKay, 2003</a>). Within Australia, although this is a static rather than a dynamic MSM example, it appears that the Australian Treasury has been helped in its construction of a behavioural (labour supply) static microsimulation model through access to the computer code of the Melbourne Institute\u2019s MITTS model, as well as on-going consultation with its developers (<a href=\"#bib39\">King, 2007</a>).",

Similarly, in the US, Favreault and Smith have noted the mutual benefits for both models created by the close co-operation that existed between theDYNASIM3 team located at the Urban Institute and the developers of the Social Security Administration\u2019s MINT model (with the Urban Institute acting as contractors to help develop MINT) (2004, p. 1). Sweden offers another excellent example, where the development of SESIM within the Swedish Ministry of Finance was enhanced by collaboration with such eminent Swedish academics as Anders Klevmarken and Lennart Flood.

In addition, it creates the possibility of the model feeding into the policy deliberations of players outside government, with consequent benefits for the development of sound public policy within a country. But the costs of maintenance of complex microsimulation models are so high that it is difficult to keep them alive in the long-term without the injection of substantial public funds.

It also raises questions about the number of explanatory variables that can be used with confidence within the predictive equations. For example, while one might posit a theoretical model that suggests that the likelihood of having a child depends upon mother\u2019s age, education, marital state, duration within current marital state, duration since last birth, current labour force status etc etc, there will be practical limits to the extent to which such predictive factors can be estimated from small longitudinal samples.",

In addition, they have often not allowed for possible macro-economic effects in response to government policy changes. Thus, traditionally, dynamic microsimulation models have often been \u2018dynamic\u2019 in the sense that the characteristics of individuals have been updated in each time period (e.g. a woman having a baby might be simulated to leave the labour force), rather than being dynamic in allowing feedback effects in behaviour from government policy change and macro-economic change. DYNASIM3, for example, retains the traditional structure of DYNASIM, where all of the demographic and annual labour market histories are simulated first and written out to file, and then the rules of various tax and social security programs are simulated separately (<a href=\"#bib22\">Favreault and Smith, 2004</a>).
