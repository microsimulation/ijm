An account is given of how simplified variants of these criteria were applied within TAZMOD, a static tax-benefit microsimulation model for Tanzania, in order to estimate take-up rates for these benefits. Confronted by the opaque and discretionary elements of the current benefits, we then simulate several categorical benefit alternatives which overcome many of the challenges of the current design, including a revenue neutral option that is more effective at reducing poverty and inequality. It is argued that by shifting to categorical benefits and removing the community targeting, proxy means-test, and conditionality elements, transparency would be enhanced. This would not only enable more accurate monitoring of access to and take-up of the benefits but would also enable citizens to determine their eligibility which is currently not possible.",

This requires objective rules rather than opaque or subjective discretionary processes, enabling eligibility to be measured, and the take-up and impact of the provision to be quantified. Using the case of the Productive Social Safety Net (PSSN) in mainland Tanzania, this paper explores the eligibility criteria for the cash benefits in the PSSN programme, and presents hypothetical policy reforms that could help enhance transparency.",

The intention is that this paper will provide new insights on the programme, gained through developing a tax-benefit microsimulation model for Tanzania called TAZMOD (<a href=\"#bib21\">Leyaro <i>et al</i>., 2017</a>). As such the emphasis is on the interpretation of the PSSN benefit rules and their \u2018translation\u2019 into arithmetic rules for a static tax-benefit microsimulation model. This process revealed that the PSSN eligibility criteria are complex and at times either opaque and/or discretionary. It is argued that this compromises transparency not only for those involved in the technical process of building a tax-benefit microsimulation model, but also for the policymakers, those who implement the policy, the beneficiaries, and the population at large. To address these issues, several hypothetical reform scenarios are simulated comprising categorical benefits, as an example of how TAZMOD can be used to explore policy reforms that are more transparent in terms of their eligibility criteria.",

It is funded by the Government of Tanzania and numerous Development Partners including the World Bank Group, the UK Department for International Development, USAID, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund and the International Labour Organization (<a href=\"#bib14\">ILO, 2017b</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">UNT, nd</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">World Bank <i>et al</i>, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">World Bank, 2017</a>). The PSSN is implemented by the Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) which was established as part of the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (NSGRP, also called MKUKUTA in Swahili) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ulriksen, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">UNT, 2015</a>).",

However, the programme has faced challenges. For example, a recent government verification exercise identified more than 55,000 beneficiary households that should not have been in receipt of the TASAF benefits. Of these, almost 13,500 beneficiaries were found to be \u2018not poor\u2019, 4,352 beneficiaries were local government leaders, and almost 14,000 beneficiaries were reported as being dead (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mbago, 2016</a>). More generally, and as will be discussed further below, the PSSN provides an example of the invidious challenge of determining how to distribute a small benefit (in both amount and coverage) fairly, in a highly impoverished and populous country (e.g. <a href=\"#bib6\">Devereux <i>et al</i>., 2017</a>). The PSSN also encapsulates the tensions that arise when so-called targeted social protection is considered alongside international commitments to universal social protection (e.g. <a href=\"#bib16\">International Monetary Fund [IMF], 2017</a>). As part of this broader debate, one of the \u2018targeting\u2019 mechanisms employed \u2014the Proxy Means Test (PMT)\u2014 is also under increased scrutiny, with questions being raised as to whether simpler mechanisms might be just as effective in ensuring that benefits reach poor people (e.g. <a href=\"#bib4\">Brown, Ravallion, &amp; van de Walle, 2018</a>).",

The paper does not provide an analysis of the role of different actors in the development of the PSSN policy (see <a href=\"#bib37\">Ulriksen, 2016</a>), nor of the implementation of the PSSN eligibility criteria in practice by the policy\u2019s implementors, nor of the experience of applicants or beneficiaries (on which see <a href=\"#bib45\">World Bank <i>et al</i>., 2016</a>; and regarding youth in particular see <a href=\"#bib36\">The Tanzania Cash Plus Evaluation Team, 2018</a>).

However, we note that a more precise estimate of the take-up rate is unattainable, not only because the eligibility criteria cannot be perfectly replicated within TAZMOD, but more generally because of the opaque and discretionary elements of the criteria.

First, it is recommended that the role of the community is retained in the implementation of the PSSN but modified in such a way that communities actively participate in the design of simplified criteria and monitor local implementation. This would help to promote \u2018meaningful participation\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib38\">UNRISD, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dugarova, 2015</a>) rather than promoting gate-keeper roles of selecting, scrutinising and potentially vetoing participants in the programme. Although the community role stems from the pilot which was designed using a community-driven development approach (<a href=\"#bib9\">Evans, Hausladen, Kosec, &amp; Reese, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">ILO &amp; DFID, 2008</a>). The inclusion of a Community Team may have been intended to validate and legitimize the process, it is just as possible that their involvement, at multiple stages throughout the selection process, could be error-prone and at risk of abuse, resulting in processes of gate-keeping, favouritism, patronage, elite capture, nepotism and exclusion (e.g. <a href=\"#bib2\">Arcand &amp; Wagner, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dutta, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pan &amp; Christiaensen, 2012</a>). This may generate conflict and divisions within communities, ultimately weakening social cohesion (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kidd, Gelders, &amp; Bailey-Athias, 2017</a>). A recent evaluation of the PSSN programme contains hints of such problems, with only 57 per cent of households that had not been prelisted by the community stating that they were satisfied with the process of selection, and 27 per cent of the same non-prelisted households disagreeing with the statement that selection is not influenced by personal interest (<a href=\"#bib45\">World Bank <i>et al</i>., 2016</a>). Thus, it is argued here that the community-targeting elements of the programme run counter to PSSN\u2019s guiding principles of being non-partisan and transparent (<a href=\"#bib31\">President\u2019s Office, United Republic of Tanzania, 2013</a>). As an example of \u2018devolved community-based targeting\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Devereux <i>et al</i>., 2017</a>, p. 179), the PSSN also demonstrates the potential danger of policy designers building into the system a mechanism that absolves them of responsibility for inclusion and exclusion errors.",

The conditionalities in the VCT also stem from the original pilot of the PSSN, which was designed as a community-based conditional cash transfer. The inclusion of conditions by their very nature require ongoing adherence to the conditions, or \u2018compliance with co-responsibilities\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib44\">World Bank, 2017</a>, p. 5), which can be onerous to monitor. It is also unclear to what extent sanctions for non-attendance at school are applied consistently across the programme, nor the extent to which extenuating circumstances are taken into account including household circumstances such as family illness. There is a growing recognition that conditionalities are particularly inappropriate in low-income country contexts where there are numerous supply-side challenges (e.g. <a href=\"#bib22\">Lund, Noble, Barnes, &amp; Wright, 2009</a>). Informal investigations by the authors have revealed that the supply-side challenges are considerable in the Tanzanian context and it is recommended that this is explored further.",

The authors had a unique opportunity to implement the means-test in TAZMOD without the need for use of proxies (i.e. the PMT) and so, unlike Brown <i>et al</i>. (2016), were able to simulate the means-test precisely. While such an opportunity arose during the construction of TAZMOD, it does not extend to the implementers in the field, whereas in contrast categorical targeting is much more straightforward. The PSSN\u2019s PMT is opaque because the details of how it is derived are not in the public domain. The regression analysis may well have been undertaken to a high standard, but it is a \u2018white box\u2019 in practical terms for any applicant. PMTs are increasingly being critiqued for failing to capture many eligible households (e.g. Brown <i>et al</i>., 2016; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kidd &amp; Wylde, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kidd <i>et al</i>., 2017</a>). It has further been observed that the PMT brings with it the problem of \u2018damage to social cohesion of an improperly understood and seemingly arbitrary selection procedure\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Freeland, 2017</a>). Kidd and colleagues identify three main sources of error in the PMT: in-built design errors, implementation errors, and the static nature of the test. They also observe that \u2018There is good evidence that PMTs cause social conflict in communities, weakening their cohesion, largely as a result of people\u2019s perception of them as lotteries.\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Kidd <i>et al</i>., 2017</a>, p. x).",
