For instance, so called tax-benefit models are computer programs that have the tax- and benefit rules of a country coded. This code is then applied to a sample of individuals which has all the information of incomes and other circumstances needed to compute the taxes and benefits that apply to each individual. A tax benefit model thus gives the taxes, benefits and disposable incomes of every individual (household) in the sample. These results can then be used to compute various distributions such as the distribution of disposable income, and the share of poor people in various population subgroups.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> If the purpose of the analysis is to study the consequences of a new policy, for instance a new tax scale, the tax code of the tax-benefit model is changed according to the new scale and the sample of individuals is run through the new code. The results from the new run can be compared to the old in order to evaluate the effect of the new policy compared to the old.",

The tax-benefit model uses the same sample in both runs, i.e., the same income distribution, the same demographic distributions, etc. There is thus no accounting for any adjustments to the new policy. For this reason the tax-benefit model is said to give only the first order effects of the policy change. To include behavioral adjustment people have added behavioral models to the tax-benefit model, for instance a labor supply model. Usually, this model is estimated from cross-sectional data and thought to capture some kind of steady state. The policy experiment is then considered to be a comparison between two steady states \u2013 a view which is at least debatable \u2013 while there is no information as to the time span needed to reach a steady state.",

It is a model which ages its population endogenously, i.e., it includes demographic models of births, marriages, deaths and possibly also migration \u2013 events which may or may not be influenced by policy. Typically, it also includes submodels which capture transitions from one state to another, for instance from schooling to employment, from employment to unemployment, and from employment to retirement, etc. These transitions may directly or indirectly be influenced by changes in policy. A dynamic microsimulation model thus tries to trace out the many different paths people follow through time. To the extent the model is realistic in this respect it is a better tool for policy evaluation than the tax-benefit model with or without behavioral equations, because it tries to mirror what actually happens in the economy through time. There is no need to think in terms of hypothetical steady states. Policy makers are usually interested in what will happen in the next few years or in the upcoming mandate period.",

One is not only interested in simulating the conditional mean of a distribution but the whole distribution. Typically, microsimulation studies also focus on the properties of specific population subgroups, such as single mothers or those in poverty or unemployment, and study transitions in and out of these states and the properties of people in these states. One of the major advantages of a microsimulation model is that the analyst is not confined to study the average economic man but can build behavioral heterogeneity into the model. On the other hand it is easy to aggregate the simulated output for individuals and households to any desired level of aggregation. Another advantage is that in the model the analyst can use the same policy instruments as the politicians do in real life. There is no need to use, for instance, average tax rates or typical marginal rates, one can instead use the tax schedules, thresholds and eligibility criteria from the tax legislation.",

More recently so called agent based models have been developed. They explicitly specify the properties of a number of economic agents and their interaction, for instance a number of job seekers who according to certain rules visit a number of employers to find jobs. This development has primarily taken place in an academic environment, and these models have not yet been used much in practical policy simulations.",

The main issue was to what extent students were likely to repay the loans the government made available to them. If a person had not repaid all of his/her debt by the age of 65, the remaining debt was remitted. A micro simulation approach was appropriate because it could capture the heterogeneity in student behavior (choice of study program and length of studies) as well as in labor market behavior (choice of job, earnings and interruptions of work).",

The first issue is primarily one of how population aging, and economic growth will influence the pension system. Using the demographic model, the labor market model and the detailed replication of the pension and tax systems in SESIM it is possible to trace paths of the large baby boom cohorts through the labor market into retirement. Then one can compute the assets and liabilities of the pension system to see if they balance. Economic growth is, however, exogenous to SESIM, but the model can be run with alternative assumed growth trajectories.",

Each individual in the SESIM population runs through all the boxes in the diagram starting with the demographic box. First a death probability is computed, and if a uniform random number on the interval (0,1) does not exceed the computed probability, the individual dies. Then the simulation stops for this individual. If however, the individual is simulated to live he/she continues to the submodels for adoption, migration, etc until all demographic models have been passed. The next individual then runs though the same loop until all individuals have run through the demographic module. The simulation then continues module by module until the models for health status, health care and social care have been passed by all individuals. The SESIM population has then become updated for one year, both in the sense that some people have died, children have been born, some have emigrated and some have immigrated, and in the sense that the properties of people have changed, ie they might have added a year of education, got a new job, increased their earnings, moved to another municipality, bought a house, etc. SESIM is thus a dynamic microsimulation model in the sense that the population is aged endogenously.

Whenever possible LINDA has been the data source used, not only the 1999 cross-section but the entire longitudinal data set. It is a great advantage to use the same data source for estimation and simulation. It avoids problems of inconsistent definitions of units and variables. However, the administrative data of LINDA have not always allowed us to estimate the models we needed. We then had to use alternative data sources - survey data and register data. Even if these data made it possible to estimate reasonable models, our modeling choices were still constrained by SESIM and LINDA, because if SESIM was unable to simulate all explanatory variables of a model, it could not be used in SESIM. For instance, there are no health data in LINDA and we needed to simulate health status as an input to explain sickness, retirement and utilization of health care and social care. A model for health status was thus estimated from combined survey and register data. This was a dynamic ordered probit model. The probability for a certain health status depended on past status and a number of socio-economic variables. To simulate this model we would in principle need observed data on health status in the base year 1999, which we did not have. The solution was to simulate a reduced model \u2013 an ordered probit model, which only depended on the observed socio-economic variables, and use it to impute health status for all individuals in 1999. The same model was also used for people who entered the SESIM population during the simulation.",

Taxes and benefits cannot be computed until the incomes of a household have been determined. The health module is now the last module in SESIM. Alternatively, we could have placed the health status model before or after the education module, while health care and social care are public benefits in Sweden and thus naturally comes at the end of the sequence jointly with other benefits.

When the size of birth cohorts varies the issue of redistribution between generations arises. For instance, the large post World War II baby boom cohorts had to put up with large school classes and a fierce competition to enter into universities. Their benefits per capita were thus reduced. These cohorts are now retiring and wondering if they will get the generous pensions they have been expecting. In another 10-15 years they will get to the age when they will need much more health care and social care. Will the government be able to continue providing these services?

It also includes the most important macro-economic variables such as GDP, the labor force, prices, interest rates etc. and the population by gender and age groups. The core of FIMO is an aggregate representation of the rules for taxes and transfers. The model does not allow the population to adjust endogenously to changes in taxes and benefits, but such changes have to be imposed on the model exogenously. SESIM and FIMO were run in parallel using the same exogenous assumptions about population changes, productivity, prices and interest rates. For instance, the real wage rate was assumed to increase by 2 per cent annually, the labor force participation rate was set to 80 per cent in the age bracket 16-64, consumer prices were assumed to increase by 2 per cent annually and the interest rate on financial assets was 3 per cent.

Those born in the 1930s paid relatively low taxes but were able to get the benefits of the increasing welfare state. Those born in the 1980s paid relatively little in tax because they started to work late and were assumed to retire early and use their increased longevity for leisure. The generations of the 1950s paid marginally more in taxes compared to those born in the 1940s but got more both in transfer payments and public consumption.

The project got the nick name \u201cThe old baby-boomers\u201d. Our choice of scientific approach was guided by the following considerations. We needed an approach by which we could simulate the consequences of population ageing for at least 40 years. We would thus have to rely on a demographic model which in a realistic way could age the Swedish population. Our approach must also include a detailed and realistic replica of the tax and benefit system, and in particular the pension system. The approach chosen should not only be able to simulate means, but whole distributions, and at the same time provide consistent macro aggregates. It must also be able to capture many different aspects of behavior such as labor supply, geographical mobility, demand for housing, demand for health care and social care etc, and tell us to what extent the increased demand for care will become balanced by increased labor force participation, work, incomes and taxes. We should be able to focus on selected target groups, such as the poor or those in special need of care and get estimates for these groups which were consistent with the estimates for the rest of the population. To accommodate this we needed a model structure which captured the heterogeneity in behavior of people. We also wanted to follow selected birth cohorts over time to see if their situation changed as they aged, and finally, it was important to be able to time any peak in the demand for care or in the incidence of poverty.",

But to build a new large scale microsimulation model is a major undertaking which requires a team of scientists from different academic disciplines representing various types of expertise. It takes time and large resources, which we did not have. For this reason, we looked for an already existing model which could give us a basic demographic model, the tax- and benefit system and a computer infrastructure. The SESIM model of the Ministry of Finance satisfied our demands, and we were fortunate to reach an agreement of co-operation with the ministry, which permitted us to use their model and also to extend it with new submodels. Implicit in our agreement was that the Ministry could use any additions to SESIM that we would design.",

(2008a)</a> The dependent variable is the number of days a person has spent in a hospital in a year. Most people never spend time in hospital while for a few we record very many days. The distribution is thus much skewed with a high frequency at 0. The kind of model chosen was a so called zero-inflated negative binomial model. Explanatory variables were variables capturing health status, number of inpatient care days last year, age, schooling, if divorced, relative income (individual income relative to population mean), geographical region, if born in Sweden, gender and an interaction between gender and relative income, and finally if the respondent is female and had a child less than one year old. The choice of variables was guided by previous literature and experience, see <a href=\"#bib1\">Bolin et al. (2008a)</a>. One might note that relative income was used rather than real income. In microsimulation it is often problematic to use income as explanatory variable, because if there is economic growth and the simulation is carried out for a long period, the income variable might drive the results completely at the end of the simulation period. For this reason we have frequently opted for a relative income measure.",

In the life-time budget constraint approach each individual faces a discontinuous or kinked life-time budget constraint and is assumed to choose the retirement age which gives the utility maximizing combination of leisure and life-cycle income. In the option value approach each individual is assumed to compute the expected gain (loss) in utility from postponing retirement one or more years. The hazard model approach is a reduced form approach which usually only considers information one period ahead. The probability to retire for a person who is currently active is typically a function of annual wage earnings, pension accruals and pension wealth, health status, age and gender.",

This was a way to get rid of white-collar employees and reduce the expenses for both salaries and pension contributions, which tend to increase with increasing age. To estimate a discrete choice model for the private decision to retire without taking these offers from employers into account would in general bias the estimates.

Data limitations and the fact that the main focus of our study did not require a detailed brake down of financial assets made us settle for the following groups of assets: owner occupied housing, other real estate (mostly vacation houses, farm- and forest properties, and apartment complexes), tax deferred pension savings, other financial asset, study loans and other debt.",

A geographical move implies new housing and for this reason decisions to buy a new house or an apartment were modeled and simulated jointly with these moves. Also households which remained in the same area were exposed to a nonzero risk of buying new housing. If a household was simulated to buy a new house or an apartment the market value of the property was simulated as a function of geographical area, floor area, financial wealth, income and demographic variables.

The first panel of <a href=\"#table5\">Table 5</a> shows that the average number of days in hospital per year and person 65+ will increase marginally. This is a result both of the increase in the average age of this group and of the decrease in health status. The table also shows the result of two alternative scenarios. First, we increased the health progression of the elderly by adjusting the health index for those aged 40-90 proportionally to their age minus 40 and the calendar year minus 2000 in such a way that a 90-year-old person in 2040 will have the same health as an 80 years old in the base scenario. This implies that the improvement in health comes gradually and is largest for the elderly. The result was that the average number of hospital days was simulated to decrease rather than to increase. In this scenario the death rates were, however, kept at their old age-specific values. If health status increases one might expect that the death rates would decrease. For this reason, the third scenario combines the increase in health status with a decline in age-specific death rates. After year 2010 and after the age of 35-40 each individual was assumed to have the death risk of a 5-year younger person in the base scenario. To avoid excessively old persons the death risks after the age of 100 was eased upwards towards the levels of the base scenario. The result is a rather dramatic increase in the average number of hospital days. The explanation is that we get an agglomeration of very old persons at the end of the simulation period.",

The assumed decrease in death rates might be exaggerated, but these simulations show that the results are rather sensitive to the death rates.

The table gives estimates for three years. We find that the total will increase in real terms by a factor of 3.6. To understand how much this is we should have been able to simulate the future budget for the public sector, but SESIM is not able to do it. The model, however, simulates how much everyone pays in direct taxes, and we have thus put the total of these expenditures relative to the sum of all direct taxes from the household sector. The result is displayed in the second column of <a href=\"#table6\">Table 6</a>. We find that the expenditure share will increase from about 20 per cent in 2000 to 36 per cent in 2040. This suggests that the increased expenditures for health care and social care due to population ageing will become an increased burden to the public budget.<sup><a href=\"#fn14\">14</a></sup>",

Everyone is assumed to retire no later than at the age of 65. At this age relative income lies in the interval 75-80 per cent. As the elderly age, their relative income decreases. The drop in income around the age 70 is a result of our assumption that the funded components of the pensions are paid out during the first five years. An individual can choose to have them paid out for a longer period or life-long. Had we chosen such an alternative the kink at age 70 had been smoothed. We find that the relative income of these cohorts decreases down to about 50 per cent at the age of 80. The explanation is that the pension system is \u201cfront loaded\u201d. Pensions are indexed by a wage rate index to make them follow the income changes of an average worker, but each year 1.6 percentage units are subtracted, which implies that the income standard of the elderly will deviate more and more from that of workers as the elderly age. We might also note that the curves of the older cohorts lie higher than those of the younger. The main explanation is that the younger cohorts will on average live longer and their pensions will thus have to be paid out for a longer period. Their annual pension will then have to decrease, unless they retire later.",

It is very low among working age people, just a few per cent, but increases a few years before the typical retirement age of 65. In the age group 55-65 there are relatively many on disability pension and on early old-age pension, which are relatively low. Immediately after 65 the poverty share goes down because the general old-age pension with a guaranteed minimum raises the income standard. As people grow older the poverty rate increases because their relative income standard decreases as demonstrated above. The youngest cohorts have the highest poverty rate for the same reason that they have the lowest relative income. When they get into the 80:s the poverty rate gets as high as 20 per cent.",

Simulation results are shown for the base scenario and when the maximum pension age is increased from 65 to 70 years. In 2000 the poverty rate was low, about 1.6 per cent for all elderly 65+. It was about 1 percentage unit higher among institutionalized elderly. According to the base scenario these numbers will increase to 2040. The poverty rate for all elderly is simulated to become 14.5 per cent and for those who use social care one or two percentage units higher. If the maximum pension age is increased and people chose to retire later the poverty rate will not increase as much. In our alternative scenario we would get about 8 per cent poor among all elderly and among the institutionalized about 12 per cent would become poor. These numbers are also sensitive to our growth assumption. Higher growth and lower unemployment will reduce poverty while lower growth and higher unemployment will increase it, see <a href=\"#bib13\">Klevmarken (2008b)</a> Table 20.",

Today family members and kin provide a large share of the help to elderly. Wives in particular help their husbands and daughters help their old mothers. Will this resource be available also in the future and help to ease the expected increased pressure on the public sector? To answer this question we have simulated the domestic migration between different parts of the country and measured how closely children live to their parents. A necessary condition for being able to help one\u2019s parents on a more regular basis is that the child lives within commuting distance to the parent. <a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14</a> shows how the share of elderly who live in commuting distance from the nearest child will decrease. The explanation to this result is that geographical mobility has increased. Young people move to get education and never return home, and young people also leave the rural areas and move into the major metropolitan areas, where it is easier to find a good job. When we looked more closely at the numbers behind <a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14</a> we found that the share of single fathers and mothers who lived close to their children was smaller than the share of couples. Unfortunately, singles are in more need of help than couples. Our simulations thus suggest that we cannot expect children to do more for their parents than they already are. On the contrary, they can rather be expected to do less.",

In the case of SESIM it was originally designed to analyze the properties of the Swedish student grant and loan system. It was then added to for studies of the properties of the pension system and finally further expanded for a study of the consequences of population ageing. In this gradual expansion of the model more and more submodels have been added to SESIM, such that it today can respond to more questions than its first version could. Is there any limit to the possibilities to add new structures and refine old ones? With unlimited time and resources, perhaps not, but in practice neither time nor resources are unlimited. In policy applications time might be the binding constraint, because policy makers have to take decisions and they need the output from a simulation in time for the decision, while in scientific work resources might be the binding constraint. But the key issue is what properties a model must have to answer a particular policy question. If it is possible to get an intelligent answer from a small model, why use a large and complex one?",

Another important idea is that the model should include the policy instruments that the policy makers actually use, for instance the true eligibility rules for tax deductions and all the details of the tax scales rather than just an average tax rate. SESIM thus includes (almost) all the details of the Swedish personal tax system, social security system and other benefits to the household sector. The model aims at capturing both individual longitudinal trajectories and cross-sectional distributions. Usually, it is of interest to study both the snap-shot of poverty a cross-sectional distribution gives and to understand for how long people stay in poverty. To accomplish this we need both a demographic model that can age and renew the population and dynamic behavioral models which tell us when people take their decisions.",

One reason for this is that the tax system operates on an annual basis. There are, however, processes which run on a shorter time span. For instance, sickness benefits are given by the day and unemployment compensation by month and day. In these cases we simulate the number of days (months) with benefits within a year, but not when in a year the spells of sickness or unemployment take place. Mostly for practical reasons the model and the simulations have a hierarchical structure. We try to simulate in an order such that decisions which have immediate far-reaching consequences come first in the simulation sequence. This does not necessarily imply that individuals take decisions in this order. In principle one can think of joint decisions, and to some extent it might be possible to model some decisions as joint decisions, but it is hardly practical (or even realistic) to model all decisions in a year as joint. How the model is specified in this respect does not only have implications for the simulations but also for the estimation of the submodels. Models of joint decisions will in general have to be estimated jointly, while models which form a block recursive structure can be estimated recursively.",

There are models for labor force participation, unemployment and retirement, but no model that simulates the number of hours worked, and the only model which has economic incentives built into it is the model for old age retirement. We have run experiments with decreased marginal income tax rates, but the effect of such changes on labor supply and retirement is unrealistically small. SESIM would thus become more useful if it could simulate the annual number of hours worked as a function of the budget set each individual faces. However, the labor supply model cannot be a conventional model of Hausman type. Such a model would give too much mobility in hours worked. We need a model which conditions each individual\u2019s decision on current and possibly past work hours.",

It is thus important to understand how health as young and middle-aged influences the health status when people reach a high age, and how changes in health influence the age specific death risks. We would also like to understand better how changes in the economic incentives to work longer will influence the health status of the elderly.",

SESIM is a model for the household sector, and it does not include any balancing market mechanism. Changes in the macro environment can be fed into the model exogenously but there is no general equilibrium mechanism built into the model. When modeling domestic migration and the demand for housing we considered introducing a price mechanism for owner occupied houses, because the model carries the current migration pattern forward, and it implies that an increasing share of the population will live in the three big cities. This should result in an upward pressure on the real estate prices in the cities, which could counteract the migration flow. Such an increase in real estate prices would also imply a continued shift in wealth from the rural areas to the big cities. For various reasons the introduction of a price mechanism for owner occupied homes was, however, deferred to the future.",

A badly specified CGE model might destroy the microsimulation results. A cautious approach to introduce market feedback is to do it in specific markets as suggested above, and gradually work in the direction of a macro model.",

Many economic models are of the \u201cceteris paribus\u201d kind, focusing only on the key phenomenon they were designed to explain, but ignoring much of the complexities that generated data. Such desktop models are not ideal instruments in microsimulation. A model built for simulation should use all the information available at the start of the simulation. As one of the objectives of SESIM is to simulate longitudinal trajectories its models must have a memory. Models which can be estimated from single cross-sections and implicitly assume that new decisions are taken every year independently of past history, will tend to exaggerate mobility. Furthermore, simulation models should be able to simulate the whole distribution of its endogenous variables, not just conditional means. This has implications both for the choice of model structure and in principle also for estimation. For instance, a nonstandard residual structure might hide heterogeneity in behavior; ie the population might consist of several subpopulations that behave differently. A possible solution is then to estimate one model for each subpopulation. An advantage with microsimulation is that heterogeneity of this kind is relatively easy to build into the model.",

All these uses have good motivations. Calibration can for instance be a good way to impose alternative exogenous assumptions on the model. But calibration can also be misused if it forces the model into a track it had (almost) never gone into without calibration. Calibration can be viewed as a form of constrained estimation. If the constraints are rejected by the model, enforcing them will in general lead to biased simulations.",
