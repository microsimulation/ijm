The first of these is a splicing approach \u2013 closely related to imputation \u2013 that involves stitching together individuals observed at different ages. The second is a microsimulation approach that uses panel data to estimate transition probabilities between different states at adjacent ages and then simulates a large number of individuals with different initial values. Our aim throughout is to construct life-cycle profiles of employment, earnings and family circumstances that are representative of UK individuals born between 1945 and 1954. On balance, we find the microsimulation approach is to be preferred because it allows us to correct for observable differences across cohorts, and it is more amenable to counterfactual modelling.",

For example, it makes a big difference whether wage returns to a given education policy last for just one year or persist throughout life. Likewise, it is important to know whether a health-related advertising campaign affects consumption choices in the long run as well as the short run. One area where a life-cycle perspective is particularly pertinent is the tax and benefit system. Snapshot measures of the impact of taxes and benefits obscure the fact that much of the diversity across individuals simply reflects individuals\u2019 stage in life, and ignore the fact that individuals can transfer resources across time through saving and borrowing. Moreover, some of the most interesting questions about the tax and benefit system explicitly relate to the life-cycle: what proportion benefits received by individuals are effectively self-financed by taxes paid at other times in life? How much insurance do taxes and benefits provide? How should the tax and benefit system optimally vary with age and circumstances?",

In some countries, notably in Scandinavia, increasing availability of long time series of administrative records is beginning to make this possible for a small number of cohorts. But in many countries such data are not readily available. This has led researchers in several countries to attempt to construct data on full life-cycles based on short panels and cross-sectional data (e.g. <a href=\"#bib4\">Bovenberg, Hansen, &amp; Sorensen, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Congressional Budget Office, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Falkingham &amp; Hills, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Waaijers &amp; Lever, 2013</a>). So far two basic approaches have been employed. The first of these is a splicing approach \u2013 closely related to imputation \u2013 that involves stitching together individuals observed at different ages. The second is a microsimulation approach that uses panel data to estimate transition probabilities between different states at adjacent ages and then simulates a large number of individuals with different initial values. However, as far as we are aware, little work has been done to compare the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches. In this paper we implement and discuss these two alternatives using of a short panel dataset supplemented by cross-sectional information from another survey. Our own aim throughout is to construct life-cycles that are representative of UK individuals born between 1945 and 1954 (which we label the \u2018baby-boom\u2019 cohort), an important group who have now begun to retire.",

Booster samples were introduced for Scotland and Wales in 1999. In each wave, the survey aimed to interview all individuals aged 16+ in each household, including children who reach adulthood after the survey began and adults who moved into households that were previously surveyed.

For example, there is no guarantee that partner age or child ages will be consistent between donor and recipient. However, once the splicing procedure is complete we make these variables consistent for our constructed life-cycles. The age of a given child is made consistent by subtracting the parent\u2019s age when that child first appears in the household from the parent\u2019s current age (any children leaving the household, permanently or temporarily, are assumed to be the oldest children). We match according to whether or not the individual\u2019s partner\u2019s age is over 60, and by taking the age at which this first occurs, we can also make a consistent partner age using the simple formula",

Actual incomes of donors and recipients (uprated with average income growth) are then used to give a life-cycle income profile. This approach is unlikely to be appropriate for us as we are attempting to reconstruct earnings profiles for a particular cohort. Cohort differences in earnings may mean that actual incomes of donors are not representative of what recipients experienced. Donors are also likely to have experienced a different set of economy-wide shocks (such as booms and recessions) to recipients. Instead we match on earnings <i>ranks</i> (measured as numbers between 0 and 1). By doing this we can ignore differences in cohort and period effects, and instead assume that transitions between different parts of the earnings distribution within cohorts are stable over time. We can then \u201cfill in\u201d actual earnings/rents from the cross-sectional earnings distribution observed in successive years of the LCFS for the cohort of individuals born in 1945\u201354. This ensures that the distribution of earnings and rents for our spliced individuals at each age will automatically match real-world cross-sectional distributions (in terms of mean, variance and other features). As we only observe this cohort in the LCFS from 1968 until 2012, we project earnings forward beyond 2012 by uprating the distribution for the last age each cohort is observed with forecasts for average earnings growth taken for the Office for Budget Responsibility up to age 75 (after age 75 we impose that all individuals are retired). Some cohorts reach 16 prior to 1968 leaving us with a few ages when their earnings distributions are not observed. To obtain earnings distributions for these cohorts, we take the distributions at the appropriate ages from later cohorts and downrate them with average earnings growth.",

First we determine whether or not the agent lives or dies in the period. We then randomly assign births to individuals according to probabilities of child arrival that we have estimated, and determine whether children between ages 16 and 18 leave the household. Individuals in our simulation then partner or separate. Childbirth is determined prior to partnering so that it will depend on lagged rather than current partner status (thus allowing for a nine month gestation period). We then determine whether or not individuals receive Incapacity benefit (IB), Disability Living Allowance (DLA) or both, before assigning an employment status, and a location in the earnings distribution (we impose that all those who are disabled are unemployed). Finally we determine whether or not the individual is a renter and the household\u2019s council tax band, before incrementing individuals\u2019 ages and repeating the process. The order imposed here represents assumptions about the way in which outcomes are determined. For example, since child arrival and departure are determined before partnering and separation, the number of children an individual has this period can affect his probability of being in a couple this period, but not vice-versa. (The number of children last period can affect the probability of being in a couple this period).",

The problem is that we do not have panel data that covers all the years of that cohort. Instead, we have to make use of data from later cohorts when estimating transitions at younger ages in the BHPS and earlier cohorts when estimating transitions at older ages. Differences across cohorts may mean that these individuals do not provide a realistic representation of what happened to baby-boomers. For example individuals from later cohorts may be less likely to partner, may have fewer children and may have them later. However we do observe the evolution of these variables in a succession of cross-sections from the LCFS. This can be used to adjust estimates of transition probabilities based on the BHPS such that the transitions are consistent with the aggregate levels of the baby-boom cohort observed in the LCFS.

An alternative approach is to model movements within the earnings distribution of the cohort (i.e. earnings ranks). As with the splicing approach this would assume no cohort or period differences in the nature of transitions, but the exercise in <a href=\"#s3\">Section 3.3</a> suggests that this assumption may not be too unreasonable (and in any case we would need to make a similar assumption if modelling residual transitions).

However, only 514 (26%) complete fully from age 16 until an individual\u2019s verifiable death. This is because matches for individuals cannot always be found in some circumstances (with particular difficulties at older ages when attrition from the BHPS sample for reasons other than death may be greater). At each join point there are an average of just over 35 potential matches, and on average our synthetic life-cycles are composed of 8.48 different individuals. The standard approach to dealing with data where there is non-random attrition or non-response is to weight observations according to their sampling probabilities as calculated from more representative data (such as population censuses or administrative sources). In a cross-sectional dataset these can be based on characteristics observed in a particular survey year (such as current income, race, sex etc.). To ensure that our spliced individuals provide representative results however, weights would need to be applied to each complete life-cycle. These weights would need to depend not only on the probabilities of having observed each individual in our initial sample, but also the probability of successive splicing producing a complete life-cycle.

When matches are not perfect, there is likely to be a slight discontinuity in outcomes at join points, which will give rise to a lower autocorrelation than that observed when no join is made. <a href=\"#table5\">Tables 5</a>\u2013<a href=\"#table8\">8</a> compare the two sets of autocorrelations for different five-year age groups. Despite matching across many different dimensions, autocorrelations at match points are not too dissimilar from autocorrelations observed in the data. Our matching procedure is less effective at capturing autocorrelations for the ranks of the rent distribution and for ranks of the earnings distribution and hours for over 65 year olds (due to the fact that fewer earners are available for matches in these years).",

Nonetheless, the match between the simulated individuals and cross-sectional averages in the data is excellent for all variables and both sexes. A difference in employment rates between the simulations and the data for younger ages is due to the fact that we impose that all those who have not completed full-time education are unemployed. A similar difference in the proportion of parents who are single in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> is due to the fact that, for years when cohorts are unobserved, we set the marriage rate for under 18s to be zero.",

For other variables, the profiles of our spliced individuals are however a little different those from the baby-boom cohort, reflecting cohort differences between the baby-boomers and individuals we observe in the BHPS. For instance, our spliced individuals are much more likely to be single parents at younger ages (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) reflecting the increase in lone parenthood over recent decades. Female employment rates also tend to be higher for our spliced individuals at younger ages and lower at older ages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Male employment rates are however captured quite well (except at younger ages when our spliced individuals are more likely to still be in education than the baby boomers). <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> perhaps best illustrates some of the problems that can be created by cohort differences between individuals in the BHPS and the baby-boomers. It shows the proportion of individuals renting at different ages. It is apparent that individuals in the baby-boom cohort were far more likely to rent than our spliced individuals at younger ages. This likely reflects changes in the pattern of tenure in the UK, in particular the so-called \u201cright-to-buy\u201d reforms introduced in the 1980 Housing Act which gave those who had been renting social housing for at least 3 years the right to purchase their homes at a substantial discount. The effect of the policy was to dramatically reduce the number of social renters and increase home ownership from 59% in 1983 to 69% in 2003 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chandler &amp; Disney, 2014</a>). This explains why those from later cohorts who comprise the donors to our spliced individuals at younger ages tend to be much more likely to own than the baby-boomers were at the same ages. The difficulty of capturing such cohort differences in the splicing approach tends in our view to favour microsimulation.",

But since we intend to use our spliced individuals for distributional analysis of lifetime outcomes it is also important that the persistence of these variables match those of the data. Unfortunately we are not able to compare autocorrelations of our spliced and simulated individuals directly with individuals from the baby-boom cohort throughout the whole life-cycle, because we do not have access to a panel dataset covering the whole of the adult life-cycle for the baby boomers. Instead, we plot autocorrelations for our spliced individuals against those individuals seen in the BHPS. These are intended to show whether the transitions we obtain are plausible but cannot be used to see whether they are representative of the baby-boomers. <a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig11\">11</a> plot autocorrelations for 1 year ahead, 5 years ahead and 10 years ahead for males and females from ages 16\u201365 for employment status, earnings ranks, couple status, and parent status.<sup><a href=\"#fn8\">8</a></sup>",

For example <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> shows that for our simulated individuals, ranks in the earnings distribution are less persistent at middle ages for longer horizons than earnings ranks in the BHPS, and a little more persistent at older ages. The difference is a little larger for males than for females. Employment, couple, and parent status have similar persistence in our simulations to the data \u2013 even over 10 a year horizon.

Both approaches have strengths and weaknesses. The imputation literature provides helpful analogies when it comes to comparing the two methods. In this field, researchers often have a choice of imputing missing data using real-world data from similar individuals (a \u201chot-deck\u201d imputation) or predicting it using a parametric approach estimated on the rest of the sample. The splicing approach has obvious similarities with the former method, while the microsimulation approach is closer to the latter. When is one approach to be preferred over the other? (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andridge &amp; Little, 2010</a>) compare these two approaches in a review of hot deck procedures, concluding from the available literature that \u201cthe relative performance of the methods depends on the validity of the parametric model and the sample size.\u201d The hot deck approach is less vulnerable to model misspecification than the predicted outcome approach, but when the sample size is small, and the pool of potential matches diminishes, good matches can be difficult to find. Small sample sizes (or, for the same reasons, there being a large number of outcomes that need to be matched on) would therefore seem to favour the microsimulation approach. In a similar way, the splicing approach avoids the parametric assumptions of the microsimulation approach but matches may become less appropriate in smaller datasets where the pool of potential donors is smaller.",

While it is potentially sensitive to model misspecification, the assumptions it makes on transitions are slightly weaker than those of the splicing approach. In addition, it has the advantage that we can apply corrections to ensure that average outcomes are more similar to those experienced by the baby-boom cohort. Finally, the microsimulation approach is more amenable to simulating counterfactual outcomes (for instance, different future outcomes for the same individual).",
