Policy changes are often considered in terms of their effects on a number of \u201chypothetical families\u201d. For example, in Ireland, analysis of the annual Budget often looks at specific types of people (e.g., a single person on the minimum wage, a lone parent with two children, one and two-earner couples on the average wage etc.). This approach has strong limitations as families within this category differ in terms of income, housing tenure, number of children and other characteristics that affect their tax-benefit position. More fundamentally, analysis of hypothetical families - no matter how well chosen - simply cannot give an overall picture of the impact of a policy change on incomes and work incentives at the population level. The use of tax-benefit microsimulation models, which are based on large-scale, nationally representative samples of households or rich administrative data, can provide a more representative picture of the impact of policy changes.",

This framework allows the simulation of income distributions for a given population, income structure and tax-benefit system.

However, linking these data to a microsimulation model allows the computation of counterfactual or \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios which is not possible using the underlying data alone. The ability to create counterfactual income distributions is critical to policy-makers and researchers who wish to estimate, for example, how the distribution of income will change due to population ageing (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dolls et al., 2019</a>), if unemployment increases (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dolls et al., 2012</a>) or if the parameters of the tax-benefit system change (<a href=\"#bib32\">Paulus and Tasseva, 2017</a>).

This results in a mismatch between the income reference period and policy rules/employment information. This coupled with the fact that the data underlying the EUROMOD model is not reweighted/nowcasted to match detailed employment or income control totals for the year of collection or, indeed, the current year, means that the simulated distributions of income, benefit receipt and tax revenue can be difficult to validate against external benchmarks. Additionally, EU-SILC contains aggregated rather than detailed information on benefit receipt. This makes the modelling of contributory and non-contributory benefits difficult as, without information on which particular benefit an individual is in receipt of, the researcher cannot determine this independently as social security contribution history is not available in EU-SILC. It is for these reasons that the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) develops and maintains a separate microsimulation model of the Irish tax and benefit system. The model is used internally at the ESRI and is also provided to civil servants and the staff of the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO).<a href=\"#fn1\"><sup>1</sup></a>",

Using this dataset, rather than EU-SILC allows us to use a \u201ccurrent\u201d concept for income and to model contributory and non-contributory benefits more precisely. Due to the more extensive set of variables provided in the national version of SILC, we can also model non-cash benefits, which is not possible with EUROMOD.

This sometimes means an under-representation of the lower end of the income distribution (who may not pay tax) and difficulty in simulating the effect of policies on non-taxpayers. The use of administrative data may be further complicated by national statistical agency\u2019s rules on data usage and reporting.

Simulating tax and welfare entitlements depends on factors such as the number and ages of all household members. Those not in receipt of income (such as children, inactive adults) do not appear in these administrative records and Ireland does not have a population register as exists in many other countries. Benefit entitlements often also depend on other factors. For example, couples with children whose incomes are below the relevant income limit for the in-work income support, the Working Family Payment, must work at least 38 hours per fortnight combined and hours of work information is not available in income tax data. Simulating entitlements to additional benefits such as Medical Cards (the Irish public health insurance scheme) and to subsidies under the National Childcare Scheme is also only possible based on information not recorded in administrative data, such as hours of childcare used, housing costs paid etc.",

This information is essential to accurately model income tax liabilities and entitlements to benefits.

Poverty rates calculated by CSO Ireland and Eurostat are based on annual employment and benefit income. While this makes sense in examining changes in income levels and calculating poverty rates, tax liabilities and welfare entitlements depend on current income and labour market status. For example, an individual who was unemployed at some point during the previous year and received an unemployment benefit at that time might be employed at the date of interview, with no current entitlement to unemployment benefits. Likewise an unemployed individual eligible for Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance, the means tested unemployment benefit, will be means tested based on their current income as opposed to their annual income.",

The same issue arises with pension receipt \u2013 those with sufficient lifetime PRSI contributions receive the non-means-tested State Pension (Contributory) while those without sufficient contributions receive the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory). For this reason, we also control in the input data for benefit recipients for the main benefit schemes.<a href=\"#fn17\"><sup>17</sup></a> Benefit recipient numbers are taken from administrative data \u2013 namely the DSP who report the annual recipient numbers in receipt of each benefit. We also reweight the data to match administrative data about the income distribution (specifically from Revenue\u2019s income distribution statistics which report the number of tax units in income bands) to improve the precision of tax liability simulation. As data for the 2019 income distribution were not available, we use previous income distributions (year 2015 to 2018) for employees (Schedule E income) and self-employed (Schedule D income) and constructed the forecasted income distributions for the two categories for 2019.<a href=\"#fn18\"><sup>18</sup></a>",

The first is the Working Family Payment \u2013 the in-work support for people with children on low pay. Take-up issues with this scheme have been highlighted over a number of decades and <a href=\"#bib22\">Gray and Rooney (2018)</a>, in a qualitative review of WFP recipients, indicate that take-up is still an issue. The SWITCH model therefore allows users to adjust take-up by simulating a random proportion of those eligible for the WFP to not avail of it. <a href=\"#bib28\">Keane et al. (2021)</a> estimated a non-take-up rate of 31 per cent for the means-tested public health insurance scheme, the Medical Card. The model therefore allows the user to set take-up rates for Medical and GP-Visit Cards to take account of the fact that not everyone eligible for one of these benefits actually avails of it.",

The reweighting carried out addresses this issue by ensuring that the total number of taxpayer units increases substantially (hitting the target of 2.2 million on incomes above \u20ac10,000) and that the income distribution of these taxpayer units matches those of Revenue. We do not control for numbers in the lowest income band (\u20ac0 \u2013 \u20ac10,000). Doing so would present difficulties as the weighting process is arrived at based on employment and self-employment income. Those with zero employment/self-employment income are unlikely to show up in Revenue numbers (as they have no income, therefore no tax liability). This lowest income band may also contain people receiving taxable benefits (i.e., non-employment income) income. In theory most benefits are taxable, but it is unlikely they actually incur a tax liability as an individual\u2019s tax credits will usually cover any liability. Those for whom benefits are their sole income source may therefore also not show up in Revenue numbers. It is usually only those individuals who have an alternative income source (for example rental income or occupational pensions) that will incur a tax liability on benefits received. These issues mean that the numbers in the low-income band as recorded by Revenue will differ from the actual number of low-income individuals in the population, therefore an appropriate, comparable control total does not exist for this income group. This has implications for the simulation of some means-tested benefits, as discussed later in this section.",

By design, as the reweighting method ensures that the administrative numbers used as targets/control totals are met exactly, our reweighting process results in the weighted number of recipients in the input data (column (4)) matching the administrative numbers. Examining the ratios to administrative statistics using the SWITCH output data (column (5)) again provides strong reassurance that the model is simulating benefit entitlements correctly as the ratio of recipients in the output data using the revised weight remain close to 100% for most schemes. Simulated Maternity Benefit numbers are higher than those actually reported in the input data and may reflect the fact that some people opt to have the benefit paid directly to their employer, therefore SWITCH simulates higher numbers of eligible individuals. Simulated Working Family Payment (WFP) recipient numbers are 15% higher than administrative estimates. SWITCH incorporates a take-up adjustment for WFP based on an estimated take-up rate of 33% (see <a href=\"#bib7\">Callan and Keane, 2008</a>). The gap suggests that take-up may have changed since these estimates. Simulated numbers on Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) are too low to report but this reflects the fact that some SWA recipients are individuals with little or no income who are awaiting the processing of a claim for a different social welfare benefit and may receive SWA as an emergency measure in the meantime. The SWITCH model assumes people receive benefits as soon as they are entitled to them, therefore processing delays are likely to explain this gap.",

Alternatively, in the case of Jobseekers\u2019 Allowance, for example, SWITCH may simulate the person in receipt as eligible for a different payment, such as the One-Parent Family payment (if they appear from the data to be a lone parent) or the Working Families payment (if they are only part-time unemployed).<a href=\"#fn29\"><sup>29</sup></a> Lastly, as the administrative figures we use in the reweighting process do not contain those who pay no tax, we do not reweight the lowest band of the income distribution (\u20ac0-10,000). This is likely to result in an underestimation of the number of tax-units in this income band as SILC estimates a lower population of tax units in general.

While the reweighting process used in SWITCH explains part of these discrepancies, the differences are much larger than when using SWITCH estimates and the original CSO Ireland weight. Therefore, these differences are also driven by input data and modelling issues. The use of the more detailed RMF data in the SWITCH model, as opposed to the UDB data in EUROMOD, results in significantly more precise eligibility simulation in SWITCH compared to EUROMOD. For example, the aggregation of benefits in the UDB makes it more difficult to identify precisely eligibility for benefits that use receipt in the input data to identify eligibility (i.e. part-simulated benefits). In addition, the UDB records the total amount received in benefits in the last year but not whether the benefit is currently being received. The DSP register data indicating current receipt of benefits (at a dis-aggregated level) present in the RMF thus allows SWITCH to identify exactly what benefit a person is currently receiving. The resulting part-simulated benefit recipient numbers are significantly more precise. The focus on current incomes in SWITCH, as opposed to annual incomes in EUROMOD, will also play a role in better identifying current entitlements to means-tested benefits.",

Doing so helps to highlight potential modelling errors, for example incorrect benefit payment rates in the model. It also allows us to examine if the model is representative not just of the total number of recipients of each benefit but also the distribution of people within benefits \u2013 for example if the model simulates a similar number of actual benefit recipient numbers but vastly over or underestimates the expenditure on a scheme it may suggest that the model simulates too many higher/lower rate recipients of, say, a means tested benefit. It is worth bearing in mind, however, that administrative statistics on the expenditure per scheme and SWITCH estimates may not be fully comparable due to a \u2018stock\u2019 versus \u2018flow\u2019 issue \u2013 the administrative recipient numbers show the \u2018stock\u2019 of recipients at a point in time (as at 31<sup>st</sup> of December 2019) rather than the total number of people (or \u2018flow\u2019) who received the benefit during the year. SWITCH numbers also show the \u2018stock\u2019 of people eligible for a benefit at the point of interview.<a href=\"#fn30\"><sup>30</sup></a> While this may not match exactly the people eligible as at December 31st it is significantly more comparable than comparing to the flow of all recipients throughout the year, particularly for benefits that have shorter term receipt, such as Jobseeker\u2019s or Maternity Benefit. Expenditure numbers, however, capture all expenditure on a benefit over the entire year while the SWITCH expenditure estimate is generally calculated by annualising (i.e. multiplying by 52) the weekly amount received by those unemployed and in receipt of one of these payments at the point of interview.<a href=\"#fn31\"><sup>31</sup></a> Therefore, we would expect more divergence between SWITCH and administrative values for benefits that are received for a shorter period of time or that experience large month to month changes in recipient numbers.",

The costs for Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance, Jobseeker\u2019s Benefit, Maternity Benefit and Working Family Payment are underestimated (capturing 57% to 80% of their administrative cost) \u2013 in fact the expenditure numbers using the original weight (column (2)) for these four schemes are actually closer to the administrative total. Despite this, it is still more likely the case that the SWITCH estimates using the revised weight are more accurate in capturing total expenditure at a point in time, given the fact that simulated recipient numbers on these four schemes compare well to administrative statistics, as shown in <a href=\"#table5\">Table 5</a>. Instead, seasonal variations in unemployment and the stock/flow issue described above help explain the discrepancies between SWITCH and administrative expenditure numbers on Jobseekers Allowance and Benefit as receipt of these benefits tends to be short-term so that considerable turnover on these schemes will occur. Maternity Benefit is only payable for 26 weeks; therefore it is not surprising that the administrative figure (capturing total expenditure on the scheme for all recipients during the year) is double that of SWITCH (which is calculated by multiplying the weekly simulated entitlement of those eligible for Maternity Benefit at the point of interview by the 26 week entitlement).",

Take-up of public healthcare entitlements amongst the eligible population is seldom universal in countries without universal healthcare coverage such as Ireland and the U.S. (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baicker et al., 2013</a>). This issue can help explain why SWITCH estimates may differ substantially from administrative figures as the numbers shown are based on the numbers eligible (therefore assumed to be availing of the entitlement). The SWITCH model does have the option to specify a take-up rate for these cards and therefore model random non-take-up. Non-take-up helps explain why SWITCH overestimates entitlement to GP-Visit Cards.",

Some individuals hold a card who are not currently eligible based on their means. These can be categorised into three distinct groups. First, discretionary cards (i.e. cards awarded to those above the income limit) account for around 10% of administrative numbers (see <a href=\"#bib34\">Prior et al. (2019)</a>) and these cannot be modelled by SWITCH as there is no identifiable criteria for a card on this basis.<a href=\"#fn32\"><sup>32</sup></a> Second, card holders can retain their card for three years after returning to employment after a spell of long-term unemployment. SWITCH cannot model retained cards as longitudinal information on benefit receipt is not available in the SILC data. There is no administrative information relating to how many retained cards there are in the total figure. Third, cards are issued on a three-year basis \u2013 the obligation is on cardholders to report if their means have increased since the initial granting of the card but some may not do so and still hold the card despite an increase in income. Simulation of means for the purposes of the cards may also not be exact in the SWITCH model \u2013 while the underlying data in the model contains the vast majority of information needed to calculate an individual\u2019s means for Medical and GP-Visit card purposes it does not contain information on travel to work costs which are allowed against income in the means calculation. Therefore, the model may overestimate means, and therefore underestimate the numbers entitled to the card. Robustness checks carried out which included in the model average travel to work costs for individuals did not, however, significantly impact the numbers modelled as eligible for the cards (see <a href=\"#bib28\">Keane et al., 2021</a>).",

ECCE eligibility is based on age (children must be between 2 years 8 months and 5 years, 6 months old and not in primary school) and the input data (applying the revised weight) compares favourably to administrative population statistics overall matching nearly exactly the total number of 2-5 year olds in the population. However, simulation of ECCE entitlement is also linked to reported childcare use with the subsidy only awarded to those who signal that their child in in a childcare setting for at least 15 hours a week (the pre-school entitlement). This reporting of childcare usage may be somewhat inaccurate as it is framed as \u201cusual hours\u201d per week of childcare. The ECCE scheme is only provided for 38 weeks of the year with a break over the summer months. Parents interviewed during the summer months may, therefore, report zero hours (and therefore the model will not simulate them as availing of the ECCE scheme) even if their child attends pre-school during the academic year.",

                    "text": "Regarding the NCS scheme, a number of reasons may account for the difference in the number of beneficiaries. Firstly, the NCS was only introduced in 2019, with a number of legacy schemes operating in parallel for the first year. Entitlement to these legacy schemes is complicated and not possible to simulate as the SILC data does not contain all the eligibility information needed, therefore it is not possible to identify how many people may be eligible for the NCS but remain under the old legacy scheme. The available administrative data for the first year of the scheme rollout may, therefore, not be capturing fully the number of NCS beneficiaries as people take time to transition to the new scheme. Possible take-up issues might also arise from the fact that this was the first year that the scheme was operational and thus people eligible may not have been aware of its existence or that they were eligible for a subsidy. Another possible reason could be the way that participation in the scheme is captured in SWITCH. Administrative data captures the average number of beneficiaries throughout the year, accounting for potential lower participation in the scheme during summer. In SWITCH, we assume that the weekly hours of participation (based on the reported \u2018usual\u2019 weekly hours used of formal childcare at the date of interview) are the same throughout the year, which is likely to overestimate average participation.",

As these are non-cash benefits, no monetary value is generally placed on them, so these discrepancies have no impact on the estimated (cash) income of a household and therefore any model results estimating distributional impacts, poverty and inequality rates. The main advantage of simulating eligibility for these schemes is to allow policymakers and government users of the model to estimate the impact of changes to tax-benefit rules or to parameters of these schemes, such as the means test on the numbers eligible for them. It is also likely that comparisons to administrative numbers may improve over time \u2013 for example if the take-up rates of Medical or GP-Visit cards improves and as the NCS becomes more established.",

Second, SWITCH is updated in a more timely manner than EUROMOD, in line with the Irish budgetary cycle. The more up to date nature of SWITCH is essential due to the fact that the model is provided to users across a variety of government departments and allows results from the model to feed into the annual Budget process, for example by allowing the analysis of the cost and distributional impact of tax-benefit changes to take place before the changes are actually implemented. The harmonisation of SWITCH with the European microsimulation model also presents an opportunity for researchers by facilitating cross-country research.",
