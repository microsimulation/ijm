This paper investigates the relative gains of joint taxation for married couples by comparing effective tax burdens for three groups of tax units between Germany and the UK. Using the tax and benefit microsimulation model, EUROMOD, we compare effective average income tax rates for singles, one-earner couples, and two-earner couples in Germany and the UK. Applying the concept of effective tax rates, we go beyond marginal tax rates and account for effects of tax allowances and tax exemptions. We find that effective income tax liabilities are significantly lower for the majority of tax units in Germany compared to the UK, in particular for married couples. This is because married couples are taxed jointly in Germany, whereas the spouses are taxed individually in the UK. The benefits of joint taxation are particularly important for one-earner couples, and they can be found along almost the entire income distribution.",

                    "text": "International comparisons of tax liabilities are a crucial instrument for the analysis of tax systems, since they reveal feasible alternatives for tax reforms. In the public debate, the focus is usually on the tax rates. International comparisons of personal income taxes are difficult because tax schedules are typically progressive, i.e. the average tax rates increase with income. Moreover, there are significant differences in what, and how, income is taxed, depending, for example, on whether it is earned income, capital income, or income from benefit receipt, as well as with respect to the definition of taxable income. One further dimension that is important to consider when comparing the distributional effects of income taxation is the treatment of married couples. Whereas several countries treat married spouses as two different tax units (i.e. individual taxation), other countries tax married couples as a single tax unit (i.e. joint taxation). In a progressive tax system this difference is of central importance (<a href=\"#bib23\">Steiner &amp; Wrohlich, 2004</a>, or <a href=\"#bib14\">Immervoll <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>). Germany (DE) is a prominent example for a country with joint taxation. In Germany married households jointly file their income and thus benefit from full income splitting (<i>Ehegattensplitting</i>)<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> In contrast, in the United Kingdom (UK) married couples are in principle taxed like single households.",

We have chosen the UK and Germany for several reasons. First, despite several differences in the tax and transfer system (see, e.g. <a href=\"#bib12\">Haan, Myck, 2007</a>, for a comparison of in-work tax credits in the two countries) the general progressive tax schedule is very similar in the two countries. Second the recent labor market performance in the two countries is similar, in particular female labor force participation in Germany is by now almost as high as in the UK (see <a href=\"#bib19\">OECD, 2013</a>). And finally in the European context, Germany on the one hand and the UK on the other hand belong to the leading economies, which is why this comparison is particularly relevant.",

In general these papers suggest that strict joint taxation of married households, which imposes higher marginal tax rates for the secondary earner, is not optimal. In contrast, given the higher elasticities of the secondary earner (in general the wife), <a href=\"#bib1\">Alesina <i>et al</i>. (2011)</a>, and <a href=\"#bib5\">Boskin and Sheshinski (1983)</a> show that gender based taxation with lower marginal tax rates for the secondary earner would be optimal, i.e. more efficient in terms of labor supply. The academic discussion has in fact impacted the political debate. Even in Germany several parties now propose to abandon strict joint taxation with full income splitting and to gradually switching to individual tax schedules for married partners (see <a href=\"#bib22\">SPD, 2013</a>, and <a href=\"#bib7\">B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen, 2013</a>).",

Before 2001, there was a Married Couples Allowance (MCA), under which an age-dependent tax-free allowance for the non-working spouses was granted. In 2000, this allowance was grandfathered in for couples with a spouse born before 1935, so that only these couples still benefit from the MCA today.

The tax relief compared to individual taxation is particularly great for couples with large income differences, in particular one-earner couples. It is smaller for two-earner couples, and it is zero in case both spouses have identical incomes. This system is applied in Germany for married couples (Ehegattensplitting) but not to cohabiting couples, which is why it can be labeled a marriage penalty (see <a href=\"#bib6\">Brewer <i>et al</i>., 2010</a>).",

Market incomes consist of (dependent and self-) employment income, income from capital, such as dividends, interest income, and income from renting out flats. Employment income includes all social security contributions (including employer contributions as well as imputed contributions for civil servants, and National Insurance Contributions in the case of the UK).

In Germany, most of the non-means-tested statutory benefits are financed by social security contributions, which are deductible from the income tax base.

However, precisely accounting for such differences is rather intricate, the more so as differences in benefit levels should also be considered. Importantly, our main result on the gains of joint taxation for one-earner couples relative to two-earner couples in Germany compared to the UK should not be affected by the choice of excluding SSC.

Also income-replacing benefits, such as contributory unemployment benefits, parental-leave benefits, or sickness benefits, are higher in Germany.

This also means that for about 90 percent of all taxable individuals, the effective tax liability in Germany is less than in the UK, and for the majority it is significantly lower. This stands in great contrast to the picture that evolves from the simple comparison of tax schedules (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), where the suggestion is that average tax liabilities are greater in Germany, across large parts of both the lower and central parts of the income distribution.
