                "text": "Persistent and very high-income inequality is a well-known feature of the Brazilian economy. However, from 2001 to 2014, the Gini index registered an unprecedented fall of 13.5% percent, combined with significant poverty reduction. Previous studies using partial equilibrium analysis have pointed out the important role of federal government transfer programs in this inequality reduction, particularly in the first period (2001\u20132005) when the new trend started. The aim of this research is to evaluate the efficiency of the two most important cash transfer programs, \u201c<i>Bolsa Fam\u00edlia</i> (<i>PBF</i>)\u201d and \u201cBenef\u00edcio de Presta\u00e7\u00e3o Continuada (<i>BPC</i>)\u201d, in achieving their purpose of alleviating poverty and reducing inequality in Brazil\u2019s income distribution. The simulation results, using an integrated modeling approach, confirm the importance of these programs in reducing inequality from 2003 to 2005. However, the effect on poverty alleviation was not strong. Finally, the methodological approach reveals some important mechanisms that were not present in previous analyses, such as the role of the tax structure that finances these policies.",

It is also necessary to correct the potential auto-selection bias to labor supply participation. After applying this procedure, it is possible to properly identify the different reactions of the labor supply to exogenous changes in the size of transfers for individuals in each demographic group.

In both, the positive effects on the three poorest household categories are primarily due to the increase in transfer amounts to them. On the other hand, the effects of the programs\u2019 expansion on the richest households (F7 and F8) are already negative in the first simulation (SIMU A) and are magnified when the changes in taxation were considered. There are two important causes of these negative impacts. The first is related to labor income reported in the former section. The other can be attributed to the general price increase and its effect on non-labor income such as social security benefits and interest on fixed income investments.",
