The model linkage is done using an iterative top-down bottom-up approach, ensuring the convergence of changes in disposable income, employment and wage in both models. We also incorporate the unreported wage payments in CGE and EUROMOD to account for the substantial labour tax non-compliance in Latvia and improve the modelling of the fiscal sector. Two simulations demonstrate the advantages of the joint CGE-EUROMOD system over the individual macro and microsimulation models. The lack of income distribution aspect and the scarcity of fiscal instruments in CGE can be overcome by the features of EUROMOD. The CGE model, on the other hand, provides macroeconomic spillovers that are missing in the simulations of EUROMOD.",

In this context, computable general equilibrium (CGE) models are an essential tool well-suited for analysing sectoral interdependencies and general equilibrium effects of policy changes or shocks. Such models, however, are less useful when it comes to the analysis of individual-level and distributional effects (see <a href=\"#bib15\">Cockburn et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">DeBacker et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Peichl, 2009</a>). Microsimulation models, on the other hand, are very helpful in accounting for all tax-benefit system complexities and estimating the distributional effects of policy interventions but are not well-suited for modelling their indirect effects, which can be non-negligible in case of large policy shocks (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barrios et al., 2019</a>).

Second, the models can be linked in a \"layered\" way where the linkage is performed in a specially built interface using a set of linkage variables common to both models. The linkage can work \"top-bottom\", i.e. the shock is first modelled in CGE and then transferred to the microsimulation model (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bourguignon et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bourguignon et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">H\u00e9rault, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cockburn et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Llambi et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Tiberti et al., 2018</a>), or \"bottom-up\", which involves using the output of the microsimulation model as an input in the CGE model (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bencz\u00far et al., 2018</a>), or in an iterative manner involving numerous rounds of sequential simulations and exchanges of results between the models (<a href=\"#bib40\">Savard, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Savard, 2010</a>).",

The information from EUROMOD to CGE (the bottom-up link) is transmitted through the percentage change in nominal household disposable income by income quintiles, budget revenues from labour taxes, and budget expenditures on benefits. The top-down link is implemented via two channels. The first channel transmits changes in labour market participation rate and percentage changes in employment, disaggregated by NACE industries and three skill categories. The second channel works through percentage changes in gross wages by industries and skills, changes in prices, and changes in the share of unreported wages by industries. To translate macro-level changes in employment and wages into the microsimulation model, we follow a regression-based approach similar to <a href=\"#bib30\">Marx et al. (2012)</a> and estimate probabilities to be employed, unemployed, or out of the labour force for each adult individual, and estimate the expected wage for new hires.",

In this paper, we link EUROMOD with a CGE model, while several other recent papers (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barrios et al., 2019</a>; and <a href=\"#bib5\">Barrios et al., 2020</a>) link EUROMOD with dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. Using a CGE model limits our ability to analyse the dynamic adjustment to a shock, e.g. due to the absence of price and wage rigidity, but allows for a detailed industry-level analysis. Computationally less demanding CGE models have another advantage of making it feasible to run several rounds of iterations until the results of the two models become consistent.",

                    "text": "Second, an essential feature of our linked model is that it contains a block for modelling labour tax evasion. Tax evasion is a salient problem in many post-transition economies (for example, see the results in <a href=\"#bib37\">Putni\u0146\u0161 and Sauka, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gavoille and Zasova, 2021</a>; and <a href=\"#bib7\">Benkovskis and Fadejeva, 2022</a> for Latvia, <a href=\"#bib31\">Paulus, 2015</a> for Estonia, <a href=\"#bib10\">B\u00edr\u00f3 et al., 2022</a> for Hungary). It is, therefore, crucial to explicitly model the interdependence of tax evasion with the effects of policies and shocks as in <a href=\"#bib28\">Lemelin and Savard, 2022</a>. In this paper, labour tax evasion is endogenised in CGE, allowing for industry-specific responses of the prevalence of tax evasion to changes in tax rates and economic activity. In EUROMOD, unreported wages are imputed following the approach proposed by <a href=\"#bib7\">Benkovskis and Fadejeva (2022)</a>, which allows for estimating the distributional effects of policies on both reported and total income (see <a href=\"#bib4\">Barrios et al., 2017</a> for an example of modelling tax evasion in EUROMOD). A simple rule is added to EUROMOD, stating that the total gross wage cannot be lower than the reported gross wage. On top of that, changes in the extent of labour tax evasion are linked in both models.",

In particular, we simulate the shock to financial services related to the closure of a large Latvian bank (ABLV) in February 2018. This triggered many layoffs in the financial sector and caused a large drop in financial services exports and output of the sector as a whole. We use the linked CGE-EUROMOD model to show that this shock had a substantial distributional effect: since wages in the financial services sector are above the national average, the layoffs among top-earning individuals reduced income inequality.",

The direct short-run effect of such policy change is clearly positive, especially for lower income households that enjoy a larger proportional increase in income thanks to this reform. The indirect effect, which is driven by increased consumption, demand and employment is harder to predict. The linked model allows us to simulate both the short-run (direct) and longer-run (indirect) effects: we show that the increase in demand leads to employment growth, which is more pronounced in lower deciles of income distribution, reinforcing the initial progressive effect of the reform.",

Shocks to the CGE model induce responses of all macroeconomic variables (including labour market indicators such as economic status and wage rate, see Section 3.2). Transmitting the changes in industry and skill level employment and wages to the person-level EUROMOD database is a crucial step of the algorithm. Section 3.3 describes the regressions used in assessing the probability of changes in economic status and the expected wage at individual level. Section 3.4 explains how the results of the above-mentioned regressions are used to adjust the EUROMOD database. Changes in the economic status and wage of individuals alter the distribution of income, aggregate disposable income, tax payments, and fiscal benefits. Thus, the initial exogenous shocks to the CGE model are adjusted to match the new output of EUROMOD, and the process continues until both models converge.

The first scenario is a sectoral shock to the finance industry in the CGE model. The second scenario simulates an increase in child-related benefits in EUROMOD, while the third - imposing a progressive effect of minimum wage change (see Section 4). One thing to notice is that larger shocks tend to require more iterations. Also, despite the convergence process stopping at some level (thus representing the case of non-convergence in the mathematical sense), the deviations between the two models always stabilise at economically negligible level (0.01 percentage point or less) and do not diverge, thus the consistency between the two models is achieved. In general, most of the simulations require about five iteration rounds to converge, which is feasible in terms of computing time.",

The CGE model, on the other hand, provides macroeconomic spillovers that are missing in the simulations of EUROMOD. The newly created joint CGE-EUROMOD system is an extremely rich policy simulation tool analysing a wide spectrum of macroeconomic, industry-specific, fiscal or income distribution shocks.",

Second, the simulation of tax or benefit adjustments now also accounts for changes in the macroeconomic environment, providing more adequate understanding of the overall effect. In addition to the usual advantages of the CGE and EUROMOD models, our system includes the endogenised informal wage section, which allows more realistic modelling of policy measures related to the fiscal sector.",

Only few studies investigate comparable fiscal multipliers. <a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Eyd and Barrell (2005)</a> use NiGEM model and report the fiscal multiplier for transfers in the range of 0.2-0.6 for various European countries, while <a href=\"#bib17\">Coronado et al.
