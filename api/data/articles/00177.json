The paper focus attention on two methodologies for modelling labour supply: (i) the discrete choice model and (ii) the random utility \u2013 random opportunities model. The paper then describes approaches to utilising these models for policy simulation in terms of producing and interpreting simulation outcomes, outlining an extensive literature of policy analyses utilising these approaches. Labour supply models are not only central for analysing behavioural labour supply responses but also for identifying optimal tax-benefit systems, given some of the challenges of the theoretical approach. Combining labour supply results with individual and social welfare functions enables the social evaluation of policy simulations. combining welfare functions and labour supply functions, the paper discusses how to model socially optimal income taxation.",

The crucial advantage of this approach is that the solution of the utility maximization problem is expressed in terms of comparisons of absolute values of utility rather than in terms of marginal variations of utility as in the traditional constrained utility maximization models. The RUM approach is very convenient when compared to the previous ones, since it does not require going through complicated Kuhn-Tucker conditions involving derivatives of the utility function and of the budget constraints. Therefore, it is not affected by the complexity of the rule that defines the budget set or by how many goods are contained in the utility function. Equally important, the deterministic part of the utility function can be specified in a very flexible way without worrying about the computational problems.<sup><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup> The most popular version adopts the \u201cExtreme Value\u201d distribution for the stochastic component, which leads to an easy and intuitive expression for the probability that any particular alternative is chosen (that is the multinomial or conditional logit model).",

Early and path-breaking contributions include <a href=\"#bib103\">Zabalza <i>et al</i>. (1980)</a>, where labour supply is represented in terms of probabilities of choosing among alternative hours of work or alternative jobs. This contribution, however, is essentially an ordinal probit analysis. Especially in view of modelling simultaneous decisions on the part of household partners, the Conditional Multinomial Logit model appears much more convenient. This is the line chosen by <a href=\"#bib99\">Van Soest (1995)</a>. Although this very influential contribution can be classified as belonging to the RUM family, we denote it more specifically as a Discrete Choice (DC) model, because: (i) the discreteness of the opportunity set is a distinctive feature of it (this is not the case in general for RUM models); (ii) the random term that generates the probabilistic choices is given an eclectic interpretation that includes both the RUM-McFadden (<a href=\"#bib80\">McFadden, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">1984</a>) interpretation and the optimization error interpretation (the latter leading to a non-random utility model).

The household chooses among T+1 alternatives or <i>h</i> = 0, 1, \u2026, T. The utility is first defined as non-stochastic, \u03bd(<i>f</i> (<i>wh,I</i>),<i>h</i>), where <i>w</i> is the fixed (individual-specific) gross wage rate, <i>I</i> is the exogenous income and <i>f</i>(.,.) is the tax-transfer rule that transforms gross incomes into net available income. In order to model the observed hours of work as the result of a probabilistic process, a random variable \u03b5 is added to the previously defined utility function: \u03bd(<i>f</i> (<i>wh,I</i>),<i>h</i>) + <i>\u03b5</i>. As mentioned above, the random term is typically given two different interpretations (for instance <a href=\"#bib99\">Van Soest, 1995</a>): (i) the utility contribution of unobserved characteristics of the alternative choices; (ii) a measurement/optimization error. Interpretation (i) is compatible with the classic RUM interpretation and implies that the household are observed as choosing exactly what they prefer, and what they prefer is decided on the basis of \u03bd(<i>f</i> (<i>wh,I</i>),<i>h</i>) + <i>\u03b5</i>. Interpretation (ii) instead implies that the household\u2019s preferences are measured by \u03bd(<i>f</i> (<i>wh,I</i>),<i>h</i>) but the alternative to which they are matched does not maximize \u03bd(<i>f</i> (<i>wh,I</i>),<i>h</i>) but rather \u03bd(<i>f</i> (<i>wh,I</i>),<i>h</i>) + <i>\u03b5</i> : this might happen because they make errors or because some other unexpected process displaces them from the preferred choices. However, the two interpretations in principle have very different implications in view of the simulation and of the welfare evaluation. The contributions adopting the DC approach stress the importance of a very flexible specification of \u03bd(<i>f</i> (<i>wh,I</i>),<i>h</i>) and of checking for its quasiconcavity (for instance <a href=\"#bib99\">Van Soest, 1995</a>). This focus of attention suggests that this approach indeed tends to consider \u03bd(<i>f</i> (<i>wh,I</i>),<i>h</i>) as the true utility function and \u03b5 as a measurement/optimization error.<sup><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup> Consistently, preference heterogeneity is preferably introduced through random preference parameters.",

DC models typically assume the opportunity set is fixed and imputed to every household.

An individual is assumed to be involuntary unemployed if the set of available market opportunities is empty, or contains \u201ctoo few\u201d elements, or elements with \u201ctwo poor\u201d characteristics (for instance low wage rates, bad non-pecuniary features, etc.).

A second interpretation sees involuntary unemployment as an unanticipated displacement from the chosen alternative. The most natural way to implement this interpretation would be to complement the basic labour supply model with an exogenous latent index equation (see for instance <a href=\"#bib74\">Blundell <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>).

As to the way of modelling the process that leads to the collective decision, there are two main lines of research: (i) the \u201csharing rule\u201d approach (see for instance <a href=\"#bib23\">Bloemen, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">chiappori, 1988</a>).

For example, <a href=\"#bib79\">McElroy and Horney (1981)</a> have proposed Nash bargaining.

The argument sounds attractive since an estimate of the taxable income elasticity is relatively easy to obtain and furthermore the data on taxable income might be more reliable than data upon the various dimensions of labour supply (hours, etc.). If we denote taxable income with <i>z</i> an implication is that the reference model becomes max <i>u</i>(<i>c, z</i>) s.t. <i>c</i> = <i>f</i>(<i>z</i>) rather than the standard framework max <i>u</i>(<i>c, h</i>) s.t. <i>c</i> = <i>f</i>(<i>wh, I</i>), where <i>f</i>() denotes the tax-transfer rule that transforms taxable income(s) into net available income.

Often, we observe a tendency to associate structural models with observational data and ex-post program evaluation with experimental or quasiexperimental data. Although this is what goes on in most cases, in principle nothing prevents the use of experimental or quasi-experimental data for the estimation of structural models (for instance <a href=\"#bib17\">Bargain &amp; Doorley, 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">McElroy &amp; Horney, 1981</a>). A second possible source of confusion comes from erroneously associating structural modelling with the use of \u201cconvenient\u201d parametric functional forms: although this might be a common practice, most of the research done on \u201cnon-parametric\u201d (or \u201cflexible\u201d) estimation addressed to policy evaluation is structural (for instance <a href=\"#bib24\">Blomquist &amp; Newey, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Matzkin, 2013</a>). A third erroneous perception consists of identifying structural models with models based on utility maximization. Again, while utility maximization is the \u201cmainstream\u201d, most of the \u201cagent-based\u201d approach is structural.<sup><a href=\"#fn5\">5</a></sup> What counts in view of <i>ex-ante</i> evaluation is that a set of relevant parameters (or primitives) be identified as policy independent. Depending on the class of policies we are interested in different sets or combinations of parameters might be sufficient for the purpose (<a href=\"#bib77\">Marschak, 1953</a>). Of course, the point is that data, <i>by themselves</i>, whether experimental or quasi-experimental or non-experimental, are not sufficient to identify policy-invariant parameters. Therefore, the answer to question (i) is negative: <i>ex-ante</i> evaluation requires a structural model, whether parametric or non-parametric, based on utility maximization or not, explicit or implicit, estimated on observational or (quasi-) experimental data, etc.<sup><a href=\"#fn6\">6</a></sup> Let us turn to question (ii). The structural econometric community tends now to see models as approximations. ordinary statistical testing is informative on the precision of the parameter estimates of the model but less so on how useful the estimated model is. This pragmatic approach would seem to entail a shift of focus from the issue of identification to the issues of external validation and out-of-sample prediction (<a href=\"#bib66\">Keane, 2010</a>). The amount of out-of-sample testing so far is limited (for instance <a href=\"#bib2\">Aaberge <i>et al</i>., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Aaberge &amp; Flood, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Keane &amp; Moffitt, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Keane &amp; Wolpin, 2002a</a>, <a href=\"#bib69\">2002b</a>) but reassuring.

Even in the long-run, non-behavioural results might be informative enough, provided the reforms can be represented as marginal changes in the budget constraint. The interpretation of behavioural microsimulation results raises more controversial issues. The typical policy simulation exercise computes the labour supply effects while leaving the wage rates unchanged. Some authors (see for instance <a href=\"#bib39\">Creedy &amp; Duncan, 2005</a>) interpret this scenario as the \u201cmonth after\u201d prediction, with households making new choices but the market mechanisms is still late in the process of adjusting wage rates, labour demand, etc. In our view, however, the appropriate approach with static behavioural microsimulation models is comparative statics, that is, we want to compare two different equilibria induced by two different policies. With the notion of equilibrium, we refer in general to a scenario in which the economic agents make optimal choices (that is, they choose the best alternative among those available in the opportunity set) and their choices are mutually consistent or feasible. <a href=\"#bib39\">Creedy and Duncan (2005)</a> and <a href=\"#bib89\">Peichl &amp; Siegloch (2012)</a> have proposed procedures where Dc labour supply models (as defined in <a href=\"#s2\">Section 2</a>) are complemented by a function of labour demand and the wage rates are adjusted so that the market attains the equilibrium. With RuRo models a different procedure must be used, since their specification already includes a representation of the labour demand side (that is the density of available market jobs). Since a reform in general will induce a change in labour supply, it follows that in equilibrium also the number of available jobs will have to change. <a href=\"#bib35\">Colombino (2013)</a> proposes and exemplifies an iterative simulation procedure that exploits the structural interpretation of the coefficients of the alternative-specific constants given in Equation of <a href=\"#s2-2\">Section 2.2</a>.",

The comparability of the elasticities found in the literature has, however, been questioned due to differences in data and choice of modelling framework. To account for the effect of data and methodological differences, <a href=\"#bib18\">Bargain, Orsini, and Peichl (2014)</a> assessed labour supply elasticities for 17 EU countries and the US on the basis of harmonized data covering a restricted period (1998\u20132005) and by using the same version of the random utility model (RUM) as previously has been used by <a href=\"#bib99\">Van Soest (1995)</a> for instance. Although the RUM, as discussed above, suffers from certain shortcomings as compared to the RURO the use of a unified framework will nevertheless improve the cross-country comparability of the derived labour supply elasticities. The results provided by <a href=\"#bib18\">Bargain <i>et al</i>. (2014)</a> suggest that the large variation in previously published elasticities is mainly due to differences in modelling framework and different observation periods of the data. Thus, one might question whether the sharp decline in labour supply elasticities in Europe and the US is due to differences in measurement method and methodological framework? A crucial change in methodological approach took, as indicated above, place in the mid-90s when the approach introduced by <a href=\"#bib56\">Hausman (1979)</a> was replaced by various versions of the random utility model. By using elasticities derived from these two modelling frameworks, <a href=\"#bib19\">Bargain and Peichl (2016)</a> suggest that elasticities actually have declined since the 1980s.

While in earlier years a wage increase led to a significant increase in overall labour supply, it will now lead to almost no change in labour supply. This trend is as expected and mostly due to an increase in education and a formidable real wage growth over the past 35 years. A significantly larger proportion of married women was employed in 2011 than in 1979, which means that the potential for further increase in employment has significantly decreased. Greater degree of equality in education among women and men and generous parental leave plans have also contributed to the fact that the fathers have taken parental leave from work and become more involved in the service production at home, which might have contributed to more equal labour supply behaviour for females and males over time.

(2016)</a> found for 2011 that individuals with low income and few hours worked responded more strongly to a wage increase than those with high income and many hours worked. This is largely because low income individuals have a greater potential to increase their labour supply, but it also relates to the fact that low income individuals generally have the least attractive jobs in terms of hourly wage and job content. Therefore, economic stimulation will have a stronger effect on offered jobs for people with low incomes than for high income people. This relationship has been found based on Norwegian data for all years that is 1979, 1986, 1994, 2006 and 2011. A similar relationship is also found for two sets of data for Sweden (<a href=\"#bib11\">Aaberge &amp; Flood, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Aaberge, Colombino, &amp; Strom, 2000</a>) and two datasets for Italy (<a href=\"#bib6\">Aaberge <i>et al</i>., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Aaberge, Colombino, &amp; Str\u00f8m, 2004</a>).",

This must be seen in the context that many women from immigrant groups are not in work or work for a few hours and therefore have great potential for increasing employment, while most women from the rest of the population work full-time or long part-time. Thus, since observed participation in the labour market is significantly lower among immigrant groups than among ethnic Norwegians they have a larger potential for increasing labour supply. By decomposing the overall elasticities by participation and hours elasticities, hours responses for married/cohabitants were found to be more affected by changes in hourly wages than the decision to work, some of which belong to the non-immigrant population. For immigrants, the picture is more complex, and the results vary with immigrant background. However, regardless of immigrant background, the pattern of the elasticities is like those for ethnic Norwegians and show to be relatively high for the lowest income deciles, and then they fall significantly with the income size. This is also consistent with results in studies based on data from the 70s, 80s and 90s. While the high-paid previously had small positive wage elasticities, they have negative wage elasticities in 2006 and 2011. Income elasticities for all immigrant groups except those from Western Europe, North America, and oceania are higher than for the rest of the population and are run by both participation and working time decisions.",

This policy introduces a disincentive to work, especially so for people with a low wage rate, together with further problems: high administration costs, \u201cwelfare stigma\u201d effects and take-up costs leading to low take-up rates, incentives to underreporting of income, errors in applying eligibility criteria and litigation costs (see for instance <a href=\"#bib15\">Atkinson, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Friedman, 1962</a>). Also as a response to these problems, the so-called Negative Income Tax (NIT) was proposed by <a href=\"#bib51\">Friedman (1962)</a> and supported by many economists.<sup><a href=\"#fn9\">9</a></sup> Since the second half of the 70s, in many countries, various reforms of the income-support policies have taken still a different path: work-fare programs, less generous transfers, policies targeted towards smaller segments of the population, a more sophisticated design of eligibility conditions and of the timing of transfers, in-work benefits or tax credits in order to strengthen the incentives to work (<a href=\"#bib84\">Moffitt, 2003</a>). The design of the various tax credit systems varies along many dimensions, where the Swedish and the US versions have represented the extremities. As opposed to the US system the 2007 Swedish system was universal and not phased out and thus reduced taxes for all working individuals at all earnings levels. By contrast, since the EITC (earned income tax credit) system in the US is phased out at a moderate earnings level and targeted to low-income families, redistributive concerns appear to be a major justification for its design. Evaluations of phase-out and non-phaseout versions of the tax credit system have been carried out by <a href=\"#bib22\">Bhuller <i>et al</i>. (2016)</a> and <a href=\"#bib11\">Aaberge and Flood (2013)</a> based on Norwegian and Swedish data. As expected, the phase-out versions generate lower labour supply responses, lower budget deficit and larger decrease in income inequality compared to the non-phased-out systems. More recently, in many countries a new interest is emerging for a still different reform direction: less conditioning and simpler designs closer to the original <a href=\"#bib51\">Friedman (1962)</a> proposal of the NIT, with Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) as a limit case with no means-testing (for instance <a href=\"#bib15\">Atkinson, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Van Parijs, 1995</a>).<sup><a href=\"#fn10\">10</a></sup> Also the so-called Flat-Tax (FT) \u2014as the NIT or the UBI\u2014 is an idea pointing towards simplification and is often associated with NIT-like mechanisms (see for instance <a href=\"#bib14\">Atkinson, 1996</a>). The likely effects on labour supply of these policies are an important issue for their evaluation. The FT has been analysed with behavioural microsimulation models (for instance by <a href=\"#bib6\">Aaberge <i>et al</i>., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Fuest, Peichl, &amp; Schaefer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Paulus &amp; Peichl, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Peichl, 2014</a>) provides a recent survey. UBI and other members of the NIT class have also been analysed with different results (see for instance <a href=\"#bib6\">Aaberge <i>et al</i>., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Clavet, Duclos, &amp; Lacroix, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Colombino, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Colombino &amp; Narazani, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Horstschraer, Clauss, &amp; Schnabel, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Islam &amp; Colombino, 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Jessen, Rostam-Afschar, &amp; Steiner, 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Scutella, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Sommer, 2016</a>). <a href=\"#bib61\">Islam and Colombino (2018)</a> examine in various European countries the case for an optimal tax-transfer rule in the class NIT+FT, assuming all incomes are treated according to the same rule. They find that the current system is always dominated (social welfare wise) by at least one member of the class NIT+FT. Labour supply effects are small but not irrelevant. In most cases UBI is preferred to CBI, the latter inducing more \u201cwelfare dependence\". It might be the case that the important effects would come from changes in administration costs; most likely a reduction when adopting policies with simpler designs. So far, however, structural models and microsimulation procedures have not been able to account for the implications of administration costs. A gap which is to be filled in future work.",

As indicated above, several recent contributions identify optimal tax-benefit rules by employing random utility models of labour supply together with microsimulation and, some version of, the social evaluation framework presented in <a href=\"#s5-5\">Section 5.5</a> below. <a href=\"#bib4\">Aaberge and Colombino (2013)</a> identify optimal income tax regimes in Norway within a 10-parameter family of piecewise linear systems based on rank-dependent social welfare functions with different inequality aversion profiles. A similar exercise for Italy, where the adopted social welfare criteria account for inequality-of-opportunity, has been considered by <a href=\"#bib3\">Aaberge and Colombino (2012)</a>. <a href=\"#bib27\">Blundell and Shephard (2012)</a> have designed an optimal tax-benefit rule for low-income families with children in the UK. <a href=\"#bib37\">Colombino and Narazani (2013)</a> and <a href=\"#bib36\">Colombino (2015)</a> have focussed on alternative basic income-support in Italy. <a href=\"#bib61\">Islam and Colombino (2018)</a> have identified optimal tax-transfer rules in the NIT+FT class for a sample of European countries. As opposed to the theory-based optimal tax exercises, the micro-econometric simulation approach allows for a much more flexible representation of households' preferences and choice opportunities and permits analysis of more complicated tax-benefit rules. This has significant implications upon the results. For example, <a href=\"#bib4\">Aaberge and Colombino (2013)</a>, for each of four different social welfare functions with inequality aversion profiles that range from neutrality to strong downside inequality aversion, identify the tax system that maximizes social welfare within a class of 10 parameter tax rules. The results show that the marginal tax rates of each of the optimal tax systems turned out to be monotonically increasing with income and that more egalitarian social welfare functions tended to imply more progressive tax rules. Moreover, the optimal bottom marginal tax rate is negative, suggesting a mechanism close to policies like the Working Families Tax Credit in the UK, the Earned Income Tax Credit in the USA and the In-Work Tax Credit in Sweden. The overall emerging picture is somehow close to <a href=\"#bib92\">Saez (2002)</a> and <a href=\"#bib45\">Diamond and Saez (2011)</a> but is in sharp contrast with most of the results obtained by the numerical exercises based on <a href=\"#bib83\">Mirrlees (1971)</a> or <a href=\"#bib91\">Saez (2001)</a>. The typical outcomes of the latter exercises envisage a positive lump-sum transfer which is progressively taxed away by very high marginal tax rates on lower incomes, in combination with a proportional or slightly increasing tax rate on higher incomes. <a href=\"#bib61\">Islam and Colombino (2018)</a> show a large heterogeneity of results across different countries and \u2014within the NIT\u2014FT class\u2014 find that most of the optimal rules present a concave NIT profile, that is, the phasing-out marginal rate applied to subsidised incomes is lower than the (flat) tax rate applied to higher incomes. overall, the results obtained with the microsimulation approach seems to support what suggested by Tuomala (2010): the theory-based results might be enforced by the restrictive assumptions made on the preferences, the elasticities and the distribution of productivities (or wage rates), which in turn might conflict with the empirical evidence provided by microeconomic labour supply studies.",

It is straightforward to provide a summary of changes in employments rates and distributions of hours of work and income. However, a social planner needs information that makes it possible to compare individuals\u2019 level of welfare before and after a policy change and thus who is gaining and who is losing on the policy change. It is, however, not obvious how one should make a social evaluation of the policy effects when the individuals\u2019 welfare is a function of income and leisure. The estimated utility functions, or their systematic parts, might emerge as a useful basis for making social evaluations of welfare. However, since the behaviour of an individual is invariant with respect to monotonic transformations of the utility function, we face two problems. The first one concerns the construction of specific cardinal utility functions to represent the consumption/leisure preferences of individuals/households, and the second concerns the lack of convincing justification for comparing arbitrarily chosen individual cardinal utility functions and use them as arguments in a social welfare function (see for instance the thorough discussion provided by <a href=\"#bib55\">Hammond, 1991</a>). The origin of the problem is as stated by Hume that one cannot derive an \u201cought\u201d from an \u201cis\u201d. The common practice of basing social evaluations on distributions of individual-specific money metric measures of utility differences like equivalent and compensating variation disregards the interpersonal comparability problem, which makes it difficult to judge the ethical significance of this approach. To circumvent these problems, <a href=\"#bib42\">Deaton and Muellbauer (1980)</a> and <a href=\"#bib55\">Hammond (1991)</a> propose to use a common utility function as a tool for making interpersonal comparisons of welfare, since it by definition contains interpersonal comparability of both welfare levels and welfare differences. The common utility function is supposed to capture the preferences of the social planner, whereas the individual/household- specific utility functions solely are assumed to capture the consumption/leisure preferences of individuals/households. The latter can be used to simulate the behaviour of individuals/households under alternative tax/benefit systems, whereas the former is designed to be used for evaluating the outcomes of simulation exercises. As argued by <a href=\"#bib4\">Aaberge and Colombino (2013)</a> a plausible approach is to assume that the social planner exploits the information provided by the consumption/leisure choices of the individuals/households (and moreover accounts for large heterogeneity in the availability of different jobs in the market) by estimating the common utility function. Below we will provide an explanation of the specific version of the common utility approach employed by <a href=\"#bib4\">Aaberge and Colombino (2013)</a> for designing optimal taxes based on a microeconomic model of labour supply. Since households differ regarding size and composition, it is required to construct a common utility function that justifies comparisons of individual welfare for individuals. The common utility function, individual welfare function, <i>V</i> is to be interpreted just as the input of a social welfare function and thus differs from the role played by the actual utility function <i>U</i> for households. The individual welfare function (<i>V</i>) is assumed to have a functional form that is identical to the basic functional form of the systematic part of the positive utility function <i>U</i>, which means that the heterogeneity of the parameters of <i>U</i> has been removed. Thus, <i>V</i> is defined by (<a href=\"#equ17\">Equation 21</a>)",

The events took a different route. On the one hand, the first successful implementations of microsimulation models at the policy level were nonbehavioural. On the other hand, the researchers working on microeconometric models of labour supply started using microsimulation tools for policy design and evaluation. In this paper, we have illustrated the current labour supply modelling strategies and their possible evolutions, together with their policy applications that use microsimulation methods. Further developments, both on the microsimulation algorithms side and on the microeconometric side, might or might not favour a development of a stronger link between large microsimulation algorithms and behavioural labour supply analysis. The general problem is that there is a trade-off between the increasing theoretical sophistication of labour supply models (that is, stochastic dynamic programming models, intrahousehold allocation or collective models, etc.) and their flexibility in interacting with other models representing different segments of the economic system. However, the approach currently adopted in most of the labour supply modelling literature, that is the RUM/RURO approach, at the moment represents an excellent compromise between increasing sophistication and tractability/interactions within larger simulation projects. Addressing more complex tax-transfer policies, adding other dimension of choice (besides hours of work) or introducing dynamics and intertemporal choices, do not change the basic logical and computational structure of RUM/RURO models. Their typical discrete representation of the opportunity sets is naturally matched to the logic of discrete states and discrete choices prevailing in microsimulation since its origins. Furthermore, microsimulation provides an ideal platform for addressing issues that are hard, if not impossible, to tackle analytically, that is identifying optimal tax-transfer policies, comparing alternative theory of choice (for instance utility maximization vs. agent-based models) or exploring the implications of alternative social welfare evaluation criteria.",
