Using Senegal as a case study, we illustrate the results of integrating the growth and productivity gain effects of trade liberalization with the resulting long-run impacts on welfare and poverty. We show that the distributional impacts between poor and non-poor depend upon the specific nature of the trade liberalization policies adopted; and the characteristics of the economy in which it occurs. In the Senegalese case, the predicted principal beneficiaries of trade liberalization are urban and higher skill workers.",

The import-substitution and export-subsidy policies adopted after independence were slowly removed from 1980 onwards in the context of various structural adjustment programs in the hope of encouraging more efficient resource allocation. While increased trade might benefit Senegal as a whole, there is a growing concern about its distributional impacts between poor and non-poor. Although the assessment of the impacts of trade liberalization on the Senegalese economy and population has received some interest in the literature<a href=\"#fn4\"><sup>4</sup></a>, none of the previous analysis has focused on the distributional impacts of trade liberalization policies in the presence of productivity gains.",

                    "text": "Using a sequential dynamic CGE model of Senegal<a href=\"#fn5\"><sup>5</sup></a> we simulated a complete unilateral elimination of tariffs. The study uses the 2004 Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) that includes 35 industries (six primary, 19 industrial and 10 in services), eight productive factors, and one representative household. Gender (male and female), geographical (urban and rural), and skill (educated and uneducated) dimensions are used to break down labour into six categories. As imports become cheaper, their demand increases and demand for competing domestic production falls. In the face of a foreign savings (or current account balance) constraint, increased imports must be matched by increased exports through a depreciation of the real exchange rate. Sectoral impacts thus differ depending on whether a sector competes with imports or whether its production is oriented towards the export market. Hence, the initial structure of the national economy is of great importance. In our model, the productivity of each sector is a function of its openness to trade, which we capture by introducing an empirically-estimated trade-productivity elasticity (<a href=\"#bib11\">Martens, 2007</a>). Results of this simulation suggest that the productivity channel substantially boosts growth and generally accentuates the sectoral impacts. <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a> shows that the industrial sectors faced the highest initial tariffs and accounted for the majority of total exports and imports. However, services account for close to 60 percent of value-added and an important part, mainly tourism, is export-oriented.",
