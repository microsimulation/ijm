The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and attributes of the microsimulation model NCDMod, an Australian, purpose-built model that simulates multiple chronic diseases and associated risk factors. The model offers flexibility in perspective and population of interest. The model projects out to 2025 in 5-year increments using a combination of static and dynamic methods. Transition equations are sourced from the literature and in-house analysis. NCDMod is able to capture the impacts of population ageing and shifts in incidence of specific chronic diseases and risk factors. Results from NCDMod will help to fill gaps in current Australian evidence on the population level impacts of interventions to prevent/delay chronic health conditions particularly diabetes, heart disease and obesity. Further, in combination with Health&WealthMod2030 this model will be able to offer evidence regarding the potential impact of health interventions on the long-term costs (both from an individual and government perspective) of ill health leading to unplanned retirement. In the consideration of disease interventions, the additional workers who may be able to continue to work due to delayed/prevented chronic disease can be modelled.",

There is a strong association between chronic disease, morbidity and mortality. The rate and absolute numbers of people with chronic diseases have been increasing providing health policy challenges especially related to expenditure on health care. Some 85 per cent of total burden of disease (BoD) was non-communicable (largely chronic) diseases in the Australasia region in 2010 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2014a</a>). In 2011\u201312, 4.6% of Australians aged 2 years and over (999,000 people) had diagnosed diabetes (excluding gestational diabetes)(<a href=\"#bib7\">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2013a</a>), about 0.6% of persons had type 1 diabetes with the remaining 3.9% having type 2 diabetes. The age-standardised proportion of the Australian population with diabetes has increased across the 10 years between 2001 and 2011\u201312 from 3.4% to 4.4%. In 2011\u201312, 5.0% of Australians aged 2 years and over (1.1 million people) had heart disease, which included ischaemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease, oedema, heart failure, and diseases of the arteries, arterioles and capillaries (<a href=\"#bib7\">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2013a</a>). Between 2001 and 2011\u201312 there was a shift in the age-standardised rates of heart, stroke and vascular disease from 4.4% to 4.7%. For Australian males in 2003, the two leading causes of disease burden was ischaemic heart disease with 151,107 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) at 11.1% of BoD followed by type 2 diabetes with 71,176 DALYs at 5.2% of BoD. For Australian women, IHD (112,390 DALYs at 8.9%) and type 2 diabetes (61,763 DALYs at 4.9%) were ranked second and fourth respectively (<a href=\"#bib16\">Begg <i>et al</i>., 2007</a>).",

In 2008\u201309, it was reported that $AU7,605 million was spent on cardiovascular disease (CVD), approximately 12% of all health care expenditure in Australia. This was the largest single spend on a disease group (<a href=\"#bib12\">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2014b</a>). Similarly, diabetes is associated with considerable medical expenditure \u2013 in 2005 it was estimated that in 2010 $AU6.1 billion was spent on persons with known type 2 diabetes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee <i>et al</i>., 2013</a>). Diabetes is associated with sizable economic impacts to both individuals and government in terms of lost income, decreased taxation revenue, increased government support payments and reduced savings at age 65 due to premature exit from the labour force because of diabetes. Those with diabetes have immediate limitation of income available, as well as reduced long-term financial capacity due to reduced accumulated savings and the income these savings could generate in retirement (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schofield <i>et al</i>., 2015</a>).

As well, there are strong links between these chronic diseases and obesity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2015a</a>). Considerable health burden is related to obesity both directly and via co-morbidities such as diabetes and CVD. In turn, this has large impacts on health expenditure and more widely on productivity. A systematic review which compared obese individuals with normal weight persons reported significant associations between obesity and all cancers, all CVDs, type 2 diabetes, asthma, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, and chronic back pain (<a href=\"#bib29\">Guh <i>et al</i>., 2009</a>). The strength of association was strongest for type 2 diabetes with incidence rate ratios of 6.74 (95% confidence intervals: 5.55, 8.19) for men and 12.41 (95% confidence intervals: 9.03, 17.06) for women.

Microsimulation modelling takes a bottom up simulation approach by modelling at the individual level. It then allows aggregation to consider population and sub-population level outcomes.",

The UK (United Kingdom) Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) outcomes model versions 1 and 2 offer simulation modelling (probabilistic discrete\u2013time) to forecast occurrence of diabetes related complications and death. The model calculates the BoD over a population\u2019s lifetime based on life expectancy, quality adjusted life years, complication rates and costs for each member of the population. The probability equations are based on the UKPDS (<a href=\"#bib22\">Clarke <i>et al</i>., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hayes, Leal, Gray, Holman, &amp; Clarke, 2013</a>). HealthAgeingMod, a disease specific model was developed for the Australian context, using a model-system framework that could track individual risk factors over time, model the incidence of heart disease, stroke and diabetes, estimate treatment costs and scale these impacts to an Australian level to estimate cost-benefits of policy reform. It was used to assess the impacts of population ageing and decreased obesity rates (Walker , Butler, &amp; Colagiuri, 2013). From the UK, FORESIGHT is a model that has been used to simulate projected implications of various BMI (body mass index) reductions on 13 diseases and their future health costs (<a href=\"#bib37\">McPherson, Marsh, Rtveladze, Webber, &amp; Brown, 2012</a>). POHEM-CVD is a dynamic microsimulation model developed to reflect the individual\u2019s lifecourse projecting their CVD related risk factors. It creates a synthetic population and ages each individual one at a time through to their death. It allows projection of disease incidence, prevalence, life expectancy, health adjusted life expectancy and quality of life (<a href=\"#bib35\">Manuel <i>et al</i>., 2014</a>). This model is part of the broader POHEM modelling program which allows consideration of multiple diseases. Some microsimulation models have taken a broader view of chronic disease within the socio-economic context. However, these models often define health in a broader manner such as presence of disability, see for example MOSART (<a href=\"#bib27\">Fredriksen, 1998</a>), CAPP_DYN (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mazzaferro &amp; Morciano, 2008</a>), INAHSIM-II (<a href=\"#bib28\">Fukawa, 2012</a>) and/or a health status index as seen in INAHSIM-II (<a href=\"#bib28\">Fukawa, 2012</a>) and SESIM LEV 2012 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Brouwers <i>et al</i>., 2014</a>). The main purpose for these models are projections of social security expenditure (pre-dominantly disability and aged pensions) though some do consider health care expenditure, for example SESIM LEV (<a href=\"#bib19\">Brouwers <i>et al</i>., 2014</a>). The predominant motivation in the development of these models is concern about the ageing population being experienced by developed countries. For example APPSIM, an Australian dynamic microsimulation model was developed to project socio-economic conditions over a 50 year period. This model included health as an index to allow projection of health care spending and disability status (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lymer, 2011</a>). It did not model specific diseases in the population and associated impacts on life expectancy or quality adjusted life years. A more inclusive, general microsimulation model, SESIM is a Swedish dynamic microsimulation model that projects from 1999 to 2050. It is based on LINDA, a database of approximately 3.5% of the Swedish population. The model assigns baseline health status (4-point index from severe illness to full health) and health care consumption. Health status and health care consumption is then projected across time. In addition, specific disease and care consumption across time was separately modelled for diabetes, stroke, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cancer (<a href=\"#bib19\">Brouwers <i>et al</i>., 2014</a>). In 2013, the redevelopment of HealthAgeingMod into NCDMod was the revision to an upgraded microsimulation model to dynamically model specific diseases (currently focusing on type 2 diabetes and CVD), their impacts on life expectancy, quality of life and costs of health care. The chronic diseases are linked to key risk factors, such as obesity, through the transition equations. The model now commences projections from a base year of 2010 and represents the Australian population at that time point. The focus has moved to the working age population and transition from early adulthood into middle age. This model provides the means to model cost-effectiveness at a population level for randomized clinical trials not previously available in HealthAgeingMod, as well as the capacity to consider counterfactual scenarios around health policy interventions. The current model can consider population level cost-effectiveness of prevention/interventions focussed on multifactorial risk factors such as obesity as well as intervention level cost-consequences.",

NCDMod is an Australian, purpose-built model that simulates multiple diseases making use of the most current Australian data available. It utilises improved and updated transition equations from the previous modelling of HealthAgeingMod. The model offers greater flexibility in the perspectives it can consider which includes cost-effectiveness related to clinical trials, population health and policy interventions.

Changes in the demographic structure of the population (such as ageing), from 2005 to 2010 (and other modelled years to 2025) were captured through static ageing techniques. The NHS05 was weighted by the ABS to address the issue of unequal probability of individual selection in the survey, and to make the survey data a true representation of the Australian population in the survey year (<a href=\"#bib6\">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2006</a>). A survey weight designed to take into account the individual\u2019s probability of selection and the clustering and the stratification of the sample was assigned to each record in the dataset. This weight reflects the number of people with similar characteristics in the Australian population at the survey year. Starting with these sample weights, we then reweighted the NHS05 to reflect the profile of the population aged 20 years and over in 2010 and other modelled years (2015, 2020, 2025) using a generalised regression reweighting algorithm programmed in a SAS macro called GREGWT. This macro was developed by the ABS and is commonly used to reweight their survey data (<a href=\"#bib17\">Bell, 2000</a>). GREGWT uses the generalized regression method to modify initial survey weights so that the weighted totals match the externally provided totals known as benchmarks.

Performance is less satisfactory for the indicators of percentage who ever smoked, percentage with high blood pressure and percentage with CVD. With these indicators it is worth noting that whilst the percentage difference is comparatively large the absolute percentage point difference is still small. This occurs particularly in the case of CVD prevalence because of the relatively small rates of the condition at a population level. Additionally, the level of health expenditure was compared to 2013/14 AIHW data on health expenditure which indicated that approximately $AU69 billion was spent on health services (excluding research and administration) for adults aged 18 years and over.

Further chronic disease prevalence data under given scenarios can be linked to Health&amp;WealthMod 2030 to estimate (i) the number of people out of the labour force due to their ill health; and (ii) the lost income and savings of people who have left the labour force because of their ill health, compared to those who continued in paid employment (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schofield <i>et al</i>., 2014</a>).

Trends in chronic disease, co-morbidity and risk factors will also have substantial impact on need for health care and consequent health expenditure. Understanding if interventions that are shown to be effective in a clinical trial offer population level impacts if offered to the wider population and are cost-effective in the wider population setting are important in a context of fiscal sustainability.
