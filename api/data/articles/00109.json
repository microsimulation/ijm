The paper develops indicators that cover the aggregate and individual level, and use averages as well as extreme values to get a deeper understanding of the results. As for the validation of the AVID model itself, the results are mixed: the average values on the aggregate and the individual level were very similar in the projection and the empirical data, but the projection underestimated the stability of the employment histories.",

Developments of mother tongue and home language in Canada are projected in order to investigate the impact of immigration on changes in levels and linguistic composition Projection results show that the population of non-official mother tongues will increase rapidly while the increase in home language is less important due to language shifts. The ratio of English speakers to French speakers would therefore increase both in Qu\u00e9bec and in the rest of Canada.",

The central thesis of this paper is that models with dynamic and static ageing might under theoretical circumstances be more equivalent in terms of simulation properties than their technical differences suggest. The choice between the two archetypes of models thus comes down to assessing how far the actual and theoretical circumstances differ from each other. This short note thus hopes to contribute to the debate in choosing between these two types of models.",
