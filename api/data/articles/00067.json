However, the access to a long historical panel is usually restricted for many reasons. This paper aims to develop a back simulation method that has the potential to generate a consistent synthetic history panel based on a typical household survey dataset with some complementary statistics. The model uses Living in Ireland (LU) household survey as an example to reconstruct the individual labour market trajectory since 1939. The overall results of the simulated panel have been proven sensible and consistent based on several validation tests. This method opens the possibility to further investigate into several fields of application such as life-cycle income analysis and pension reform evaluation, which typically requires the historical profile of individuals and has traditionally been difficult to perform.",

Dynamic microsimulation models in theory, could offer more insights than static models as they usually integrate long-term projections and behaviour simulations; however, they are costly to develop and require a baseline dataset that is both rich in variables and historical information.

However, the time period in these survey datasets may be insufficient to provide certain historical information required for life-cycle modelling and analysis. Administrative data, although typically consisting of a more limited range of contextual variables, often provides a longer history and contains relatively high quality information for certain variables, e.g. tax, and in most cases, a higher number of observations.

For example, a microsimulation model based on a household survey dataset may need some historical earning records that are only available from another income study dataset. Under such a circumstance, a matching method may be used to fill in the information gaps based on a statistical model using available social economic characteristics shared by both datasets. The DYNASIM model was one of the pioneers in this area and uses Current Population Survey (CPS) as the base dataset matched with social security earnings records from administrative data. In DYNASIM3 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Favreault, 2004</a>), the statistical matching was undertaken between two survey datasets, namely, Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), while PENSIM2 matches Family Resource Survey (FRS) and British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to the Lifelong Labour Market Database (LLMDB) to incorporate household contextual data (<a href=\"#bib8\">Emmerson <i>et al</i>., 2004</a>).

The DYNANCAN model uses a limited back simulation technique by imputing the historical earning profiles between 1966 and 1969 with limited retrospective consistency (<a href=\"#bib18\">Morrison, 1997</a>;<a href=\"#bib19\">1998</a>), whilst the CORSIM model simulates part of the historical profile based on a historical crosssectional dataset, matching the model output to historical aggregate information such as fertility and mortality rates (<a href=\"#bib2\">Caldwell, 1997</a>). Nevertheless, the existing methods only impute the history for a limited number of years and they usually suffer from the inconsistency issues. While certain variables match the historical data at cross-sectional level, the longitudinal consistencies are typically ignored and variables covered are not extensive enough to support life cycle analyses and pension simulations.",

In some cases, certain variables, e.g. historical earning records, may not exist in any dataset or access is restricted due to legal restrictions.

One drawback of this simplification is that it raises the bar for alignment, as the simulated data will not be able to compare with the historical aggregate indicators.

While a back simulation model may use some historical information to refine the outcome, it also has a higher requirement on the output quality. Since the main purpose of this back simulation model is to recreate each individual career trajectory, it demands a high accuracy of the model prediction as the pension eligibility is highly sensitive to the past employment status. In a forward microsimulation model, one would typically use some kind of aggregated values (e.g. mean, standard deviation of the distribution) to evaluate the quality of the simulation. The predicted value does not need to be correct at the individual level as long as the distributions are reasonable. Nonetheless, in the case of backward simulation, one needs to ensure that the values are sensible at the individual level due to the longitudinal consistency requirement while maintaining the reasonable distribution shape at each crosssectional level.",

Self-employed jobs were not deemed eligible until 1988. Given this information, it is possible to influence the pension entitlement by modifying two factors within a career profile: the years of contribution and the density of contribution. For example, if an individual is not eligible for a state pension but the simulation gives an opposite result (a type I error), it is most likely that the model over-simulated the number of years worked with a pension eligible job, or that the starting year is too late. In this case, it is possible to improve the consistency by removing the years of working experience in eligible jobs and replace them with non-eligible activities. Meanwhile, a reverse correction procedure can be applied to type II error individuals (the ones with pension eligibility but without simulated eligibility).",

For instance, if the labour force participation is lower than the census value for a specific simulated year, then the model will not be allowed to remove employment statuses from that particular year, instead, it will put a higher priority on employment creation for that particular year. Since the LII is a panel dataset, the simulated history should be consistent with not only the first year, but with all the waves. Therefore, this alignment procedure takes several iterations; the model first aligns the history with the last wave in the survey, and then gradually moves to the first wave in a loop.

However, the lack of real historical data is the very reason that the back simulation is required. In addition, it is not feasible to compare the model with other back simulation approaches, e.g. statistical matching method, in this particular case, as synthetic history recreation is the only option due to the data limitation. Therefore, the results of the model are mainly compared with the known benchmarks: the census reports and the pension eligibilities.

As shown, the longitudinal inconsistency in the simulation is well controlled; in total, over 83% of the individuals were simulated with an error no greater than 1 year, and over 89% of the observations have a difference of less than 2 years. A few extreme cases are also spotted with an error greater than 10 years. These observations typically report no working history but with old age pension entitlement. In this case, the model overrides the report of zero working year in favour of the observed pension eligibilities. On average, the absolute simulation errors for males are slightly larger than those for females. A possible reason is that males generally have longer career trajectories, which increase the computation complexity in balancing the crosssectional and longitudinal alignments. The longer career trajectory also implies that the measurement error of the retrospective values like reported years of work might be bigger for males. As a result, the quality of the simulation could be negatively affected due to the inconsistent reported values.",

From the graphs it can be seen that the self-employment rates increase dramatically for males above the age of 35 over time and this stabilises around 30%, while the self-employment rate for males under 35 is just above 12% most of the time. The raise slope of the curve in the earlier part of the history may be contributed to by the limited number of observations for the age group. For females, the self-employment ratio is more or less stable within each age group except for a moderate decline for workers over 50 years old. Despite the drop, this late-career age group has a self-employment rate of around 30%, which is more than 20 percentage points higher compared with other groups. The differences are mainly due to the dropped female labour participation at later ages. Since the average age of retirement for female employee is lower than the male counterparts, the proportion of the self-employed workers increases after age 50. The graphs demonstrate that workers under the age of 35 have the least preference towards self-employment, a preference which is observed in both the simulated histories and the original dataset.",

Due to the nature of historical simulation, the longitudinal consistency requirement is high and difficult to achieve when compared with a forward dynamic microsimulation. The method proposed in this paper solves this problem by introducing extra calibrations and alignments at both the crosssectional and longitudinal levels. The overall result of the simulated panel, as described in the earlier sections, matches the labour market history to a fairly high degree based on the macro statistics calculated. The simulated values follow the observed trend quite closely, and are able to pick up the dynamics of different types of pension eligibility across time and cohorts. Nevertheless, further validation of the long-term trajectories of the employment and earnings produced by the model might be necessary, although there is little reliable data to compare the results with for the earlier half of 20th century.",

(2006)</a> and <a href=\"#bib26\">Zaidi and Scott (2001)</a>. The generated historical panel could consequently enhance the accuracy and stability of the forward dynamic simulation by feeding in information on career trajectory. Given the extensive retrospective information modelled, the back simulated panel has a much higher data quality than a simple synthetic panel. Since only standardized survey questions and macro statistics are used in the simulation, this proposed back simulation method could be potentially replicated in other datasets that include retrospective questions, e.g. ECHP, BHPS, German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), FFS. The method could help modellers to run a life-cycle based simulation without using a scarce long panel. In addition, the historical panel provides many important insights, e.g. the dynamics of career trajectories, which would otherwise be easily overlooked in the original dataset.",
