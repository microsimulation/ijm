It is designed for comparable simulations and analyses across countries as well as for policy swaps and EU level analysis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Sutherland, 2014</a>). It has evolved and expanded since it was first initiated in 1996 and much of this development has been related to the need to accommodate the policies and data and to address the relevant research and policy questions in a consistent way; not only over time but also across a growing number of EU countries. The modelling platform as a whole (described further below) is designed to be both flexible and transparent as well as generic (not country-specific) but at the same time to provide a clear framework for the incorporation of new countries. It is also made freely available. Since it is unique in many of these respects EUROMOD was the obvious choice of modelling platform for the SOUTHMOD project. In addition, the recent successful incorporation of Croatia (which joined the EU in 2013) as well as the development of non-EU models using the EUROMOD platform (e.g. for Russia and Serbia) demonstrated that EUROMOD was fit for purpose and, most relevantly, models for South Africa and Namibia had already been developed by adapting the EU model.<sup><a href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup>",

First of all, as in many contexts, it is undoubtedly easier to make an effective start on a new project if there is an existing structure and guidelines, even if these are questioned and amended later. Furthermore, each country starting from the same structure and guidelines meant that the end products would be more similar, even if not fully comparable, than if they had started independently from blank sheets.

The inclusion of detailed information on household expenditures in African micro-data permitted the simulation of indirect taxes in a straightforward way that is not possible in the EU.

The extent to which less-relevant aspects of the guidelines were a time-consuming distraction was something that reduced in importance as the project progressed and the team as a whole learned what was and was not a priority in the context of the countries being studied.

There was very little information available to enable external validation of the income data. The SOUTHMOD programme has an ongoing work stream to explore more sophisticated data cleaning processes for the income data, including a range of multiple imputation methods for missing and implausible data, and the use of administrative data on personal income taxes to improve the income data.

The Tanzanian paper in this edition provides an example of the intricate (and fluid) rules that exist in Tanzania for social security benefits. Regarding the acquisition of external validation data, in some instances it was simply not possible though this was never due to access being denied. It is hoped that over time such information will become more readily accessible and that research activities such as the SOUTHMOD programme will help to provide an impetus alongside larger initiatives such as the United Nations World Data Forum<sup><a href=\"#fn6\">6</a></sup> and the African Union\u2019s African Charter on Statistics which also promotes transparency and access to data.<sup><a href=\"#fn7\">7</a></sup>",

This was much more of a strength than an impediment, as it required there to be meticulous clarity of communication within each country model team, between the country model team and the country stakeholders, between the country model teams, and when converting policy rules into instructions for each country model using the EUROMOD software. As highlighted above, the EUROMOD project itself promotes harmonized terminology and naming conventions, and so EUROMOD was well suited to accommodate these realities. That having been said, all of the models were produced and annotated in English. Some of the training events were undertaken in other languages, for example partly in Swahili in Tanzania and almost exclusively in Portuguese in Mozambique. Training materials for civil servants are increasingly being produced in languages other than English in order to facilitate access to the models. Much more could be done to promote access to the models for non-English speakers within and outside the team, as well as to promote awareness of the models within the respective countries amongst stakeholders in the vernacular.",

For high income countries this is respectively 55% for indirect taxes and 35% for personal income taxes.<sup>8</sup> This illustrates two things. First, in developing countries, indirect taxes, in the form of import and export duties, excise duties and sales taxes (on intermediate and final transactions, or retail sales taxes and VAT), typically play a larger role as revenue generating instrument, than the personal income tax system. Second, during the process of development there often is a gradual move away from more distortive general sales taxes to less harmful indirect taxes such as VAT and to taxes which do take into account individual abilities to pay (such as personal income taxes).<sup><a href=\"#fn9\">9</a></sup> Monitoring the budgetary and distributional effects of this important change in the revenue structure of developing countries, made it compelling to integrate from the very beginning of the project indirect tax analysis into the models. The SOUTHMOD models for Ethiopia, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia, Ghana and Ecuador each have a VAT policy, plus an Excise Duty policy for tobacco, alcohol, and fuel. The South Africa and Namibia country models have VAT policies, but no excise.",

Contrary to the available income surveys or administrative datasets underlying the EU-countries in EUROMOD, which in most cases do not contain detailed expenditures, most of the countries of the SOUTHMOD project did use surveys that provide detailed information on expenditures, and even quantities, for a detailed break-down of total expenditures. This allowed the incorporation of retail sales tax or VAT and the most important excise duties in a rather straightforward way. Since no behavioural model was linked with the personal income tax module, we have chosen to postpone also the integration of behavioural reactions such as income or relative price effects into the consumer allocation model. Changes in consumer prices, triggered by a change in either VAT or an excise duty, are affecting after-tax disposable income by calculating the change in indirect taxes to be paid at unchanged quantities. But it is well-known that even this impact effect is an acceptable first order approximation of the true welfare effect of price changes (see <a href=\"#bib3\">Cap\u00e9au, Decoster, &amp; Phillips, 2014</a>).",

The underreporting of some expenditure categories when compared to national account aggregates is in itself a well-known issue in richer countries but is mostly fixed by ad hoc adjustments for revenue predictions. Of course, this underreporting changes nature and becomes more relevant from a welfare point of view when it reflects purchases in the informal sector. The quick fix, consisting of uprating expenditures and/or revenues to calibrate the simulated revenue in the baseline with some external indirect tax total, obviously becomes less attractive for two reasons. First, by definition no taxes are paid in the informal sector. And second, the margin of behaviour of shifting from formal to informal sector will matter.<sup><a href=\"#fn10\">10</a></sup> This caveat holds a fortiori for the distributional effects when the underreporting and/or reliance on purchases in the informal sector is more prevalent in expenditure categories which are relatively important for the poor.",

The latter might be particularly relevant in developing countries, since it is probable that many traders have a turnover below the applicable registration threshold for VAT. In that case, the increased production costs due to un-reclaimable VAT charged on inputs to production might be reflected in the final price paid by the consumer.<sup><a href=\"#fn11\">11</a></sup> There exist methods to estimate these effects of the VAT on the prices of exempt goods, and incorporate these implicit tax rates into microsimulation models (see <a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmad &amp; Stern, 1984</a>, for a seminal; and Du, 2015 for a recent illustration using input-output tables). However, in line with standard practice of most microsimulation models, at this stage we have only included indirect taxes paid directly by consumers and do not take account of the indirect effects of non-reclaimable VAT or of excises paid at earlier stages of production.

While some countries for which SOUTHMOD models exist have a functioning old-age pension programme, others have pension coverage only for workers in the public sector, in addition to some voluntary contributed schemes. The paper simulates different common pension reforms for Ecuador, Ghana, South Africa, and Tanzania. The policies modelled differ in terms of their generosity and the threshold age (above 60 or 70 years). For countries that already run an existing pension system, the new systems are assumed to either replace or complement the systems already in place. The results suggest that the impact of the pension systems on reducing poverty among the target group is potentially considerable, for instance reducing poverty headcount by 33% in the case of Tanzania. But the costs can also be large, requiring a major increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio or the GDP. The paper demonstrates the similarities and differences that arise in different countries when modelling these kinds of policies.",

The results suggest that the simulated values better predict the actual total sums of taxes and transfers, based on external information.

In the budget-neutral reform, the benefit expansion is financed by an increase in social security contributions. In addition to static simulation results, the authors also take into account potential behavioural changes due to the increase in the tax burden. For this end, they incorporate estimation results regarding the change in the share of formal sector work when the tax burden on formal-sector work is increased. The results suggest that the desirable effects of the reform remain valid, even when taking into account the behavioural reactions.",
