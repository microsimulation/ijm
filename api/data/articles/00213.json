In this paper, we provide a novel way to account for these trends, extending <a href=\"#bib31\">Michelangeli and Pietrunti (2014)</a> microsimulation model of households\u2019 financial vulnerability. The extension provides a more accurate assessment of the financial stability risks stemming from the household sector. The growth in consumer credit drives an increase in the share of vulnerable households, but with small effects on the overall debt at risk. Mortgage renegotiations contribute to a decrease in households\u2019 vulnerability.",

A first indicator that has been greatly employed by central banks to assess households\u2019 ability to meet their debt obligations is the debt service-to-income ratio (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bank of Canada, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bank of England, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bank of Italy, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">European Central Bank, 2004</a>, among others). Some studies have been carried out to assess how debt delinquency varies for different threshold values (<a href=\"#bib30\">May and Tudela, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Tiongson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dey et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Beer and Schurz, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Karasulu, 2008</a>). <a href=\"#bib36\">Vacca et al. (2013)</a> confirmed that the risk of arrears increases at a 30 per cent threshold and for households whose income net of debt payments is below the relative poverty line. A second indicator that has been used to identify financial vulnerable households is the financial margin, defined as the net income available to households after debt payments and basic living expenses (<a href=\"#bib29\">Martin and Persson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Vatne, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Zaj\u0105czkowski and \u017bochowski, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Albacete and Fessler, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ampudia et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bettocchi et al., 2018</a>, among others). <a href=\"#bib32\">Michelangeli and Rampazzi (2016)</a> show that the shares of households classified as vulnerable according to both indicators (the first based on the debt service-to-income ratio and the second based on the financial margin) are similar. However, the first indicator is much simpler to compute and does not suffer from arbitrariness in the definition of some of its components, such as basic living costs. Following <a href=\"#bib36\">Vacca et al. (2013)</a> and <a href=\"#bib32\">Michelangeli and Rampazzi (2016)</a>, we define a household as vulnerable if its debt service-to-income ratio exceeds 30 per cent and its income is below the median of the population.",

This latter model includes the dynamics of income and mortgages (without renegotiations), while the outstanding consumer credit is assumed to be constant over time (the growth rate equals zero). These assumptions were adequate overall in the early 2010s, when mortgage renegotiations were very rare and consumer credit was growing at a relatively slow pace and up from very low levels in Italy. The recent development in household loans now means we need to accurately model the evolution over time of consumer credit and mortgage renegotiations, whose combined effect on households\u2019 vulnerability is ex-ante unknown. The growth in consumer loans may increase vulnerability because households would face a larger loan instalment; at the same time, renegotiations act in the opposite direction by reducing periodic loan repayments. Not accounting for these dynamics may lead to a bias of an unknown sign in the projection of households\u2019 vulnerability.",

This implies, for instance, that a rapid increase in consumer loans can be promptly taken into account in the microsimulation model. More in detail, the projection of consumer credit is achieved in three steps: estimation of household participation, forecast of the total amount of consumer credit and computation of the instalment paid by each household. While we use an empirical approach for the first two steps, we impose some structure on the third one, assuming a standard amortization scheme. For mortgage renegotiations, we introduce simple heuristics, according to which households revise their contract terms when they pay an interest rate that is significantly above current market rates. This becomes a share of households renegotiating their mortgage that is consistent with the evidence from the SHIW.",

In particular, adding the possibility of renegotiating the mortgage terms turns out to be crucial for reproducing the downward trend observed between 2012 and 2016. Second, the new model allows us to assess how a sustained growth in consumer credit would affect households\u2019 debt sustainability.

This strand of the literature exploits detailed microeconomic data to identify which type of households are more exposed to the risk of default. By combining microeconomic and macroeconomic data, these models provide updated measures of the risks for financial stability stemming from the household sector and may even contribute to forecasting or early warning indicators. The first papers on this topic were those of <a href=\"#bib29\">Martin and Persson (2006)</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">Vatne (2006)</a> and <a href=\"#bib38\">Zaj\u0105czkowski and \u017bochowski (2007)</a> for Sweden, Norway and Poland, respectively.

In recent years, many central banks have begun to publish data on consumer credit aggregates to show the main trends of this kind of debt and the emerging risks (<a href=\"#bib27\">Magri et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">European Central Bank, 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bank of Italy, 2018a</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">2018b</a>). Furthermore, microeconomic data from household surveys have been exploited to capture the heterogeneity in the access to consumer credit market. For instance, <a href=\"#bib26\">Magri (2002)</a> uses the SHIW to show that participation in consumer credit is positively correlated with income; a similar result is obtained by <a href=\"#bib15\">del R\u00edo and Young (2006)</a> who, by focusing on unsecured debt for the years 1995 and 2000, show that the increase in participation and in the amounts borrowed are explained by the growth in household income. <a href=\"#bib28\">Magri et al. (2011)</a> use Eurostat\u2019s EU-SILC survey for nine European countries in the period 2005\u201308 to highlight that, regardless of the broad heterogeneity in participation across countries, borrowers tend to have a medium-high income, which they believe could be associated with the preference of lenders for granting loans to safer borrowers. Several papers have provided evidence of the procyclicality of debt and tried to identify the drivers of both demand and supply (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nakajima and R\u00edos-Rull, 2014</a>). A robust finding is that durable consumption expenditures is procyclical as well as consumer debt (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bertola et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Iacoviello, 2008</a>; for a review, see <a href=\"#bib14\">Claus and Claus, 2016</a>).

Their identification implies the computation of the DSR for each household, as it is not directly contained in the survey. To this end, we exploit the information provided by the household on instalments for mortgages and for loans for needs other than property purchase or renovation. This information is not available for credit card receivables and bank overdrafts,; we thus assume that each year the whole credit card debt and one fifth of bank overdrafts are repaid. The assumption on the repayment of credit card debt is quite natural, since it is often repaid in a few months; that on bank overdrafts comes from the fact that in Italy they must be repaid upon the bank\u2019s request, but usually this type of debt is not repaid for several years. We therefore assume that a household repays the total bank overdraft in five years, which is on the one hand, a credible amount of time if we look at the dynamics of bank overdrafts within the longitudinal component of the SHIW, but on the other hand it is also a conservative choice (meaning that it tends to amplify debt-service ratios), since bank overdrafts could be repaid in more than five years.",

Households that chose to revise their mortgage terms were, on average, paying higher interest rates than other households in the previous wave; after renegotiation, the rate charged was lower. About one third of these households moved from a condition of vulnerability to one of non-vulnerability.",

In 2010, consumer loans were quite uniformly distributed across household income groups (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This implied that low-income households were proportionally bearing a much higher consumer debt than high-income ones. Instead, in 2016, the vast majority of mortgages were concentrated among households with an income above the median of the population and similarly, the share of consumer credit held by high-income households has progressively increased. This suggests that the ability of the household sector to sustain debt payments has been on the rise.",

The \u2018new model instead projects an increase in the share of vulnerable households, which is entirely driven by the high growth rate of consumer credit. In the second year of the simulation, a rise in interest rates, which affects both the loan payments of households holding a variable interest rate mortgage and those associated with new originations, and a positive credit growth (for both mortgages and consumer credit) contributed to the increase in the share of vulnerable households despite a positive income growth. The total effect is more pronounced in the \u2018new model\u2019, when consumer credit growth is also considered.

By reducing loan instalments, mortgage renegotiations contribute to decreasing vulnerability. Consumer credit instead drives an increase in the share of vulnerable households, though with small effects on the overall debt at risk. A model accounting separately for these two forces can be particularly useful, in particular at a time when they impact household financial vulnerability in opposite directions and it is not possible to establish ex-ante the overall effect. The model indicates that between 2016 and 2019, the percentage of vulnerable households increased from 1.6 to 2.3 per cent, while the share of debt at risk only changed slightly, from 10.4 to 12.0 per cent. In terms of the number of vulnerable household heads, this model generates a larger share of vulnerable households than in <a href=\"#bib31\">Michelangeli and Pietrunti (2014)</a>, which is mostly driven by the high growth rate of consumer credit. Instead, in terms of debt at risk, the differences between the two models are negligible, since the negative effects on vulnerability associated with the expansion of consumer credit are compensated by the positive effects associated with mortgage renegotiations.",

This increase affects both the payments associated with existing variable-rate loans and new loan originations. This shock is combined with a decrease of 4 percentage points in the growth rate of nominal income; the income shock affects all households. Relative to the baseline projections, the share of vulnerable households would be higher by about 0.3 percentage points and their debt by about 2.2 percentage points. The results of this simulation suggest that the conditions of Italian households would remain quite sound overall even if more hostile conditions were to occur, as vulnerability indicators would always remain below the levels reached in 2012.",
