However, this issue appears crucial in order to comprehensively evaluate the likely distributional effects of institutional reforms adopted to cope with population ageing. In this work we describe the implementation in the Italian dynamic micro simulation model CAPP_DYN of a new module in which households\u2019 savings and asset allocation are modelled. In particular, we aim to account for possible behavioural responses to pension reforms in household savings. To this end, we rely on an approximate life cycle structural framework for estimating saving behaviour, while adopting a traditional stochastic micro simulation approach for asset allocation. In line with <a href=\"#bib1\">Ando and Nicoletti Altimari (2004)</a>, we emphasize the role of lifetime economic resources in households\u2019 consumption decisions, yet we further account for internal habit formation and subjective expectations on pension outcomes in the econometric stage. In addition, we model intergenerational transfers of private wealth in a probabilistic fashion.",

However such task has been hardly tackled in this literature and just few models are endowed with a module able to account for the evolution of private wealth over time. Indeed, introducing a wealth module in a dynamic microsimulation model (DMSM) brings undoubted advantages, yet it also entails some drawbacks. On the one hand, the modelling of wealth permits researchers to draw a more complete picture of disposable income dynamics (i.e. labour and pensions plus capital income) and households\u2019 well-being distribution; in addition it allows also to analyze the future redistributive effects of reforms that will affect \u2013 as expected in Italy \u2013 both public and private pension pillars. In fact, reforms implemented in Italy from 1992 to 2007 have significantly affected the institutional social security framework, introducing a tight actuarial link between contributions paid and pension received back<sup><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup>.",

Indeed, the significant reduction in returns on social contributions and therefore in the generosity of public pension system implies current young individuals to worry about their future living standards more than their parents did so far in Italy. Thus, to achieve consumption smoothing in the future, individuals are required to rely on private resources more than it was necessary in the past and to increase their savings during the working life in order to channel it into \u201cretirement-oriented investments\u201d such as pension funds and real estate.",

Following, in <a href=\"#s2-2\">Section 2.2</a>, we describe the theoretical background for modelling households\u2019 behaviour in distributing resources for consumption over the life cycle. In order to achieve this aim, we focus on the estimation of household lifetime human resources \u2013 and their specific components (<a href=\"#s2-2-1\">Section 2.2.1</a> and <a href=\"#s2-2-2\">2.2.2</a>) \u2013 a key variable employed for the estimation of the consumption rule explained in <a href=\"#s2-3\">Section 2.3</a>, which represents one of the core processes of the dynamic simulation.

In particular, we focus on the comparison of main findings and the role of main drivers of inequality under the semi-structural life-cycle approach and a traditional framework based on a Keynesian consumption rule.

Individuals falling under the NDC pension scheme expect, on average, 3 points less in their future replacement rate but, once controlling for all other covariates, the effect does not seem to be significantly different from zero. Also in this equation, but with a clearer pattern, time dummies catch the recent (downward) revision in pension outcome expectations, while cohort dummies surprisingly show, other things being equal, that the younger the cohort the higher the expectation about future replacement rate. Once again, time, cohort and age effects are only identified by functional form in these models and causal effects are hard to be interpreted.",

In fact, looking at the recent past (<i>i.e.</i> our 1989\u20132008 panel dataset, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), we notice that the saving propensity profile of Italian households is characterized by a nearly flat pattern from about 35 years on, with pensioners having, on average, a positive propensity to save even at older ages.",

Moreover, by estimating a propensity rather than a level, in the simulation program we get rid of the necessity to make arbitrary assumptions on dynamics of aggregate consumption due to its non-stationarity in a dynamic economy. In other words, if we simulated in levels, we would need to align consumption in addition to income. On the opposite, we would like consumption to be an endogenous outcome of the model, with respect both to its variance and to the mean itself (i.e. no alignment).",

The inclusion of such characteristics in the equations (especially, the parents\u2019 financial wealth in the recipient regression) allows us to explain a quite similar share of the variance of the dependent variables in the two outcome equations (<i>i.e.</i> transfers given and received), providing predicted values characterized by similar variability.

As it can be noticed, the NS approach tends to reproduce the past average pattern, implying an anomalous flat or moderately-growing profile even after retirement, still consistent with the retirement consumption puzzle particularly marked so far in Italy (right panel). However, this peculiar evidence can be explained by the presence of a pronounced precautionary savings motive (<a href=\"#bib7\">Jappelli <i>et al</i>., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Lusardi, 1997</a>) and a low consumption propensity of elderly, which, despite the generous pension system, reflects a well-rooted habit persistence (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baldini <i>et al</i>., 2002</a>).

In fact, in the second period, the within age-group pro-inequality effects due to the intergenerational transmission of wealth, which becomes more unevenly distributed, prevails on the between-groups anti-inequality effect related to the reduction of distances between young and elderly average wealth. On the opposite, savings appears mostly inequality-increasing in the previous spell, while inequality-reducing in the latter period. In this case, the between age-group anti-inequality effect related to the spend-down of elderly (placed on average in the right tail of the wealth distribution) replaces the within group pro-inequality impact of savings capacities among active households. Capital gains effects are ambiguous over time, although a slightly higher incidence of negative contributions can be observed. This depends on the non-pure <i>iid</i> nature of overall returns due to the probabilistic model of risk propensity (<i>\u03c6</i>), which is characterized by a non-linear age profile and a non-linear relationship with total wealth.",

Since capital incomes are assumed to be a fixed proportion of the underlying stocks (a simplifying hypothesis that can be relaxed) and latter is distributed more unevenly than labour and pension incomes, an increasing share of capital income on overall disposable income implies growing inequality.

In such new scenario, private wealth becomes crucial both in determining overall wellbeing after retirement and, <i>ex ante</i>, in affecting saving/investing as well as retirement decisions. Despite its growing importance, this issue has not yet been analysed in depth, especially in its distributional implications. The present work aims to fill this gap by endowing the Italian dynamic micro simulation model CAPP_DYN with a module accounting for the role of private asset accumulation and spend down. The joint analysis of private wealth accumulation and social security wealth is particularly important in order to get a reliable evaluation of household disposable incomes and standard of living in the coming decades.",

Our main argument points at stressing the relevance of expectations about future resources in current consumption choices in a radical \u2013 but very gradual across cohorts \u2013 reform scenario. In particular, policy parameters enter into the saving decision by means of subjective expectations about pension outcomes. Since the reform is still in progress and individuals/households seem to adjust slowly their behaviour, the consumption rule we estimate and introduce in the simulation program allows the age structure of the propensity to consume current income to vary along the simulation period according to the internalization process of expectations better than a Keynesian consumption function would do. This semi-structural formulation of consumption equation, coupled with traditional probabilistic approach for other processes and heuristic rules of thumb accounting for stylized facts, allows embodying these tendencies while not neglecting the current empirical evidence and the institutional specificities.",
