In particular, it presents a prototype modelling technique which forms a component of the SimBritain modelling project. The paper first briefly discusses some of the key conceptual and practical issues involved in microsimulation, in particular highlighting the differences between <i>spatial</i> and <i>aspatial</i> microsimulation models. The paper then outlines a potential alternative to fully stochastic event-driven spatial dynamic microsimulation. This alternative uses longitudinal data to produce and project Generic Household Spaces Through Time (GHOSTs), all within a spatial modelling framework. To this end the paper first outlines how to derive GHOSTs from longitudinal data, then explains how the attributes of these GHOSTs can be projected forward in time.",

Much of the methodology underlying SimBritain is well-established. However it is important to recognise that all microsimulation models incorporate error. Even static spatial microsimulation models \u2013 those which model patterns or behaviours across space at one point in time \u2013 will not produce exact matches when tested against independent data. When these static models are made dynamic, projecting estimated variables into the future, the scope for error increases.

SimBritain uses the iterative proportional fitting method in a reweighting fashion to generate an estimated small area microdata on the basis of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and the Census of the UK population (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ballas <i>et al</i>., 2005</a>). Specifically, we use samples of households from the BHPS and record their values in each of our six dimensions of interest \u2013 region, demography, household type, economic position, housing tenure and car ownership. We then decide upon the geographic area we are interested in modelling and the spatial units for which we wish to produce estimates. We then use the Census of Population to determine, for each spatial unit, the number of households falling into each category across our six dimensions of interest. A series of iterations is next performed, area by area, dimension by dimension. At each step, the weighted contribution of each BHPS household is adjusted so that, for a given spatial unit the sum of all household weights across a given dimension matches the corresponding Census total. Once a convergent set of weights emerges \u2013 typically after a dozen or fewer iterations \u2013 we have a list of household weights for each spatial unit, the weight being the number of times that household is represented in the simulated population for that area.",

This method represents an alternative to reweighting methods that involve random number generator reweighting approaches such as simulated annealing (first applied in such a context by <a href=\"#bib30\">Williamson <i>et al</i>., 1998</a>). The method has also been used in combination with a small area population projection technique in order to estimate small area microdata for future points in time (by reweighting the survey data to the projected future dimension totals), thus adding an \u201cimplicitly dynamic\u201d dimension (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ballas <i>et al</i>., 2005a</a>).

However, two difficulties with this approach became apparent, following plausibility testing. First, the idea of allowing households to \u2018move around\u2019 SimBritain, constrained only by known and projected patterns of migration within the UK, proved impossible, primarily because of the lack of suitable migration data. A dynamic spatial microsimulation model, to work, has to incorporate migration, emigration, and immigration processes which can rapidly change the nature of small area. Second, the idea of \u2018splicing\u2019 household histories together, thereby extending for example a ten-year household record from the BHPS through to 2021, came up against fundamental difficulties of household definition, exacerbated by the effects of attrition upon panel surveys. The \u201csplicing\u201d idea was, to put it simply, to join the end (2001) of a household, in a household with similar characteristics in 1991 and use that to project forward to 2011.",

Instead of making the household our centre of attention we concentrated instead upon the household spaces within which those households live. By moving away from the idea of ageing households over time and instead concentrating upon filling notional buildings with the sorts of households that typically inhabit them, we are able to use far more of the data in the panel survey, exchanging emphasis on consistency within a household\u2019s history for plausibility in the history of the spaces which households inhabit. The following section discusses this process in some detail, developing a set of GHOSTs for Wales for the period 1991\u20132021. <a href=\"#s4\">Section 4</a> then goes on to describe how these entities can be used for projection purposes.",

A third dimension would contain whatever variables of interest are selected. When a household ceased to exist the row would cease and when a new household formed a new row would be created.

As such, the question arises whether a household remains the same unit, given that individual household members may have left, due to death or moving out.

The drawback of this approach is that, as the authors recognise, \u201cafter several years a \u2018household\u2019 might consist of totally different persons than in the first wave\u201d. However the identification of change of address as one element in a possible definition leads to a focus on the spatial dimension. Much of the literature reviewed had as its fundamental concern the dynamics of household formation and change. The perspective here is somewhat different. The concern is not so much with household processes <i>per se</i>, rather with their effects on the composition of local areas through time. If the emphasis is shifted from the household to the space in which that household lives, then a simpler approach can be adopted.",

The OSH is simply the first BHPS wave household identifier (BHPS variable <i>ahid</i>) for that OSM. When sorting out household histories the OSH is an invaluable indicator because it helps to disentangle some of the more complicated household histories (for example where members of families split off from original households only to rejoin at a later date) as well as clarifying apparent discontinuities in histories (for example where the family reference person changes between times despite no change in household composition, or where it is the result of the gain or loss of a member of another generation).",

The approach presented here is also much less computationally intensive than conventional dynamic spatial microsimulation models based on event modelling. Further, as is the case with all other components of the SimBritain project, the GHOSTs method does not rely on random number generators at any stage.
