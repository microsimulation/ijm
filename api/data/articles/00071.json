(2001)</a> to link a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to a microsimulation (MS) model. The proposed approach allows for the linking of an MS model to a dynamic (rather than static) CGE model. The approach relies on altering the sample weights in order to reproduce long-term population projections and changes in employment as estimated by the CGE model. The approach is applied to assess the effects of climate-change mitigation policies in Australia from 2005 to 2030 at five-yearly intervals.",

Only key areas of impact from climate change, for which the impacts could be measured with enough certainty to be modelled in the CGE, were included. Broadly speaking, it determined the likely market impacts of climate change on primary production (sheep and cattle, dairy, cereals), critical infrastructure (coastal settlements, water and electricity, transport), human health (heat stress, illnesses, and their effect on productivity and labour supply), and tropical cyclones (capital losses from storms). Most of these impacts were operationalised by changes in primary factor usage, capital augmenting technical change, intermediate input technical change, effective labour supply, and labour productivity. The two mitigation scenarios differ in the level with which emissions are to be reduced. It is assumed that climate change itself will not have a direct economic impact before 2030.",

In addition, it should be noted that even if the CGE model were fully consistent with Treasury+ABS projections, two steps would still be required since we need to benchmark the MS model against a large number of constraints. Given that there are limitations on the number of constraints that can be used in calibrating the new weights, two steps are also needed to accommodate all required benchmarks.

To avoid such discrepancies, benchmarks for age and gender composition at the national level are also imposed at the second stage of the reweighting. Although these constraints ensure that the MS model remains consistent with the Treasury population projections by age and gender at the national level, in practice, discrepancies can still occur at the regional level.

In policy runs, the wage rates for different industries are presumed to move proportionally, that is, the pre-existing wage differentials between industries are held constant. Wage growth itself is largely determined by labour productivity growth, which is exogenous in the CGE model and based on Treasury and ABS projections (see <a href=\"#bib15\">Commonwealth Treasury, 2008</a>). However, regional wage differentials are endogenously determined by the CGE model. Hence, the CGE model generates changes in average wages by region but not by industry (nor occupation). This has the disadvantage that there is no opportunity for skill levels to affect wage growth in the CGE model, and therefore current wage differentials between low- and high-skilled individuals are held constant in relative terms. Therefore, the information transferred to the MS model cannot account for changing wage differentials by skill level, which would otherwise have been likely to contribute to changes in income inequality. This limitation is due to the inherent lack of detail of such a large-scale modelling exercise. It also highlights how designing CGE and MS models with linking in mind could overcome this. Allowing for wage and employment changes by occupation or skill level in the CGE model, something highly desirable from the perspective of the MS model, would probably have come at the expense of richness in the CGE elsewhere.

Consequently, within each State, the current relative wage differential between two given workers is assumed to be fixed. However, changes in the wage distribution are generated by changes in employment levels by industry, since each industry has a different wage distribution. The wage distribution is also indirectly affected by the predicted changes in the population structure by age and gender, since wages vary among workers of different demographic groups. Hence, the CGE model changes are adjusted before being applied to each household in the MS model, so that the component of these changes due to changes in the population (and employment) structure is removed.

Hence, a substantial proportion of non-labour factor income appearing in the CGE model is actually not returned to households (or not returned in the year it is earned). This explains why total income and disposable income are much higher in the CGE model than in the MS model. Since non-labour factor income is more likely to be present in high-income households than in low-income households, this implies that income in higher-income households is more likely to be underestimated in the MS model as a result of this than income in low-income households.",

A second point to emphasise is that although the distributional analysis is based on unit record data for individual households, and is therefore very flexible, this flexibility cannot be fully utilised in all the analyses. For example, changes in wages are available only at a highly aggregated level in the CGE model (changes in wages only differ by region). As a result, although the full heterogeneity of the Australian population is accounted for, the same changes over time predicted by the CGE model are applied to large groups of households. So for wages, all households within the same region have the same percentage wage increase. Nevertheless, the MS model is useful in accounting for changes in the wage distribution that are driven by demographic phenomena (such as ageing) or by changes in employment levels by industry, as well as providing disaggregate results on other income received by individuals.",

As a result, since wage earners are predicted to experience real income growth due to increasing labour productivity, inequality increases over time by assumption. This tendency towards increasing inequality by design is difficult to avoid in such a long-term simulation analysis because it is largely a reflection of extrapolation of current practices in the indexation of benefit payments<sup><a href=\"#fn17\">17</a></sup>.

Australia-wide, the Gini coefficient is reduced by about 3 per cent under the 450ppm scenario and by 2 per cent under the 550ppm scenario compared to the reference case. There are two main reasons for these results. First, the introduction of the ETS generates deadweight losses that are detrimental to factor income growth. Hence, factor income growth is lower under the two mitigation scenarios than under the base scenario so that the divergence between factor income and benefit payments (fixed in real terms by assumption) is reduced, and as a result inequality is reduced. Second, the lump sum transfers taking place under the mitigation scenarios have a dampening impact on inequality since they are equally distributed on a per capita basis. Should the permit revenues be returned to households in a way that targets low-income households, then inequality may be even further reduced.",

The paper draws on previous work by <a href=\"#bib23\">Robilliard <i>et al</i>. (2001)</a> which linked a CGE model and an MS model in a sequential way. In this analysis, however, the CGE results had to be taken as given, and it is the MS model that is adapted to use all relevant inputs from the CGE model. This has brought problems and omissions in the CGE to the surface, showing that there would be gains to developing the two models simultaneously and making the CGE results more suitable for feeding into an MS model.",

The transmission of price changes as well as income changes from the CGE to the MS model remains similar to what can be found in the literature. That is, it relies on the transmission of average changes since CGE models only produce changes at the aggregate level. Our approach, based on adjusting sample weights, has two advantages. First, it allows the linking of an MS model to a dynamic, and not simply a static, CGE model. Second, it allows the MS model to reproduce the long-term demographic changes predicted by the CGE model (or any forecasting agency) to occur over time in the base population.",

In this paper, the approach is applied to assess the impacts on household income of two climate-change mitigation policies compared to a reference case without mitigation. The simulations are carried out for the period from 2005 to 2030 in Australia. The results clearly show that these two mitigation policies are likely to have positive distributional effects despite a slightly negative effect on average real income. To a large extent, this is due to the redistribution of carbon permit revenues to households on a per capita basis through lump sum transfers.",

The paper has discussed a range of important assumptions and limitations inherent to this type of modelling exercise. Ideally, the sensitivity of results to a range of assumptions should be checked before drawing any strong conclusions. A number of assumptions used in this paper were imposed by the specific CGE results used as input for the MS stage and in theory, these could be changed to be made more suitable for the distributional analysis. It is clear that the analysis could be strengthened by the simultaneous development of both models, instead of having to adapt the MS model to a given CGE model as is currently the case. For instance, the MS modelling would greatly benefit from access to aggregate results which would provide more detail on a number of key outcomes, such as for example, wage and employment changes by occupation or skill level. However, CGE modelling has its own constraints and it is not always technically feasible to generate the outcomes that are seen as crucial for MS modelling.",
