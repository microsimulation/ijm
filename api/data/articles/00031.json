                "text": "This paper studies the economic, poverty, and income inequality impacts of both world and domestic trade reform in Argentina, with a special focus on export taxes. Argentina offers an interesting case study as the only large agricultural exporter that has, at many points in its history, applied export taxes to several of its agricultural products. The paper combines results from a global economy-wide model (World Bank\u2019s LINKAGE model), a national CGE model, and microsimulations. The results suggest that full liberalization of world trade (including subsidies and import taxes, but not export taxes), both for agricultural and non-agricultural goods, reduces poverty and inequality in Argentina. However, if only agricultural goods are included, indicators for poverty and inequality do not improve and even deteriorate somewhat. This is particularly the case if export taxes are eliminated.",

The consequences of those three factors are less employment in general, through different and cumulative channels. Low labour intensity leads to declines in employment. In the case of agriculture particularly, land is shifted from livestock, industrial crops, and other products that tend to be more labour intensive, to grains and oilseeds that are less so. This negative employment effect at the primary level is reinforced by the fact that, since the commodities from these sectors are inputs into other production activities, the increase in prices also affects those other activities, which tend to shrink in production and employment because of higher input prices.<a href=\"#fn7\"><sup>7</sup></a> Primary products that before were transformed locally are now exported as raw materials and the domestic industry declines.
