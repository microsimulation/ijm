The suggested approach draws upon existing third-party tax-benefit calculators and provides an alternative to integration of tax functions within a dynamic structure. It has the advantages of adapting to the degree of household sector detail described by a model and permits taxes and benefits to be imputed directly from commonly available micro-data sources. A practical application to a dynamic programming model designed to reflect the contemporary UK policy context indicates that the proposed method for projecting taxes and benefits implies a comparable computational burden and generates qualitatively comparable results to a detailed functional description of fiscal policy, while simplifying model development.",

Although this type of abstraction helps to simplify model specification, it also limits scope for contributing to public policy debate and exposes model projections to distortions that may be difficult to anticipate. This study demonstrates a new method that simplifies the task of projecting realistic tax and benefit payments in a dynamic heterogenous household model.",
