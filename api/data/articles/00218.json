The proposed technique is used in many fields of science when analyzing transitions longitudinally. The statistical method applied in this study is based on sequence analysis (SA) used to identify similar and dissimilar individual transition patterns over longitudinal measurements. We briefly introduce the statistical basis of SA and discuss its use in the dynamic microsimulation context. We also report our results from the Finnish ELSI model to illustrate labor market transitions near retirement. SA is available in many popular statistical software packages such as R and Stata. The programming code for SA and data simulations are also given. Our conclusion is that SA is a useful tool also in a microsimulation context, in visualizing and validating simulated model transitions when statistically more sophisticated mixture modeling are not applicable.",

In a nutshell, the four approaches of SA are: (1) an approach-based on duration models, (2) an event sequences approach, (3) a level-based approach, and (4) a network-based approach. All these techniques are useful and relate to specific study-designs and measurements in empirical research. In a microsimulation context, however, approach (2), also defined as the state sequence technique, is the most promising. This study demonstrates the state sequence approach. Related to different applications of SA, microsimulation practitioners could also benefit from materials of the international organization promoting the use of SA (sequenceanalysis.org).",

Similarity is defined in terms of the number, order, and duration of states within sequences. The OMA algorithm calculates the similarity/dissimilarity between two sequences by taking into account three possible operations: replacement (one state is replaced by another), insertion (an additional state is added to the sequence), and deletion (a state is deleted from the sequence). The fewer operations needed to turn one sequence into the other, the more similar the two sequences are, and vice versa. Furthermore, a certain cost can be attached to each operation. Therefore, identifying the relative cost of all operations is critical in determining the similarity or dissimilarity between individual sequences. These steps of OMA require an ex ante definition by the researcher, with little objective measures of the correct specification. The results can be highly sensitive to these specifications (see <a href=\"#bib8\">Brzinsky-Fay and Kohler, 2010</a>). Finally, the distance between two sequences is defined by the minimum cost of the operations that are necessary to transform one sequence into the other (<a href=\"#bib4\">Abbott and Tsay, 2000</a>). The distances are recorded in a dissimilarity matrix. A more technical discussion on the details of SA and OMA are found in <a href=\"#bib28\">Studer and Ritschard (2014)</a>.",

The main aim of the HCA is to minimize the within-cluster cluster distance by combining clusters hierarchically. The researcher needs to specify the number of clusters to be extracted from the data either heuristically (e.g., visually inspecting) or by using fit statistics. Once the clusters are determined, they can be described with respect to the variables (model states) required to create the clusters. The clusters can be used both as independent and dependent variables in further analyses. However, they should be used with caution, since there is no generally accepted definition of a cluster and therefore also a different clustering technique can easily yield to a completely different clustering structure.",

Because the results can be sensitive to the chosen indel and substitution costs, it is good practice to perform sensitivity analyses with various indel costs (e.g., 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5), and to use both a constant substitution matrix as well as a matrix based on the frequency of transitions. The number of clusters can be assessed by two measures of average cluster linkage: the Calinski\u2013Harabasz pseudo-F index (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cali\u0144ski and Harabasz, 1974</a>) and the Duda\u2013Hart index (<a href=\"#bib12\">Duda et al., 2001</a>). These statistics help determine the optimal number of clusters by comparing the ratio of the within-cluster distances to the between-cluster distances. The Duda-Hart index could be preferred as it also produces a pseudo T-statistics. Once the optimal number of clusters is established, cluster assignment can be further applied as the response variable in a multinomial logistic regression model.

Another issue related to the nature of the outcomes is related to the interleaving of states. In typical univariate TA, one outcome (e.g. employed) is analyzed at a time. However, multivariate TA modeling allows several outcomes to be analyzed simultaneously (e.g. employed, studying, unemployed, on sick leave). In SA, the question of interleaving states is more complicated. The obvious practical approach then is to define an exact unambiguous state for every relevant labor market state that an individual can have (employed, studying, employed while studying, etc.) during a single observation period or time point.

Second, full employment is the mainstream state at age 55, but after that, there are several possible transition paths. Unemployment, sickness spells and other career breaks become more common before retirement. Retirement on a disability pension also increases after age 55.

Selecting the number of sub-groups using BIC criterion (k=2 to 6: -2316.8, -1980.4, 1888.8, 1832.7 and -<span class=\"underline\">1819.2</span>) indicates that a six-group solution yields the best statistical model fit. By subjective evaluation of the solution, the results are reasonable. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> shows the employment trajectories, that is, the group averages of six sub-groups. We can see that there are two groups with sizes 27% and 7% with relatively high and stable probabilities of employment until old-age retirement. There are also two groups with sizes 11% and 24% with gradually decreasing probability of employment with age. Finally, there are groups with sizes 25% and 7% with persistently low probability of employment.",
