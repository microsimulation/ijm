                "text": "This paper describes a new methodology for the analysis of socio-cultural conflicts in situations where actual conflict information is lacking, but survey data on socio-cultural opinions are available. The methodology is based on an innovative combination of three different approaches: (i) Social network analysis, (ii) microsimulation, and (iii) inferential statistics. Virtual encounters within and across the borders of countries are simulated by randomly matching pairs of persons who answered the same interview questions in the European Values Study 1999/2000, but may be supposed to never have met in real life. The results of these encounters are stored as a new type of dyadic data record. Among other things, each of these dyadic records contains information about the degree of dissent between citizens with regard to various types of work-related values such as obedience to superiors, meritocratism, or work ethos. By aggregation of these simulated value conflicts it becomes possible to anticipate future conflicts within and between groups of natives and immigrants. If conflicts between natives and immigrants are stronger than the corresponding conflicts within each of the two groups, a cleavage situation is predicted, which often results in a ghettoization of immigrated minorities. By focusing on certain categories of immigrants with similar socioeconomic status or age, the analysis can further be refined such that it may also be instrumental for conceptualizing new immigration policies. This is illustrated through an exploration of the potential consequences of Polish migration to Germany.",

These quasi-identical surveys can be used for conflict simulations if one assumes that interpersonal contacts are in modern societies at least partially at random. One of the classical distinctions between modern and traditional societies is the role of the stranger (<a href=\"#bib28\">Toennies, 1979</a>:34 ff.): in traditional societies the stranger is an exceptional figure, whereas in modern societies he or she represents a common everyday experience. Our daily blog- and e-mail-contacts are just exemplary illustrations of these anonymous random networks.

Traditional cleavage analysis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lijphart, 1975</a>: Chapter 2; <a href=\"#bib22\">Rae &amp; Taylor, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Svallfors, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bartolini, 2000</a>: Chapter 1) mainly focuses on inter-group conflicts. This is not very satisfactory, as there is no \u2018natural\u2019 threshold which distinguishes situations of \u2018normal\u2019 inter-group conflict from situations of \u2018increased\u2019 conflict \u2013 the latter pointing to a socio-cultural <i>cleavage</i> between two groups. Thus, this article proposes to use the respective <i>internal</i> levels of conflict of groups A and B as the \u2018natural\u2019 <i>points of reference</i> for analysis of inter-group conflict <i>between</i> groups A and B. From the perspective of group A, conflicts between A and B are only perceived as an expression of a cleavage if these conflicts are higher than the internal conflicts of A. Similarly, for group B, a cleavage between A and B only exists if the inter-group conflicts between A and B are higher than the internal conflicts of B. Consequently, as there are two different points of reference, cleavages may be asymmetrical. Intergroup conflicts, which may appear serious from the perspective of one of the two groups, are not necessarily perceived this way by the other. This obviously complements the conventional binary cleavage typology with consideration of a range of new conflict types, as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, where nine possible conflict-situations between natives and immigrants are presented.",

Both forms of behaviour may occur independently of the other. If the <i>immigrants</i> but not the natives perceive a real conflict, the cleavage becomes asymmetrical and <i>retreatism</i> prevails (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, types A3 and A4). If the situation is inversely asymmetrical and the <i>natives</i> but not the immigrants perceive a real conflict, <i>exclusion</i> of the immigrants is hypothesized to be the prevalent behaviour of the natives (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, types A1 and A2). Finally, there are those situations in which the interaction with the other group results in conflicts lower or equal to <i>both</i> levels of internal conflict, in which case cleavages are consequently totally absent. It is hypothesized that in this situation peaceful <i>co-existence</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, types N1 to N3) or <i>integration</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, type N4) would be the dominant forms of behaviour, depending on how the immigrants perceive the external conflict.",

However, these workers do constitute a relatively important group of immigrants to Germany (<a href=\"#bib21\">OECD, 2008</a>: 143). All other socio-economic status groups do not produce real cleavages with regard to the work value of obedience. This also holds for the highest status group 4, i.e. the upper and upper middle class. At first, their cleavage situation seems to differ. However, their internal and external levels of conflict do not differ in a statistically significant way. Hence, the type and amount of conflict generated by Polish immigration seems to depend on the socio-economic status of the immigrants and may thus be influenced by an appropriate immigration-policy, which limits mass-immigration of people belonging to class 2.",

According to <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, there is a U-shaped relation between the socio-economic status of the immigrants and their conflicts with the native German population. Consequently, if the statistical significance of the differences in the level of conflict is taken into account, there is also a qualitative variation between Polish status-groups and the type of cleavage experienced: the unskilled manual workers in class 1 are exposed to cleavage type A3 (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), classes 2 and 3 to cleavage type A4 (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and for the highest class, 4, there seems to be no cleavage (type N1 in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). For Polish immigrants exposed to cleavage A3 or A4 there is probably a tendency to retreat from German society due to external value conflicts about work ethos, which are much higher than the corresponding internal Polish point of reference. There are at least two ways to alleviate this problem via immigration policy. One of them is to give preference to immigrants from class 4. Although these people seem to fit quite well into German society, the number of appropriate jobs is probably very limited. The other solution is to promote the immigration of status-group 3. This policy minimizes the inter-group conflict but does not really solve it.",

For reasons of simplicity, these methods often compare groups by <i>aggregate</i> statistics such as mean values, and consequently draw wrong conclusions about the amount of conflict between the individual members of the analyzed groups. Virtual-encounter simulations avoid this type of ecological fallacy by simulating inter-individual conflicts. <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> illustrates the difference between the two approaches for conflicts about work ethos. By using the <i>difference of group means</i> of the Polish and the Germans, one systematically underestimates the amount of external conflict between the two groups, since these means do not accurately reflect the individual variation with regard to work ethos. Even worse, when operationalizing external conflict by the difference of aggregate group-means, the <i>shape</i> of the relation between socioeconomic status and conflict is totally different from the corresponding results of the virtual encounter simulations (see <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>).",
