The first, by Janne Salonen and co-authors, is a methodological paper, where the authors propose to use methods from trajectory analysis to interpret the outcomes of dynamic microsimulations. Trajectory analysis is widely used in Sociology with the aim of identifying commonalities and differences in observed trajectories and classify individuals accordingly. The application of these concepts to microsimulation is potentially very promising, and the paper provides an excellent example and guide for other researchers.",

The novelty of the paper lies in the combined modelling of farm and forestry income (and the relationship between the two), considering the incentives provided by the tax-benefit system. The paper is also an example of an application of tax-benefit (static) microsimulation modelling to areas which are normally left outside the scope of the analysis, such as agricultural subsidies.",

The paper, by Christian Brinch, Dennis Fredriksen and Ola Vestad (<a href=\"#bib1\">Brinch et al., 2018</a>), looks at claiming behaviour in the Norwegian public pension system; the evolution of pension contributions is modelled with the MOSART microsimulation model. The specific research question of the paper is whether there is adverse selection, that is whether people with private information on their shorter-than-average life expectancy engage in early claim, exploiting a unique feature of the Norwegian system where claiming and retiring decisions are largely decoupled. The authors find that there is adverse selection, but that its effects are rather limited. The paper is interesting in addressing a question of general interest in the design of public pension systems \u2013 the degree of flexibility allowed \u2013 with state of the art econometric techniques. Microsimulation is used, but the focus of the paper is not the microsimulation model itself. Consequently, no description of the model is included in the paper. However, a reader interested in the MOSART model would be referred to a rather old working paper (<a href=\"#bib3\">Fredriksen, 1998</a>), with the comprehensive review of dynamic microsimulation models of <a href=\"#bib5\">Li and O\u2019Donoghue (2013)</a> only adding a slightly more recent conference proceedings (<a href=\"#bib4\">Fredriksen, 2003</a>). This highlights the importance of an outlet such the International Journal of Microsimulation, where models can be described at a greater length than normally feasible in broader research articles.",
