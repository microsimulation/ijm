                "text": "This study aimed to estimate the spatially explicit impact of a 20% proposed tax on sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption across small areas within the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). The study is important in the context of informing ongoing debate around a proposal to introduce a 20% tax on the sugar content of SSBs. A microsimulation analysis was used to estimate current expenditure on SSBs and the impact of a tax at a small area level across the ACT. Population data from the Census was used to weight survey data from the Household Expenditure Survey. A microsimulation model was then applied to the data to estimate current expenditure on SSBs, and the tax impact of a 20% sugar tax on SSBs. The impact of a sugar tax falls unequally across regions of the ACT with the tax impact representing a higher proportion of income for areas with lower socioeconomic advantage. The current expenditure ($/household/annum) averaged around $300 and the tax impact of the proposed sugar tax as a percentage of income averaged around 0.12%/household/annum. The unequal distribution of tax impact estimated by the model suggests that coupling the tax with targeted exercise and nutrition programs as well as systemic change will both be required to reduce inequalities and increase the likelihood of positive health outcomes around overweight and obesity and related conditions.",

Microsimulation models perform detailed analysis of specific activities based on the data at an individual level (<a href=\"#bib19\">Tanton, 2013</a>). Microsimulation modelling is often used to evaluate the effect of proposed interventions before they are implemented in the real world, and are mainly used to simulate government programs, demographic and economic changes for current policies or alternative scenarios.

For each SA2 region, the household weight for each HES record is adjusted, based on the eight benchmark categories above and the two characteristics of the HES person record (<a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>), so that the sum of adjusted household weights over the HES sample matches the total population of the SA2 (according to the most recent census). The adjustment is done using the generalised regression method (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bell, 2000</a>). The result is a static, spatially reweighted microsimulation model. Persons aged 0 \u2013 15 years are accounted for indirectly, in the benchmarks via the family type and number of people in the household. The age, sex and labour force benchmarks are combined to create a single variable with 12 categories, and 0 \u2013 15 year olds do not have a labour force status. Occasionally the reweighting algorithm cannot converge using all eight benchmarks, for example when the SA2 has properties that are significantly different from the \u201caverage\u201d, such as no low rent or mortgage payments in a wealthy suburb or only a small number of large family units in an inner-city area. In this case one of the benchmarks is dropped and the process re-run until convergence is reached. Most SA2s, however, converge on the first attempt, which gives the best estimate of SA2 weight. For each SA2, the new adjusted weights are used to calculate total expenditure in sugary drinks (which is a HES variable), the total expenditure per person in the SA2 and also the scenario when expenditure is 20% higher due to the imposition of a sugary drinks tax.",

A 20% sugar tax on SSBs in Australia is estimated to raise an extra $80 per person in the highest consumption SA2\u2019s in the ACT. However, the impact of the tax will likely be disproportionately felt in the suburbs that are socio-economically disadvantaged. Previous studies in Australia have estimated modest reductions in BMI and substantial reductions in health care expenditure (<a href=\"#bib25\">Veerman et al., 2016</a>), particularly in the most disadvantaged areas (<a href=\"#bib13\">Lal et al., 2017</a>). Some studies e.g. <a href=\"#bib9\">Colchero et al. (2016)</a> show that middle and low SES households had larger decreases in consumption than high SES households, after the introduction of a sugar tax in Mexico. Hence the health benefits of a sugar tax may be felt more strongly in the lower income households.",

A tax on SSBs provides an incentive for people to opt for a cheaper drink, and thereby pay less tax. If such a drink happens to have less sugar, then positive health outcomes flow as discussed above. Furthermore the same tax encourages companies to reduce the sugar content of drinks in order that their products fall into lower tax brackets (<a href=\"#bib6\">Buckton et al., 2019</a>). The combined effect of outcomes like these is that income is freed up for people in the lower quintiles of income distributions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Lal et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Backholer et al., 2016</a>).",

Firstly, the model is static and does not include response to the implementation of a sugar tax over time. The health benefits of such a tax are therefore not part of the outputs of this model. Direct and concurrent knowledge of elasticities and the extent of product substitution in the face of a sugar tax are not available as Australia has not yet introduced such a tax. Estimates could be obtained from other research but are out of scope of this regional socio-economic model. Secondly, the reweighting method used in the modelling provides a synthetic estimate that calculates variation between SA2s based on differences in a range of benchmarks in the census such as income and household type (see <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>). The modelling does not specifically model or include area level effects. Thirdly, this paper has also not compared the tax effectiveness of non-spatial approaches to changes in purchasing power such lowering of the personal income tax of low-income earners, nor any impact at the household level rather than the individual.",

For example, future research along these lines could model elasticity (i.e. a reduction in expenditure due to increased price) to identify potential reduction in disease burden in most vulnerable areas. Models of the extent of product substitution as price of SSBs rise could also be undertaken. Measures of uncertainty around the estimated expenditure and tax impact would also provide a stronger interpretation of the results given here. Similar to <a href=\"#bib25\">Veerman et al. (2016)</a>, we modelled the impact of a valoric tax. Other mechanisms that include a tax on the quantity of sugar may have differential impacts on health (<a href=\"#bib17\">Sharma et al., 2014</a>) and socio-economically disadvantaged groups. Microsimulation is a population level approach and the original weighs in the HES are probabilistic. The ABS supplies a range of alternative weights, and future research could investigate the effect of different weighting schemes on estimates.",

Extension of this modelling to the whole of Australia and with a focus on specific demographics e.g. Indigenous Australians, would provide further evidence for the development of targeted and relevant health promotion activities. Both economic and social factors are an important part of the evidence base. The pricing of healthy food in remote communities is related to transport and storage costs and has been studied by <a href=\"#bib11\">Ferguson et al. (2018)</a>. The social determinants of consumption of SSBs in Indigenous communities have also been recently identified (<a href=\"#bib22\">Thurber et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Thurber et al., 2020</a>). Detailed analysis of differential impacts by socio-economic status and demographics should be the focus of future study. Policymakers could also note that when the notion of a sugar tax returns to stronger public debate, spatial effects should not be ignored.",

The current study is the first Australian study to report results of the likely impacts of an SSB tax at a high spatial resolution, including by small-area socio-economic disadvantage. A tax on SSBs has been promoted as an effective tool to reduce the burden of diseases attributable to sugary drink consumption and associated healthcare costs. However, the financial impact is likely to vary spatially, with a disproportionate impact on low-income populations. This impact however is not all negative, as low-income populations are also a group likely to benefit from lower sugar consumption.",
