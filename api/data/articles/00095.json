                "text": "Macroeconomic shocks such as movements in exchange rates or the terms of trade not only affect the overall economy but also affect different areas in a country in different ways, thus creating a spatial distribution of the shock. The effect on some regions is often larger than the national effect as regions differ in terms of resource endowments, economic activities, physical and human capital. The standard national CGE-Microsimulation framework is a useful approach to capture the distributional impacts of macro shocks on households at national and state and territory levels. However, the CGE-Microsimulation framework does not capture the distributional impact of a policy change or an external shock on small geographical areas of interest. To overcome this limitation, this paper extends the framework by linking a spatial microsimulation model to the national CGE-microsimulation framework in a top-down manner to capture the distribution of income in small areas of a macro shock. We simulate a potential decline in Australian terms of trade over 2012\u201313 to 2017\u201318 and find significant differences in the spatial distribution of the impacts of the shock.",

In the case of Australia, <a href=\"#bib3\">Behrens <i>et al.</i> (2007)</a> find that the positive impact of trade can be hampered by relatively higher transport costs in mainland rural areas of Australia. Furthermore, greater openness in trade (i.e. the ease of the flow of factors of production and technology in and out of a country) may impact not only on income inequality but also asset inequalities, spatial inequalities, and gender inequalities (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anderson 2005</a>).",

Given the benefit that the Australian economy experienced from rising terms of trade, there are concerns that the downward trend could not only harm the economy but also change the income distribution among households in different locations in Australia.

STINMOD calculates the distribution of the household income (cross-classified over a number of household characteristics) at the national level (which can be disaggregated into State and Territory levels), after taking into account the tax and transfer payments (link 3 in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). However, the distribution of household income may not fully represent small geographical areas of interest, given that small areas are not normally captured by national sample surveys on which STINMOD is based. To capture the impacts in small areas we link STINMOD to SpatialMSM, a spatial microsimulation model of the Australian population (<a href=\"#bib28\">Tanton <i>et al.</i>, 2011</a>), which derives datasets of small areas using Census data and data from official ABS sample surveys to capture household details in small areas. The output from STINMOD, that is, the distribution of household income at the national or state/territory levels, net of tax and transfer payments, is passed to SpatialMSM to calculate the distribution of household income (cross-classified over a number of household characteristics) in small geographical areas (link 4 in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).",

STINMOD estimates the changes in household income and federal tax and transfer payments for each different household observed in the microdata (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lambert <i>et al.</i> 1994</a>). STINMOD therefore has two important components: a database and the Tax and Transfer rules of the Commonwealth of Australia. The STINMOD database is based on the national Income and Housing and Household Expenditure Survey (but includes data from other sources as well). The database used in this simulation is based on the 2009/2010 survey. The Tax and Transfer rules of the Commonwealth (which largely changes with each annual budget announcement of the Commonwealth) is applied to the unit data in the database to assess the tax-transfer payments to different types of households represented nationally.",

A household identifier in the database assigns the person to a unique household. This is an important feature of this database that allows us to connect the results from the CGE model to STINMOD as the person records contain the industry and occupation detail that can be mapped to the industry and occupation dimensions of the CGE model. The household identification will also be important as the tax and transfer are largely calculated based on the characteristics of the household including its income, number of dependents and the type of tenure arrangements of the households. Passing the output of the ORANI CGE model, namely the employment and wages by industry and occupation \u2013 the linking aggregate variables (LAVs) \u2013 to STINMOD, we achieve two outcomes. First, STINMOD takes movements in industry by occupation employment and wages from the CGE model and distributes them across the persons belonging to respective household types represented at the national level. Second, STINMOD calculates the movements in household income (cross-classified across a number of household characteristics) after taking into account the tax and transfer payment rules applicable to each household type represented in the total population.",

This is akin to a policy simulation in STINMOD of the terms of trade shock. A reweighting approach is used to accommodate the movements in industry employment by occupation passed down by the CGE model. The reweighting method used here is called GREGWT developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bell, 2000</a>) and is based on a generalized regression method of <a href=\"#bib26\">Singh and Mohl (1996)</a>. <a href=\"#bib7\">Buddelmeyer <i>et al.</i> (2012)</a> uses a similar approach to analyse the forecast distributive impacts of climatic change in Australia. One important aspect of this reweighting process is the benchmark table (<a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>). This table contains critical information on household/individual characteristics such as age, education, occupation and household type represented in the population. In this simulation, STINMOD takes the changes in employment passed down by the CGE model by changing the number or proportion of workers in every industry and occupation, while ensuring that the other characteristics such as age and education structure remain unchanged.",

In order to find impacts on SLAs, we link the results of STINMOD to SpatialMSM, a spatial microsimulation model of the Australian economy. Spatial microsimulation is a technique used to derive datasets to represent the population in small areas. SpatialMSM is designed to allocate private income, tax paid and transfer received for each person on the database, as well as the changes in the weights that capture the employment impact, to the small areas \u2013 the SLAs in Australia. The SpatialMSM microsimulation model uses a reweighting procedure to reweight the micro data set of STINMOD to the Census benchmarks for each SLA, thus creating a synthetic household dataset for each of them. This dataset is then used to generate household characteristics of interest to analyse the distributional impacts of a policy change on a small area (<a href=\"#bib14\">Harding <i>et al.</i> 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">Tanton <i>et al.</i> 2009</a>), such as an SLA.",

In this case, the model reports a non-convergence error. This reported error is then used to test the accuracy of the model and those areas that do not converge are excluded from the small area statistics produced. We find that 229 of the 1392 SLAs are to be excluded from further analysis since the process could not produce a reasonable solution for them (non-convergence).

The model is also able to separate the impact of the employment effect and the wages effect. The changes in the employment composition due to the drop in the TOT may actually increase the overall income. However, the impact is very small while the negative impact from the decrease in wages per person in different industry and occupation is much higher. This means that the current employment levels could realistically be retained only if employees were willing to take a wage cut.

Although the income structure plays a role in Government transfer payments, income is not the only factor determining transfer payments, so changes in Government transfer payments are more likely to be determined by the distribution of different household characteristics among regions in Australia. As a result, our estimation does not indicate a huge difference in changes to Government transfer payments between areas. The relatively higher increase in capital cities is more likely due to the greater fall in the household incomes in those areas. The impact also seems to be spread more evenly around capital cities. There are some suburbs in Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra that we estimate will receive higher increases in transfer payments. One argument that can be offered for this is the spread of children in these areas. For example, Gungahlin in the North of Canberra and Tuggeranong in the South of Canberra have relatively high increases. Both these are fairly new areas with a higher proportion of young families.",

Disposable income is the amount that is available for households to spend on goods and services, so it takes out tax paid from gross income. One of the advantages of the type of analysis used for this model is that disposable incomes can be calculated from the base dataset. One of the major differences between the change in disposable income compared to the change in gross income is that the East Coast area no longer experiences a large drop in disposable income. This is likely due to the large tax reduction estimated for the area. The estimated tax reduction has also reduced the reduction in incomes in capital cities such as Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart, and to some extent Brisbane and Perth. This means the income fall is mainly concentrated in Canberra and to a lesser extent Darwin.",

We find that government transfer payments were not as affected by the TOT decline compared to income and tax paid as these payments are not entirely dependent on incomes. This linking of CGE and microsimulation models is a useful framework, as it is able to show the regional/spatial impacts of a macro-economic policy or external shock that enables policy makers and researchers to identify the areas affected most by such shocks.",

This may not always be true as the market behaviour in regional areas can be different to the national market behaviour. In addition, the relationship between different regions has only been captured by the relationship between different industrial sectors.
