Given that wealth is not recorded in the EU-SILC based EUROMOD standard input data, the extension is done by creating new input data using the second wave (2017) of the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). The authors motivate the choice of building new input datasets rather than using HFCS as a donor dataset to the standard EUROMOD input data to fully exploit the oversampling of the wealthier population and the multiple imputation procedure used in HFCS to deal with selective item non-response. The extension builds on previous work by some of the same authors (<a href=\"#bib3\">Kuypers et al., 2016</a>) and currently covers 17 EU countries, with policies updated up to 2017. Unfortunately, the extension is for the time being not available for research.",

The model simulates demographic events, from ageing to transition to adulthood, partnership formation and dissolution, fertility, and migration; educational attainment at secondary and tertiary-school level; labour market events such as entries to the labour force and career progression; social security policies including pensions, health and long-term care. Labour supply is endogenously determined in the model, while labour demand is obtained from a separate macro model. The matching of labour supply and demand is modelled by sector of activity and education, in order to estimate the quantitative and the qualitative skill mismatch. Validation is performed on the period 2009-2017, with encouraging results. With these features, IrpetDin stands out as one of the most complete dynamic models in the literature. Unfortunately, the model is not openly available, but the authors can be contacted for access.",

They deal with the problem of imputing consumption data into a dataset that contains information on individual incomes. This is relevant for instance when a tax-benefit model is extended to include indirect taxes, as in <a href=\"#bib5\">O\u2019Donoghue et al. (2018)</a>, given that consumption and income data are seldom available in a single dataset. The authors compare five different techniques to impute expenditures into income datasets: parametric estimation of Engel curves, non-parametric estimation, both constrained and unconstrained matching using a distance function and grade correspondence. They then test the five methods on artificial data. They find that the parametric and non-parametric estimation yield the best results, generating imputed values that are closest to the pseudo-true values for the budget shares.",

This US model will be of interest to microsimulation modellers and health workforce planners alike. It has three distinct advantages. The first is that it takes account of demand as well as supply. The second is the comprehensive coverage of many different health professions and numerous medical subspecialties. The third is that it can simulate the impacts of some health interventions, with a focus on prevention, as well as policy change (such as increased medical insurance coverage, reducing barriers to access and altered staff to patient ratios). It can also model health labour force supply changes (such as the number of new graduates, retirement patterns, and hours of work). Like many health workforce modellers, this group had to deal with many fragmented data sources. The documentation, available online at <a href=\"https://cdn.ihs.com/www/pdf/1118/Health-Workforce-Microsimulation-Model.pdf\">https://cdn.ihs.com/www/pdf/1118/Health-Workforce-Microsimulation-Model.pdf</a>, provides a very useful framework for the scope of a flexible health workforce model using microsimulation techniques.",

Rahman points out that this is a good read paper, which should be of interest to our community. The authors present a dynamic microsimulation model for projecting the health of individuals, considering interactions between socio-demographic characteristics, health, mortality, bio-medical and behavioural risk factors. The model, labelled ATHLOS-Mic, provides long-term projections (2015-2060) for the health trajectories of the elderly population aged 65 and over, for 14 EU Countries, under different scenarios. The model is somewhat close to APPSIM at NATSEM. The model is described in the paper in a detailed and stepwise manner, with some specified equations. The paper also includes an interesting sensitivity analysis; however, validation is largely missing.",
